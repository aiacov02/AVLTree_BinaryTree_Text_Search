This program takes as input 2 files from the arguments. the first file contains a text
and its words are stored in a binary tree and an avl tree.The second file contains
the words which are going to be searched in the text. The program prints the time
in milliseconds needed to insert all the words in each of the trees. Then the program searches
each word in the text and prints in which positions in the text the word was found. The program also 
prints the time in milliseconds the searching algorithm of the words took for each tree.

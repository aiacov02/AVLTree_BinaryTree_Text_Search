 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god and sosthenes the brother
 to the church of god which is in corinth to those who have been made holy in christ jesus saints by the selection of god with all those who in every place give honour to the name of our lord jesus christ their lord and ours
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 i give praise to my god for you at all times because of the grace of god which has been given to you in christ jesus
 so that in him you have wealth in all things in word and in knowledge of every sort
 even as the witness of the christ has been made certain among you
 so that having every grace you are living in the hope of the revelation of our lord jesus christ
 who will give you strength to the end to be free from all sin in the day of our lord jesus christ
 god is true through whom you have been given a part with his son jesus christ our lord
 now i make request to you my brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ that you will all say the same thing and that there may be no divisions among you so that you may be in complete agreement in the same mind and in the same opinion
 because it has come to my knowledge through those of the house of chloe that there are divisions among you my brothers
 that is that some of you say i am of paul some say i am of apollos some say i am of cephas and some say i am christs
 is there a division in christ was paul nailed to the cross for you or were you given baptism in the name of paul
 i give praise to god that not one of you had baptism from me but crispus and gaius
 so that no one may be able to say that you had baptism in my name
 and i gave baptism to the house of stephanas but i am not certain that any others had baptism from me
 for christ sent me not to give baptism but to be a preacher of the good news not with wise words for fear that the cross of christ might be made of no value
 for the word of the cross seems foolish to those who are on the way to destruction but to us who are on the way to salvation it is the power of god
 as it says in the holy writings i will put an end to the wisdom of the wise and will put on one side the designs of those who have knowledge
 where is the wise where is he who has knowledge of the law where is the man of this world who has a love of discussion has not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
 for because by the purpose of god the world with all its wisdom had not the knowledge of god it was gods pleasure by so foolish a thing as preaching to give salvation to those who had faith in him
 seeing that the jews make request for signs and the greeks are looking for knowledge
 but we give the good news of christ on the cross a hard thing to the jews and a foolish thing to the gentiles
 but to those of gods selection jews and greeks christ is the power and the wisdom of god
 because what seems foolish in god is wiser than men and what seems feeble in god is stronger than men
 for you see gods design for you my brothers that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh not the strong not the noble
 but god made selection of the foolish things of this world so that he might put the wise to shame and the feeble things that he might put to shame the strong
 and the low things of the world and the things without honour did god make selection of yes even the things which are not so that he might make as nothing the things which are
 so that no flesh might have glory before god
 but god has given you a place in christ jesus through whom god has given us wisdom and righteousness and salvation and made us holy
 so that as it is said in the holy writings whoever has a desire for glory let his glory be in the lord
 for it is my desire my brothers that you may keep in mind how all our fathers were under the cloud and they all went through the sea
 and they all had baptism from moses in the cloud and in the sea
 and they all took the same holy food
 and the same holy drink for they all took of the water from the holy rock which came after them and the rock was christ
 but with most of them god was not pleased for they came to their end in the waste land
 now these things were for an example to us so that our hearts might not go after evil things as they did
 then do not go after false gods as some of them did as it is said in the holy writings after resting and feasting the people got up to take their pleasure
 again let us not give way to the desires of the flesh as some of them did of whom twenty three thousand came to their end in one day
 and let us not put the lord to the test as some of them did and came to their death by snakes
 and do not say evil things against the lord as some of them did and destruction overtook them
 now these things were done as an example and were put down in writing for our teaching on whom the last days have come
 so let him who seems to himself to be safe go in fear of a fall
 you have been put to no test but such as is common to man and god is true who will not let any test come on you which you are not able to undergo but he will make with the test a way out of it so that you may be able to go through it
 for this cause my dear brothers give no worship to false gods
 what i am saying is for wise men do you be the judges of it
 the cup of blessing which we take does it not give us a part in the blood of christ and is not the broken bread a taking part in the body of christ
 because we being a number of persons are one bread we are one body for we all take part in the one bread
 see israel after the flesh do not those who take as food the offerings of the altar take a part in the altar
 do i say then that what is offered to images is anything or that the image is anything
 what i say is that the things offered by the gentiles are offered to evil spirits and not to god and it is not my desire for you to have any part with evil spirits
 it is not possible for you at the same time to take the cup of the lord and the cup of evil spirits you may not take part in the table of the lord and the table of evil spirits
 or may we be the cause of envy to the lord are we stronger than he
 we are free to do all things but there are things which it is not wise to do we are free to do all things but not all things are for the common good
 let a man give attention not only to what is good for himself but equally to his neighbours good
 whatever meat may be had at the public market take as food without question of right or wrong
 for the earth is the lords and all things in it
 if a gentile makes a feast for you and you are pleased to go as a guest take whatever is put before you without question of right or wrong
 but if anyone says to you this food has been used as an offering do not take it on account of him who said it and on account of his sense of right and wrong
 right and wrong i say not for you but for the other man for the fact that i am free is not dependent on another mans sense of right or wrong
 but if i give praise to god for the food which i take let no man say evil of me for that reason
 so then if it is a question of food or drink or any other thing whatever you do do all to the glory of god
 give no cause of trouble to jews or to greeks or to the church of god
 even as i give way to all men in all things not looking for profit for myself but for the good of others that they may get salvation
 so take me for your example even as i take christ for mine
 now i am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you
 but it is important for you to keep this fact in mind that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
 every man who takes part in prayer or gives teaching as a prophet with his head covered puts shame on his head
 but every woman who does so with her head unveiled puts shame on her head for it is the same as if her hair was cut off
 for if a woman is not veiled let her hair be cut off but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off let her be veiled
 for it is not right for a man to have his head covered because he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man
 for the man did not come from the woman but the woman from the man
 and the man was not made for the woman but the woman for the man
 for this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head because of the angels
 but the woman is not separate from the man and the man is not separate from the woman in the lord
 for as the woman is from the man so the man is through the woman but all things are from god
 be judges yourselves of the question does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled
 does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair it is a cause of shame to him
 but if a woman has long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given to her for a covering
 but if any man will not be ruled in this question this is not our way of doing things and it is not done in the churches of god
 but in giving you this order there is one thing about which i am not pleased it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse
 for first of all it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church there are divisions among you and i take the statement to be true in part
 for divisions are necessary among you in order that those who have gods approval may be clearly seen among you
 but now when you come together it is not possible to take the holy meal of the lord
 for when you take your food everyone takes his meal before the other and one has not enough food and another is the worse for drink
 what have you not houses to take your meals in or have you no respect for the church of god putting the poor to shame what am i to say to you am i to give you praise certainly not
 for it was handed down to me from the lord as i gave it to you that the lord jesus on the night when judas was false to him took bread
 and when it had been broken with an act of praise he said this is my body which is for you do this in memory of me
 in the same way with the cup after the meal he said this cup is the new testament in my blood do this whenever you take it in memory of me
 for whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the lords death till he comes
 if then anyone takes the bread or the cup of the lord in the wrong spirit he will be responsible for the body and blood of the lord
 but let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself
 for a man puts himself in danger if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the lords body
 for this cause a number of you are feeble and ill and a number are dead
 but if we were true judges of ourselves punishment would not come on us
 but if punishment does come it is sent by the lord so that we may be safe when the world is judged
 so then my brothers when you come together to the holy meal of the lord let there be waiting for one another
 if any man is in need of food let him take his meal in his house so that you may not come together to your damage and the rest i will put in order when i come
 but about the things of the spirit my brothers it is not right for you to be without teaching
 you are conscious that when you were gentiles in whatever way you were guided you went after images without voice or power
 so it is my desire for you to be clear about this that no one is able to say by the spirit of god that jesus is cursed and no one is able to say that jesus is lord but by the holy spirit
 now there are different qualities given to men but the same spirit
 and there are different sorts of servants but the same lord
 and there are different operations but the same god who is working all things in all
 but to every man some form of the spirits working is given for the common good
 for to one are given words of wisdom through the spirit and to another words of knowledge through the same spirit
 to another faith in the same spirit and to another the power of taking away disease by the one spirit
 and to another the power of working wonders and to another the prophets word and to another the power of testing spirits to another different sorts of tongues and to another the power of making clear the sense of the tongues
 but all these are the operations of the one and the same spirit giving to every man separately as his pleasure is
 for as the body is one and has a number of parts and all the parts make one body so is christ
 for through the baptism of the one spirit we were all formed into one body jews or greeks servants or free men and were all made full of the same spirit
 for the body is not one part but a number of parts
 if the foot says because i am not the hand i am not a part of the body it is no less a part of the body
 and if the ear says because i am not the eye i am not a part of the body it is a part of the body all the same
 if all the body was an eye where would be the hearing if all was hearing where would be the smelling
 but now god has put every one of the parts in the body as it was pleasing to him
 and if they were all one part where would the body be
 but now they are all different parts but one body
 and the eye may not say to the hand i have no need of you or again the head to the feet i have no need of you
 no those parts which seem to be feeble are the more necessary
 and to those parts of the body which seem to have less honour we give all the more honour and to those parts of the body which are a cause of shame to us we give the greater respect
 but those parts of the body which are beautiful have no need of such care and so the body has been joined together by god in such a way as to give more honour to those parts which had need of it
 so that there might be no division in the body but all the parts might have the same care for one another
 and if there is pain in one part of the body all the parts will be feeling it or if one part is honoured all the parts will be glad
 now you are the body of christ and every one of you the separate parts of it
 and god has put some in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers then those with wonder working powers then those with the power of taking away disease helpers wise guides users of strange tongues
 are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers have all the power of working wonders
 are all able to take away disease have all the power of tongues are all able to give their sense
 but let your desires be turned to the more important things given by the spirit and now i am pointing out to you an even better way
 if i make use of the tongues of men and of angels and have not love i am like sounding brass or a loud tongued bell
 and if i have a prophets power and have knowledge of all secret things and if i have all faith by which mountains may be moved from their place but have not love i am nothing
 and if i give all my goods to the poor and if i give my body to be burned but have not love it is of no profit to me
 love is never tired of waiting love is kind love has no envy love has no high opinion of itself love has no pride
 loves ways are ever fair it takes no thought for itself it is not quickly made angry it takes no account of evil
 it takes no pleasure in wrongdoing but has joy in what is true
 love has the power of undergoing all things having faith in all things hoping all things
 though the prophets word may come to an end tongues come to nothing and knowledge have no more value love has no end
 for our knowledge is only in part and the prophets word gives only a part of what is true
 but when that which is complete is come then that which is in part will be no longer necessary
 when i was a child i made use of a childs language i had a childs feelings and a childs thoughts now that i am a man i have put away the things of a child
 for now we see things in a glass darkly but then face to face now my knowledge is in part then it will be complete even as gods knowledge of me
 but now we still have faith hope love these three and the greatest of these is love
 go after love still desiring to have the things which the spirit gives but most of all that you may have the prophets power
 for he who makes use of tongues is not talking to men but to god because no one has the sense of what he is saying but in the spirit he is talking of secret things
 but the word of the prophet gives men knowledge and comfort and strength
 he who makes use of tongues may do good to himself but he who gives the prophets word does good to the church
 now though it is my desire for you all to have the power of tongues it would give me more pleasure to be hearing the prophets word from you for this is a greater thing than using tongues if the sense is not given at the same time for the good of the church
 but now my brothers if i come to you using tongues what profit will it be to you if i do not give you a revelation or knowledge or the word of the prophet or teaching
 even things without life having a voice such as a music pipe or other instrument if they do not give out different sounds who may be certain what is being played
 for if the war horn gives out an uncertain note who will get ready for the fight
 so if you in using a strange tongue say words which have no sense how will anyone take in what you are saying for you will be talking to the air
 there are it may be a number of different voices in the world and no voice is without sense
 but if the sense of the voice is not clear to me i am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking and he will be the same to me
 so if you are desiring the things which the spirit gives let your minds be turned first to the things which are for the good of the church
 for this reason let the man who has the power of using tongues make request that he may at the same time be able to give the sense
 for if i make use of tongues in my prayers my spirit makes the prayer but not my mind
 what then let my prayer be from the spirit and equally from the mind let my song be from the spirit and equally from mind
 for if you give a blessing with the spirit how will the man who has no knowledge say so be it after your prayer seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying
 for your giving of the blessing is certainly well done but of no profit to the man without knowledge
 i give praise to god that i am able to make use of tongues more than you all
 but in the church it would be better for me to make use of five words of which the sense was clear so that others might have profit than ten thousand words in a strange tongue
 my brothers do not be children in mind in evil be as little children but in mind be of full growth
 in the law it is said by men of other tongues and by strange lips will my words come to this people and not even so will they give ear to me says the lord
 for this reason tongues are for a sign not to those who have faith but to those who have not but the prophets word is for those who have faith and not for the rest who have not
 if then the church has come together and all are using tongues and there come in men without knowledge or faith will they not say that you are unbalanced
 but if all are teaching as prophets and a man without faith or knowledge comes in he is tested by all he is judged by all
 the secrets of his heart are made clear and he will go down on his face and give worship to god saying that god is truly among you
 what is it then my brothers when you come together everyone has a holy song or a revelation or a tongue or is giving the sense of it let everything be done for the common good
 if any man makes use of a tongue let it not be more than two or at the most three and in turn and let someone give the sense
 but if there is no one to give the sense let him keep quiet in the church and let his words be to himself and to god
 and let the prophets give their words but not more than two or three and let the others be judges of what they say
 but if a revelation is given to another who is seated near let the first be quiet
 for you may all be prophets in turn so that all may get knowledge and comfort
 and the spirits of the prophets are controlled by the prophets
 for god is not a god whose ways are without order but a god of peace as in all the churches of the saints
 let women keep quiet in the churches for it is not right for them to be talking but let them be under control as it says in the law
 and if they have a desire for knowledge about anything let them put questions to their husbands privately for talking in the church puts shame on a woman
 what was it from you that the word of god went out or did it only come in to you
 if any man seems to himself to be a prophet or to have the spirit let him take note of the things which i am writing to you as being the word of the lord
 but if any man is without knowledge let him be so
 so then my brothers let it be your chief desire to be prophets but let no one be stopped from using tongues
 let all things be done in the right and ordered way
 now i am going to make clear to you my brothers what the good news was which i gave to you and which you took and on which your faith is based
 by which you have salvation that is to say the form in which it was given to you if it is fixed in your minds and if your faith in it is not without effect
 for i gave to you first of all what was handed down to me how christ underwent death for our sins as it says in the writings
 and he was put in the place of the dead and on the third day he came back from the dead as it says in the writings
 and he was seen by cephas then by the twelve
 then by more than five hundred brothers at the same time most of whom are still living but some are sleeping
 then he was seen by james then by all the apostles
 and last of all as by one whose birth was out of the right time he was seen by me
 for i am the least of the apostles having no right to be named an apostle because of my cruel attacks on the church of god
 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was given to me has not been for nothing for i did more work than all of them though not i but the grace of god which was with me
 if then it is i who am the preacher or they this is our word and to this you have given your faith
 now if the good news says that christ came back from the dead how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead
 but if there is no coming back from the dead then christ has not come back from the dead
 and if christ did not come again from the dead then our good news and your faith in it are of no effect
 yes and we are seen to be false witnesses of god because we gave witness of god that by his power christ came again from the dead which is not true if there is no coming back from the dead
 for if it is not possible for the dead to come to life again then christ has not come to life again
 and if that is so your faith is of no effect you are still in your sins
 and in addition the dead in christ have gone to destruction
 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most unhappy
 but now christ has truly come back from the dead the first fruits of those who are sleeping
 for as by man came death so by man there is a coming back from the dead
 for as in adam death comes to all so in christ will all come back to life
 but every man in his right order christ the first fruits then those who are christs at his coming
 then comes the end when he will give up the kingdom to god even the father when he will have put an end to all rule and to all authority and power
 for his rule will go on till he has put all those who are against him under his feet
 the last power to come to an end is death
 for as it says he has put all things under his feet but when he says all things are put under him it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him
 and when all things have been put under him then will the son himself be under him who put all things under him so that god may be all in all
 again what will they do who are given baptism for the dead if the dead do not come back at all why are people given baptism for them
 and why are we in danger every hour
 yes truly by your pride in me my brothers in christ jesus our lord my life is one long death
 if after the way of men i was fighting with beasts at ephesus what profit is it to me if the dead do not come to life again let us take our pleasure in feasting for tomorrow we come to an end
 do not be tricked by false words evil company does damage to good behaviour
 be awake to righteousness and keep yourselves from sin for some have no knowledge of god i say this to put you to shame
 but someone will say how do the dead come back and with what sort of body do they come
 foolish man it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again
 and when you put it into the earth you do not put in the body which it will be but only the seed of grain or some other sort of plant
 but god gives it a body as it is pleasing to him and to every seed its special body
 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one flesh of men another of beasts another of birds and another of fishes
 and there are bodies of heaven and bodies of earth but the glory of the one is different from that of the other
 there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for the glory of one star is different from that of another
 so is it with the coming back from the dead it is planted in death it comes again in life
 it is planted in shame it comes again in glory feeble when it is planted it comes again in power
 it is planted a natural body it comes again as a body of the spirit if there is a natural body there is equally a body of the spirit
 and so it is said the first man adam was a living soul the last adam is a life giving spirit
 but that which is natural comes before that which is of the spirit
 the first man is from the earth and of the earth the second man is from heaven
 those who are of the earth are like the man who was from the earth and those who are of heaven are like the one from heaven
 and in the same way as we have taken on us the image of the man from the earth so we will take on us the image of the one from heaven
 now i say this my brothers that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of god and death may not have a part in life
 see i am giving you the revelation of a secret we will not all come to the sleep of death but we will all be changed
 in a second in the shutting of an eye at the sound of the last horn for at that sound the dead will come again free for ever from the power of death and we will be changed
 for this body which comes to destruction will be made free from the power of death and the man who is under the power of death will put on eternal life
 but when this has taken place then that which was said in the writings will come true death is overcome by life
 o death where is your power o death where are your pains
 the pain of death is sin and the power of sin is the law
 but praise be to god who gives us strength to overcome through our lord jesus christ
 for this cause my dear brothers be strong in purpose and unmoved ever giving yourselves to the work of the lord because you are certain that your work is not without effect in the lord
 now about the giving of money for the saints as i gave orders to the churches of galatia so do you
 on the first day of the week let every one of you put by him in store in measure as he has done well in business so that it may not be necessary to get money together when i come
 and when i come i will send the men of your selection with letters to take the money you have got together to jerusalem
 and if it is possible for me to go there they will go with me
 but i will come to you after i have gone through macedonia for that is my purpose
 but i may be with you for a time or even for the winter so that you may see me on my way wherever i go
 for it is not my desire to see you now on my way because it is my hope to be with you for some time if that is the lords pleasure
 but i will be at ephesus till pentecost
 for a great and important door there is open to me and there are a number of people against me
 now if timothy comes see that he is with you without fear because he is doing the lords work even as i am
 see then that he has the honour which is right but send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me for i am looking for him with the brothers
 but as for apollos the brother i had a great desire for him to come to you with the brothers but it was not his pleasure to come now but he will come when he has a chance
 be on the watch unmoved in the faith and be strong like men
 let all you do be done in love
 now i make my request to you my brothers for you have knowledge that the house of stephanas is the first fruits of achaia and that they have made themselves the servants of the saints
 that you put yourselves under such and under everyone who is helping the lords work
 and i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for they have done what was needed to make your work complete
 for they gave comfort to my spirit and to yours for which cause give respect to such people
 the churches of asia send their love to you so do aquila and prisca with the church which is in their house
 all the brothers send their love to you give one another a holy kiss
 i paul send you these words of love in my writing
 if any man has not love for the lord let him be cursed maran atha  our lord comes 
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
 my love be with you all in christ jesus so be it
 and when i came to you my brothers i did not come with wise words of knowledge putting before you the secret of god
 for i had made the decision to have knowledge of nothing among you but only of jesus christ on the cross
 and i was with you without strength in fear and in doubt
 and in my preaching there were no honeyed words of wisdom but i was dependent on the power of the spirit to make it clear to you
 so that your faith might be based not on mans wisdom but on the power of god
 but still we have wisdom for those who are complete in knowledge though not the wisdom of this world and not of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing
 but we give the news of the secret wisdom of god which he had kept in store before the world came into existence for our glory
 of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge for if they had they would not have put the lord of glory on the cross
 but as it says in the holy writings things which the eye saw not and which had not come to the ears or into the heart of man such things as god has made ready for those who have love for him
 but god has given us the revelation of these things through his spirit for the spirit makes search into all things even the deep things of god
 for who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him in the same way no one has knowledge of the things of god but the spirit of god
 but we have not the spirit of the world but the spirit which comes from god so that we may have knowledge of the things which are freely given to us by god
 and these are the things which we say not in the language of mans wisdom but in words given to us by the spirit judging the things of the spirit by the help of the spirit
 for the natural man is not able to take in the things of the spirit of god for they seem foolish to him and he is not able to have knowledge of them because such knowledge comes only through the spirit
 but he who has the spirit though judging all things is himself judged by no one
 for who has knowledge of the mind of the lord so as to be his teacher but we have the mind of christ
 and the teaching i gave you my brothers was such as i was able to give not to those who have the spirit but to those who are still in the flesh even to children in christ
 i gave you milk and not meat because you were then unable to take it and even now you are not able
 because you are still in the flesh for when there is envy and division among you are you not still walking after the way of the flesh even as natural men
 for when one says i am of paul and another says i am of apollos are you not talking like natural men
 what then is apollos and what is paul they are but servants who gave you the good news as god gave it to them
 i did the planting apollos did the watering but god gave the increase
 so then the planter is nothing and the waterer is nothing but god who gives the increase
 now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work
 for we are workers with god you are gods planting gods building
 in the measure of the grace given to me i as a wise master builder have put the base in position and another goes on building on it but let every man take care what he puts on it
 for there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down which is jesus christ
 but on the base a man may put gold silver stones of great price wood dry grass cut stems
 every mans work will be made clear in that day because it will be tested by fire and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every mans work
 if any mans work comes through the test he will have a reward
 if the fire puts an end to any mans work it will be his loss but he will get salvation himself though as by fire
 do you not see that you are gods holy house and that the spirit of god has his place in you
 if anyone makes the house of god unclean god will put an end to him for the house of god is holy and you are his house
 let no man have a false idea if any man seems to himself to be wise among you let him become foolish so that he may be wise
 for the wisdom of this world is foolish before god as it is said in the holy writings he who takes the wise in their secret designs
 and again the lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise that they are nothing
 so let no one take pride in men for all things are yours
 paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours
 and you are christs and christ is gods
 let us be judged as servants of christ and as those who are responsible for the secret things of god
 and it is right for such servants to be safe persons
 but it is a small thing to me that i am judged by you or by mans judging i am not even a judge of myself
 for i am not conscious of any wrong in myself but this does not make me clear for it is the lord who is my judge
 for this reason let there be no judging before the time till the lord comes who will make clear the secret things of the dark and the designs of the heart and then will every man have his praise from god
 my brothers it is because of you that i have taken apollos and myself as examples of these things so that in us you might see that it is not wise to go farther than what is in the holy writings so that no one of you may be lifted up against his brother
 for who made you better than your brother or what have you that has not been given to you but if it has been given to you what cause have you for pride as if it had not been given to you
 for even now you are full even now you have wealth you have been made kings without us truly i would be glad if you were kings so that we might be kings with you
 for it seems to me that god has put us the apostles last of all as men whose fate is death for we are put on view to the world and to angels and to men
 we are made to seem foolish for christ but you are wise in christ we are feeble but you are strong you have glory but we have shame
 even to this hour we are without food drink and clothing we are given blows and have no certain resting place
 and with our hands we do the hardest work when they give us curses we give blessings when we undergo punishment we take it quietly
 when evil things are said about us we give gentle answers we are made as the unclean things of the world as that for which no one has any use even till now
 i am not saying these things to put you to shame but so that as my dear children you may see what is right
 for even if you had ten thousand teachers in christ you have not more than one father for in christ jesus i have given birth to you through the good news
 so my desire is that you take me as your example
 for this cause i have sent timothy to you who is my dear and true child in the lord he will make clear to you my ways in christ even as i am teaching everywhere in every church
 now some are full of pride as if i was not coming to you
 but i will come to you in a short time if it is pleasing to the lord and i will take note not of the word of those who are full of pride but of the power
 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power
 what is your desire is my coming to be with punishment or is it to be in love and a gentle spirit
 it is said in fact that there is among you a sin of the flesh such as is not seen even among the gentiles that one of you has his fathers wife
 and in place of feeling sorrow you are pleased with yourselves so that he who has done this thing has not been sent away from among you
 for i myself being present in spirit though not in body have come to a decision about him who has done this thing
 in the name of our lord jesus when you have come together with my spirit with the power of our lord jesus
 that this man is to be handed over to satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his spirit may have forgiveness in the day of the lord jesus
 this pride of yours is not good do you not see that a little leaven makes a change in all the mass
 take away then the old leaven so that you may be a new mass even as you are without leaven for christ has been put to death as our passover
 let us then keep the feast not with old leaven and not with the leaven of evil thoughts and acts but with the unleavened bread of true thoughts and right feelings
 in my letter i said to you that you were not to keep company with those who go after the desires of the flesh
 but i had not in mind the sinners who are outside the church or those who have a desire for and take the property of others or those who give worship to images for it is not possible to keep away from such people without going out of the world completely
 but the sense of my letter was that if a brother had the name of being one who went after the desires of the flesh or had the desire for other peoples property or was in the way of using violent language or being the worse for drink or took by force what was not his you might not keep company with such a one or take food with him
 for it is no business of mine to be judging those who are outside but it is yours to be judging those who are among you
 as for those who are outside god is their judge so put away the evil man from among you
 how is it that if any one of you has a cause at law against another he takes it before a gentile judge and not before the saints
 is it not certain that the saints will be the judges of the world if then the world will be judged by you are you unable to give a decision about the smallest things
 is it not certain that we are to be the judges of angels how much more then of the things of this life
 if then there are questions to be judged in connection with the things of this life why do you put them in the hands of those who have no position in the church
 i say this to put you to shame is there not among you one wise man who may be able to give a decision between his brothers
 but a brother who has a cause at law against another takes it before gentile judges
 more than this it is not to your credit to have causes at law with one another at all why not put up with wrong why not undergo loss
 so far from doing this you yourselves do wrong and take your brothers property
 have you not knowledge that evil doers will have no part in the kingdom of god have no false ideas about this no one who goes after the desires of the flesh or gives worship to images or is untrue when married or is less than a man or makes a wrong use of men
 or is a thief or the worse for drink or makes use of strong language or takes by force what is not his will have any part in the kingdom of god
 and such were some of you but you have been washed you have been made holy you have been given righteousness in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god
 i am free to do all things but not all things are wise i am free to do all things but i will not let myself come under the power of any
 food is for the stomach and the stomach for food and god will put an end to them together but the body is not for the desires of the flesh but for the lord and the lord for the body
 and god who made the lord jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us by his power
 do you not see that your bodies are part of the body of christ how then may i take what is a part of the body of christ and make it a part of the body of a loose woman such a thing may not be
 or do you not see that he who is joined to a loose woman is one body with her for god has said the two of them will become one flesh
 but he who is united to the lord is one spirit
 keep away from the desires of the flesh every sin which a man does is outside of the body but he who goes after the desires of the flesh does evil to his body
 or are you not conscious that your body is a house for the holy spirit which is in you and which has been given to you by god and you are not the owners of yourselves
 for a payment has been made for you let god be honoured in your body
 now as to the things in your letter to me it is good for a man to have nothing to do with a woman
 but because of the desires of the flesh let every man have his wife and every woman her husband
 let the husband give to the wife what is right and let the wife do the same to the husband
 the wife has not power over her body but the husband and in the same way the husband has not power over his body but the wife
 do not keep back from one another what is right but only for a short time and by agreement so that you may give yourselves to prayer and come together again so that satan may not get the better of you through your loss of self control
 but this i say as my opinion and not as an order of the lord
 it is my desire that all men might be even as i am but every man has the power of his special way of life given him by god one in this way and one in that
 but i say to the unmarried and to the widows it is good for them to be even as i am
 but if they have not self control let them get married for married life is better than the burning of desire
 but to the married i give orders though not i but the lord that the wife may not go away from her husband
  or if she goes away from him let her keep unmarried or be united to her husband again  and that the husband may not go away from his wife
 but to the rest i say and not the lord if a brother has a wife who is not a christian and it is her desire to go on living with him let him not go away from her
 and if a woman has a husband who is not a christian and it is his desire to go on living with her let her not go away from her husband
 for the husband who has not faith is made holy through his christian wife and the wife who is not a christian is made holy through the brother if not your children would be unholy but now are they holy
 but if the one who is not a christian has a desire to go away let it be so the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other but it is gods pleasure that we may be at peace with one another
 for how may you be certain o wife that you will not be the cause of salvation to your husband or you o husband that you may not do the same for your wife
 only as the lord has given to a man and as is the purpose of god for him so let him go on living and these are my orders for all the churches
 if any man who is a christian has had circumcision let him keep so and if any man who is a christian has not had circumcision let him make no change
 circumcision is nothing and its opposite is nothing but only doing the orders of god is of value
 let every man keep the position in which he has been placed by god
 if you were a servant when you became a christian let it not be a grief to you but if you have a chance to become free make use of it
 for he who was a servant when he became a christian is the lords free man and he who was free when he became a christian is the lords servant
 it is the lord who has made payment for you be not servants of men
 my brothers let every man keep in that condition which is the purpose of god for him
 now about virgins i have no orders from the lord but i give my opinion as one to whom the lord has given mercy to be true to him
 in my opinion then because of the present trouble it is good for a man to keep as he is
 if you are married to a wife make no attempt to get free from her if you are free from a wife do not take a wife
 if you get married it is not a sin and if an unmarried woman gets married it is not a sin but those who do so will have trouble in the flesh but i will not be hard on you
 but i say this my brothers the time is short and from now it will be wise for those who have wives to be as if they had them not
 and for those who are in sorrow to give no signs of it and for those who are glad to give no signs of joy and for those who are getting property to be as if they had nothing
 and for those who make use of the world not to be using it fully for this worlds way of life will quickly come to an end
 but it is my desire for you to be free from cares the unmarried man gives his mind to the things of the lord how he may give pleasure to the lord
 but the married man gives his attention to the things of this world how he may give pleasure to his wife
 and the wife is not the same as the virgin the virgin gives her mind to the things of the lord so that she may be holy in body and in spirit but the married woman takes thought for the things of the world how she may give pleasure to her husband
 now i say this for your profit not to make things hard for you but because of what is right and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the lord
 but if in any mans opinion he is not doing what is right for his virgin if she is past her best years and there is need for it let him do what seems right to him it is no sin let them be married
 but the man who is strong in mind and purpose who is not forced but has control over his desires does well if he comes to the decision to keep her a virgin
 so then he who gets married to his virgin does well and he who keeps her unmarried does better
 it is right for a wife to be with her husband as long as he is living but when her husband is dead she is free to be married to another but only to a christian
 but it will be better for her to keep as she is in my opinion and it seems to me that i have the spirit of god
 now about things offered to images we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge knowledge gives pride but love gives true strength
 if anyone seems to himself to have knowledge so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything
 but if anyone has love for god god has knowledge of him
 so then as to the question of taking food offered to images we are certain that an image is nothing in the world and that there is no god but one
 for though there are those who have the name of gods in heaven or on earth as there are a number of gods and a number of lords
 there is for us only one god the father of whom are all things and we are for him and one lord jesus christ through whom are all things and we have our being through him
 still all men have not that knowledge but some being used till now to the image are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image and because they are not strong in the faith their minds are troubled
 but gods approval of us is not based on the food we take if we do not take it we are no worse for it and if we take it we are no better
 but take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble
 for if a man sees you who have knowledge taking food as a guest in the house of an image will it not give him if he is feeble the idea that he may take food offered to images
 and so through your knowledge you are the cause of destruction to your brother for whom christ underwent death
 and in this way doing evil to the brothers and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble you are sinning against christ
 for this reason if food is a cause of trouble to my brother i will give up taking meat for ever so that i may not be a cause of trouble to my brother
 am i not free am i not an apostle have i not seen jesus our lord are you not my work in the lord
 if to others i am not an apostle at least i am one to you for the fact that you are christians is the sign that i am an apostle
 my answer to those who are judging me is this
 have we no right to take food and drink
 have we no right to take about with us a christian wife like the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the lord and cephas
 or i only and barnabas have we no right to take a rest from work
 who ever goes to war without looking to someone to be responsible for his payment who puts in vines and does not take the fruit of them or who takes care of sheep without drinking of their milk
 am i talking as a man does not the law say the same
 for it says in the law of moses it is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it is it for the oxen that god is giving orders
 or has he us in mind yes it was said for us because it is right for the ploughman to do his ploughing in hope and for him who is crushing the grain to do his work hoping for a part in the fruits of it
 if we have been planting the things of the spirit for you does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world
 if others have a part in this right over you have we not even more but we did not make use of our right so that we might put nothing in the way of the good news of christ
 do you not see that the servants of the holy things get their living from the temple and the servants of the altar have their part in the food which is offered on the altar
 even so did the lord give orders that the preachers of the good news might get their living from the good news
 but i have not made use of any of these things and i am not writing this in the hope that it may be so for me for it would be better for me to undergo death than for any man to make this pride of mine of no effect
 for if i am a preacher of the good news i have no cause for pride in this because i am forced to do so for a curse is on me if i do not
 but if i do it gladly i have a reward and if not i am under orders to do it
 what then is my reward this that when i am giving the good news i may give it without payment not making use of my rights as a preacher of the good news
 for though i was free from all men i made myself a servant to all so that more might have salvation
 and to the jews i was as a jew so that i might give the good news to them to those under the law i was the same not as being myself under the law but so that i might give the good news to those under the law
 to those without the law i was as one without the law not as being without law to god but as under law to christ so that i might give the good news to those without the law
 to the feeble i was as one who is feeble so that they might have salvation i have been all things to all men so that some at least might have salvation
 and i do all things for the cause of the good news so that i may have a part in it
 do you not see that in a running competition all take part but only one gets the reward so let your minds be fixed on the reward
 and every man who takes part in the sports has self control in all things now they do it to get a crown which is of this world but we for an eternal crown
 so then i am running not uncertainly so i am fighting not as one who gives blows in the air
 but i give blows to my body and keep it under control for fear that after having given the good news to others i myself might not have gods approval
 paul and silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to you and peace
 we give praise to god at all times for you keeping you in memory in our prayers
 having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our lord jesus christ before our god and father
 being conscious my brothers dear to god that you have been marked out by gods purpose
 because our good news came to you not in word only but in power and in the holy spirit so that you were completely certain of it even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you
 and you took us and the lord as your example after the word had come to you in much trouble with joy in the holy spirit
 so that you became an example to all those who have faith in christ in macedonia and achaia
 for not only was the word of the lord sounding out from you in macedonia and achaia but in every place your faith in god is made clear so that we have no need to say anything
 for they themselves give the news of how we came among you and how you were turned from images to god to the worship of a true and living god
 waiting for his son from heaven who came back from the dead even jesus our saviour from the wrath to come
 for you yourselves brothers are conscious that our coming among you was not without effect
 but after we had first undergone much pain and been cruelly attacked as you saw at philippi by the help of god we gave you the good news without fear though everything was against us
 for our witness does not come from error or from an unclean heart or from deceit
 but even as the good news was given to us by the approval of god so we give it out not as pleasing men but god by whom our hearts are tested
 for it is common knowledge among you that we never made use of smooth sounding false words and god is witness that at no time were we secretly desiring profit for ourselves
 or looking for glory from men from you or from others when we might have made ourselves a care to you as apostles of christ
 but we were gentle among you like a woman caring for her little ones
 even so being full of loving desire for you we took delight in giving you not only gods good news but even our lives because you were dear to us
 for you have the memory my brothers of our trouble and care how working night and day so that we might not be a trouble to any of you we gave you the good news of god
 you are witnesses with god how holy and upright and free from all evil was our way of life among you who have faith
 even as you saw how like a father with his children we were teaching and comforting you all and giving witness
 so that your lives might be pleasing to god who has given you a part in his kingdom and his glory
 and for this cause we still give praise to god that when the word came to your ears through us you took it not as the word of man but as it truly is the word of god which has living power in you who have faith
 for you my brothers took as your examples the churches of god which are in judaea in christ jesus because you underwent the same things from your countrymen as they did from the jews
 who put to death the lord jesus and the prophets violently driving us out who are unpleasing to god and against all men
 who to make the measure of their sins complete kept us from giving the word of salvation to the gentiles but the wrath of god is about to come on them in the fullest degree
 but we my brothers being away from you for a short time in body but not in heart had all the more desire to see your face
 for which reason we made attempts to come to you even i paul once and again but satan kept us from coming
 for what is our hope or joy or crown of glory are not even you before our lord jesus at his coming
 for you are our glory and our joy
 at last our desire to have news of you was so strong that while we ourselves were waiting at athens
 we sent timothy our brother and gods servant in the good news of christ to give you strength and comfort in your faith
 so that no man might be moved by these troubles because you see that these things are part of gods purpose for us
 and when we were with you we said to you that trouble was before us and so it came about as you see
 for this reason when i was no longer able to keep quiet i sent to get news of your faith fearing that you might be tested by the evil one and that our work might come to nothing
 but now that timothy has come to us from you and has given us good news of your faith and love and that you have happy memories of us desiring greatly to see us even as we do to see you
 for this cause brothers in all our trouble and grief we were comforted about you because of your faith
 for it is life to us if you keep your faith in the lord unchanged
 for how great is the praise which we give to god for you and how great the joy with which we are glad because of you before our god
 night and day requesting god again and again that we may see your face and make your faith complete
 now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus make a way for us to come to you
 and the lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men even as our love to you
 so that your hearts may be strong and free from all sin before our god and father at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints
 and last of all the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the lord jesus is this that as we made clear to you what sort of behaviour is pleasing to god as in fact you are doing now so you will go on in these ways but more and more
 because you have in mind the orders we gave you through the lord jesus
 for the purpose of god for you is this that you may be holy and may keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh
 so that every one of you may keep his body holy and in honour
 not in the passion of evil desires like the gentiles who have no knowledge of god
 and that no man may make attempts to get the better of his brother in business for the lord is the judge in all these things as we said to you before and gave witness
 because it is gods purpose that our way of life may be not unclean but holy
 whoever then goes against this word goes against not man but god who gives his holy spirit to you
 but about loving the brothers there is no need for me to say anything to you in this letter for you have the teaching of god that love for one another is right and necessary
 and truly you are lovers of all the brothers in macedonia but it is our desire that your love may be increased still more
 and that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business working with your hands as we gave you orders
 that you may be respected by those who are outside and may have need of nothing
 but it is our desire brothers that you may be certain about those who are sleeping so that you may have no need for sorrow as others have who are without hope
 for if we have faith that jesus underwent death and came back again even so those who are sleeping will come again with him by gods power
 for this we say to you by the word of the lord that we who are still living at the coming of the lord will not go before those who are sleeping
 because the lord himself will come down from heaven with a word of authority with the voice of the chief angel with the sound of a horn and the dead in christ will come to life first
 then we who are still living will be taken up together with them into the clouds to see the lord in the air and so will we be for ever with the lord
 so then give comfort to one another with these words
 but about the times and their order my brothers there is no need for me to say anything to you
 for you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the lord will come like a thief in the night
 when they say there is peace and no danger then sudden destruction will come on them as birth pains on a woman with child and they will not be able to get away from it
 but you my brothers are not in the dark for that day to overtake you like a thief
 for you are all sons of light and of the day we are not of the night or of the dark
 so then let us not take our rest as the others do but let us be self controlled and awake
 for those who are sleeping do so in the night and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night
 but let us who are of the day be serious putting on the breastplate of faith and love and on our heads the hope of salvation
 for gods purpose for us is not wrath but salvation through our lord jesus christ
 who was put to death for us so that awake or sleeping we may have a part in his life
 so then go on comforting and building up one another as you have been doing
 but we make this request to you my brothers give attention to those who are working among you who are over you in the lord to keep order among you
 and have a high opinion of them in love because of their work be at peace among yourselves
 and our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered giving comfort to the feeble hearted supporting those with little strength and putting up with much from all
 let no one give evil for evil but ever go after what is good for one another and for all
 have joy at all times
 keep on with your prayers
 in everything give praise for this is the purpose of god in christ jesus for you
 do not put out the light of the spirit
 do not make little of the words of the prophets
 let all things be tested keep to what is good
 keep from every form of evil
 and may the god of peace himself make you holy in every way and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our lord jesus christ
 god by whom you have been marked out in his purpose is unchanging and will make it complete
 brothers keep us in mind in your prayers
 give all the brothers a holy kiss
 i give orders in the name of the lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the order of god our saviour and christ jesus our hope
 to timothy my true child in the faith grace mercy peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
 it was my desire when i went on into macedonia that you might make a stop at ephesus to give orders to certain men not to put forward a different teaching
 or to give attention to stories and long lists of generations from which come questionings and doubts in place of gods ordered way of life which is in faith
 but the effect of the order is love coming from a clean heart and a knowledge of what is right and true faith
 from which some have been turned away giving themselves to foolish talking
 desiring to be teachers of the law though they have no knowledge of what they say or of the statements which they make so certainly
 we are conscious that the law is good if a man makes a right use of it
 with the knowledge that the law is made not for the upright man but for those who have no respect for law and order for evil men and sinners for the unholy and those who have no religion for those who put their fathers or mothers to death for takers of life
 for those who go after loose women for those with unnatural desires for those who take men prisoners who make false statements and false oaths and those who do any other things against the right teaching
 which may be seen in the good news of the glory of the great god which was given into my care
 i give praise to him who gave me power christ jesus our lord because he took me to be true making me his servant
 though i had said violent words against god and done cruel acts causing great trouble but i was given mercy because i did it without knowledge not having faith
 and the grace of our lord was very great with faith and love which is in christ jesus
 it is a true saying in which all may put their faith that christ jesus came into the world to give salvation to sinners of whom i am the chief
 but for this reason i was given mercy so that in me the chief of sinners jesus christ might make clear all his mercy as an example to those who in the future would have faith in him to eternal life
 now to the king eternal ever living unseen the only god be honour and glory for ever and ever so be it
 this order i give to you timothy my son in harmony with the words of the prophets about you so that by them you may be strong fighting the good fight
 keeping faith and being conscious of well doing for some by not doing these things have gone wrong in relation to the faith
 such are hymenaeus and alexander whom i have given up to satan so that they may say no more evil words against god
 my desire is first of all that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men
 for kings and all those in authority so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of god and serious behaviour
 this is good and pleasing in the eyes of god our saviour
 whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true
 for there is one god and one peacemaker between god and men the man christ jesus
 who gave himself as an offering for all witness of which was to be given at the right time
 and of this i became a preacher and an apostle  what i say is true not false  and a teacher of the gentiles in the true faith
 it is my desire then that in every place men may give themselves to prayer lifting up holy hands without wrath or argument
 and that women may be dressed in simple clothing with a quiet and serious air not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price
 but clothed with good works as is right for women who are living in the fear of god
 let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority
 in my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher or to have rule over a man but to be quiet
 for adam was first formed then eve
 and adam was not taken by deceit but the woman being tricked became a wrongdoer
 but if they go on in faith and love and holy self control she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth
 this is a true saying a man desiring the position of a bishop has a desire for a good work
 the bishop then is to be a man of good name the husband of one wife self controlled serious minded having respect for order opening his house freely to guests a ready teacher
 not quickly moved to wrath or blows but gentle no fighter no lover of money
 ruling his house well having his children under control with all serious behaviour
  for if a man has not the art of ruling his house how will he take care of the church of god 
 not one newly taken into the church for fear that through his high opinion of himself he may come into the same sin as the evil one
 and he is to have a good name among those outside the church so that nothing may be said against him and he may not be taken by the designs of the evil one
 deacons in the same way are to be serious in their behaviour not false in word not given to taking much wine or greatly desiring the wealth of this world
 keeping the secret of the faith in a heart free from sin
 and let these first be put to the test then let them become deacons if there is nothing against them
 women are to be serious in behaviour saying no evil of others controlling themselves true in all things
 let deacons be husbands of one wife ruling their children and their houses well
 for those who have done good work as deacons get for themselves a good position and become free from fear in the faith which is in christ jesus
 i am writing these things to you though i am hoping to come to you before long
 but if i am long in coming this will make clear to you what behaviour is right for men in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and base of what is true
 and without argument great is the secret of religion he who was seen in the flesh who was given gods approval in the spirit was seen by the angels of whom the good news was given among the nations in whom the world had faith who was taken up in glory
 but the spirit says clearly that in later times some will be turned away from the faith giving their minds to spirits of deceit and the teachings of evil spirits
 through the false ways of men whose words are untrue whose hearts are burned as with a heated iron
 who keep men from being married and from taking food which god made to be taken with praise by those who have faith and true knowledge
 because everything which god has made is good and nothing is evil if it is taken with praise
 for it is made holy by the word of god and by prayer
 if you keep these things before the minds of the brothers you will be a good servant of christ jesus trained in the words of the faith and of the right teaching which has been your guide
 but have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories give yourself training in religion
 for the training of the body is of profit for a little but religion is of profit in every way giving hope for the life which now is and for that which is to come
 this is a true saying in which all may put their faith
 and this is the purpose of all our work and our fighting because our hope is in the living god who is the saviour of all men and specially of those who have faith
 let these be your orders and your teaching
 let no one make little of you because you are young but be an example to the church in word in behaviour in love in faith in holy living
 till i come give attention to the reading of the holy writings to comforting the saints and to teaching
 make use of that grace in you which was given to you by the word of the prophets when the rulers of the church put their hands on you
 have a care for these things give yourself to them with all your heart so that all may see how you go forward
 give attention to yourself and your teaching go on in these things for in doing so you will get salvation for yourself and for those who give hearing to you
 do not say sharp words to one who has authority in the church but let your talk be as to a father and to the younger men as to brothers
 to the older women as to mothers to the younger as to sisters with a clean heart
 give honour to widows who are truly widows
 but if any widow has children or childrens children let these see that it is right to take care of their family and their fathers and mothers for this is pleasing in the eyes of god
 now she who is truly a widow and without family puts her hope in god giving herself to prayer day and night
 but she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she is living
 give orders to this effect so that no evil may be said of anyone
 if anyone has no care for his family and those in his house he is false to the faith and is worse than one who has no faith
 let no woman be numbered among the widows who is under sixty years old and only if she has been the wife of one man
 and if witness is given of her good works if she has had the care of children if she has been kind to travellers washing the feet of the saints helping those who are in trouble giving herself to good works
 but to the younger widows say no for when their love is turned away from christ they have a desire to be married
 and they are judged because they have been false to their first faith
 and they get into the way of doing no work going about from house to house and not only doing no work but talking foolishly being over interested in the business of others saying things which they have no right to say
 so it is my desire that the younger widows may be married and have children controlling their families and giving the evil one no chance to say anything against them
 for even now some are turned away to satan
 if any woman of the faith has relations who are widows let her give them help so that the care of them does not come on the church and so it may give help to those who are truly widowed
 let rulers whose rule is good be honoured twice over specially those whose work is preaching and teaching
 for the writings say it is not right to keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it and the worker has a right to his reward
 do not take as true any statement made against one in authority but only if two or three give witness to it
 say sharp words to sinners when all are present so that the rest may be in fear
 i give you orders before god and christ jesus and the angels of gods selection to keep these orders without giving thought to one side more than another
 do not put hands on any man without thought and have no part in other mens sins keep yourself clean
 do not take only water as your drink but take a little wine for the good of your stomach and because you are frequently ill
 the sins of some men are clearly seen going before them to be judged but with others their sins go after them
 in the same way there are good works which are clearly seen and those which are not so may not be kept secret
 let all who are servants under the yoke give all honour to their masters so that no evil may be said against the name of god and his teaching
 and let those whose masters are of the faith have respect for them because they are brothers working for them the more readily because those who take part in the good work are of the faith and are dear give orders and teaching about these things
 if any man gives different teaching not in agreement with the true words of our lord jesus christ and with the teaching which is in agreement with true religion
 he has an over high opinion of himself being without knowledge having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words from which come envy fighting cruel words evil thoughts
 bitter talk of men who being evil in mind and dead to what is true take the faith to be a way of making profit
 but true faith with peace of mind is of great profit
 for we came into the world with nothing and we are not able to take anything out
 but if we have food and a roof over us let that be enough
 but those who have a desire for wealth are falling into danger and are taken as in a net by a number of foolish and damaging desires through which men are overtaken by death and destruction
 for the love of money is a root of all evil and some whose hearts were fixed on it have been turned away from the faith and been wounded with unnumbered sorrows
 but you o man of god keep yourself from these things and go after righteousness religion faith love a quiet mind gentle behaviour
 be fighting the good fight of the faith take for yourself the life eternal for which you were marked out and of which you gave witness in the eyes of all
 i give you orders before god the giver of life and christ jesus who before pontius pilate gave witness to the faith
 to keep the word untouched by evil clear from all shame till the revelation of our lord jesus christ
 which at the right time he will make clear who is the eternal and only ruler king of kings and lord of lords
 who only has life for ever living in light to which no man may come near whom no man has seen or is able to see to whom be honour and power for ever so be it
 give orders to those who have money and goods in this life not to be lifted up in their minds or to put their hope in the uncertain chances of wealth but in god who gives us in full measure all things for our use
 and to do good having wealth in good works being quick to give taking part with one another
 making ready for themselves a safe place for the time to come so that the true life may be theirs
 o timothy take good care of that which is given to you turning away from the wrong and foolish talk and arguments of that knowledge which is falsely so named
 through which some who gave their minds to it have been turned away from the faith grace be with you
 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the saints who are living in pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia
 who through the purpose of god have been made holy by the spirit disciples of jesus made clean by his blood may you have grace and peace in full measure
 praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ who through his great mercy has given us a new birth and a living hope by the coming again of jesus christ from the dead
 and a heritage fair holy and for ever new waiting in heaven for you
 who by the power of god are kept through faith for that salvation which will be seen at the last day
 you have cause for great joy in this though it may have been necessary for you to be troubled for a little time being tested in all sorts of ways
 so that the true metal of your faith being of much greater value than gold  which though it comes to an end is tested by fire  may come to light in praise and glory and honour at the revelation of jesus christ
 to whom your love is given though you have not seen him and the faith which you have in him though you do not see him now gives you joy greater than words and full of glory
 for so you have the true end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
 for the prophets who gave the news of the grace which would come to you made search with all care for knowledge of this salvation
 attempting to see what sort of time the spirit of christ which was in them was pointing to when it gave witness to the pains which christ would undergo and the glories which would come after them
 and it was made clear to those prophets that they were gods servants not for themselves but for you to give you word of the things which have now come to your ears from the preachers of the good news through the holy spirit sent down from heaven things which even angels have a desire to see
 so make your minds ready and keep on the watch hoping with all your power for the grace which is to come to you at the revelation of jesus christ
 like children ruled by god do not go back to the old desires of the time when you were without knowledge
 but be holy in every detail of your lives as he whose servants you are is holy
 because it has been said in the writings you are to be holy for i am holy
 and if you give the name of father to him who judging every man by his acts has no respect for a mans position then go in fear while you are on this earth
 being conscious that you have been made free from that foolish way of life which was your heritage from your fathers not through a payment of things like silver or gold which come to destruction
 but through holy blood like that of a clean and unmarked lamb even the blood of christ
 who was marked out by god before the making of the world but was caused to be seen in these last times for you
 who through him have faith in god who took him up again from the dead into glory so that your faith and hope might be in god
 and as you have made your souls clean being ruled by what is true and loving one another without deceit see that your love is warm and from the heart
 because you have had a new birth not from the seed of man but from eternal seed through the word of a living and unchanging god
 for it is said all flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of the grass the grass becomes dry and the flower dead
 but the word of the lord is eternal and this is the word of the good news which was given to you
 so putting away all wrongdoing and all tricks and deceits and envies and evil talk
 be full of desire for the true milk of the word as babies at their mothers breasts so that you may go on to salvation
 if you have had a taste of the grace of the lord
 to whom you come as to a living stone not honoured by men but of great and special value to god
 you as living stones are being made into a house of the spirit a holy order of priests making those offerings of the spirit which are pleasing to god through jesus christ
 because it is said in the writings see i am placing a keystone in zion of great and special value and the man who has faith in him will not be put to shame
 and the value is for you who have faith but it is said for those without faith the very stone which the builders put on one side was made the chief stone of the building
 and a stone of falling a rock of trouble the word is the cause of their fall because they go against it and this was the purpose of god
 but you are a special people a holy nation priests and kings a people given up completely to god so that you may make clear the virtues of him who took you out of the dark into the light of heaven
 in the past you were not a people but now you are the people of god then there was no mercy for you but now mercy has been given to you
 my loved ones i make this request with all my heart that as those for whom this world is a strange country you will keep yourselves from the desires of the flesh which make war against the soul
 being of good behaviour among the gentiles so that though they say now that you are evil doers they may see your good works and give glory to god when he comes to be their judge
 keep all the laws of men because of the lord those of the king who is over all
 and those of the rulers who are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of those who do well
 because it is gods pleasure that foolish and narrow minded men may be put to shame by your good behaviour
 as those who are free not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing but living as the servants of god
 have respect for all loving the brothers fearing god honouring the king
 servants take orders from your masters with all respect not only if they are good and gentle but even if they are bad humoured
 for it is a sign of grace if a man desiring to do right in the eyes of god undergoes pain as punishment for something which he has not done
 what credit is it if when you have done evil you take your punishment quietly but if you are given punishment for doing right and take it quietly this is pleasing to god
 this is gods purpose for you because jesus himself underwent punishment for you giving you an example so that you might go in his footsteps
 who did no evil and there was no deceit in his mouth
 to sharp words he gave no sharp answer when he was undergoing pain no angry word came from his lips but he put himself into the hands of the judge of righteousness
 he took our sins on himself giving his body to be nailed on the tree so that we being dead to sin might have a new life in righteousness and by his wounds we have been made well
 because like sheep you had gone out of the way but now you have come back to him who keeps watch over your souls
 wives be ruled by your husbands so that even if some of them give no attention to the word their hearts may be changed by the behaviour of their wives
 when they see your holy behaviour in the fear of god
 do not let your ornaments be those of the body such as dressing of the hair or putting on of jewels of gold or fair clothing
 but let them be those of the unseen man of the heart the ever shining ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit which is of great price in the eyes of god
 and these were the ornaments of the holy women of the past whose hope was in god being ruled by their husbands
 as sarah was ruled by abraham naming him lord whose children you are if you do well and are not put in fear by any danger
 and you husbands give thought to your way of life with your wives giving honour to the woman who is the feebler vessel but who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life so that you may not be kept from prayer
 last of all see that you are all in agreement feeling for one another loving one another like brothers full of pity without pride
 not giving back evil for evil or curse for curse but in place of cursing blessing because this is the purpose of god for you that you may have a heritage of blessing
 for it is said let the man who has a love of life desiring to see good days keep his tongue from evil and his lips from words of deceit
 and let him be turned from evil and do good searching for peace and going after it with all his heart
 for the eyes of the lord are on the upright and his ears are open to their prayers but the face of the lord is against those who do evil
 who will do you any damage if you keep your minds fixed on what is good
 but you are happy if you undergo pain because of righteousness have no part in their fear and do not be troubled
 but give honour to christ in your hearts as your lord and be ready at any time when you are questioned about the hope which is in you to give an answer in the fear of the lord and without pride
 being conscious that you have done no wrong so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as christians may be put to shame
 because if it is gods purpose for you to undergo pain it is better to do so for well doing than for evil doing
 because christ once went through pain for sins the upright one taking the place of sinners so that through him we might come back to god being put to death in the flesh but given life in the spirit
 by whom he went to the spirits in prison preaching to those
 who in the days of noah went against gods orders but god in his mercy kept back the punishment while noah got ready the ark in which a small number that is to say eight persons got salvation through water
 and baptism of which this is an image now gives you salvation not by washing clean the flesh but by making you free from the sense of sin before god through the coming again of jesus christ from the dead
 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers having been put under his rule
 so that as jesus was put to death in the flesh do you yourselves be of the same mind for the death of the flesh puts an end to sin
 so that you may give the rest of your lives in the flesh not to the desires of men but to the purpose of god
 because for long enough in times past we have been living after the way of the gentiles given up to the desires of the flesh to drinking and feasting and loose behaviour and unclean worship of images
 and they are wondering that you no longer go with them in this violent wasting of life and are saying evil things of you
 but they will have to give an account of themselves to him who is ready to be the judge of the living and the dead
 for this was the reason why the good news of jesus was given even to the dead so that they might be judged as men in the flesh but might be living before god in the spirit
 but the end of all things is near so be serious in your behaviour and keep on the watch with prayer
 and most of all be warm in your love for one another because in love there is forgiveness for sins without number
 keep open house for all with a glad heart
 making distribution among one another of whatever has been given to you like true servants of the unmeasured grace of god
 if anyone has anything to say let it be as the words of god if anyone has the desire to be the servant of others let him do it in the strength which is given by god so that in all things god may have the glory through jesus christ whose are the glory and the power for ever
 dear brothers do not be surprised as if it was something strange if your faith is tested as by fire
 but be glad that you are given a part in the pains of christ so that at the revelation of his glory you may have great joy
 if men say evil things of you because of the name of christ happy are you for the spirit of glory and of god is resting on you
 let no one among you undergo punishment as a taker of life or as a thief or as an evil doer or as one who is over interested in other mens business
 but if he undergoes punishment as a christian that is no shame to him let him give glory to god in this name
 for the time has come for the judging starting with the church of god but if it makes a start with us what will be the end of those who are not under the rule of god
 and if it is hard for even the good man to get salvation what chance has the man without religion or the sinner
 for this reason let those who by the purpose of god undergo punishment keep on in well doing and put their souls into the safe hands of their maker
 i who am myself one of the rulers of the church and a witness of the death of christ having my part in the coming glory send this serious request to the chief men among you
 keep watch over the flock of god which is in your care using your authority not as forced to do so but gladly and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind
 not as lords over gods heritage but making yourselves examples to the flock
 and at the coming of the chief keeper of the sheep you will be given the eternal crown of glory
 and in the same way let the younger men be ruled by the older ones let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants for god is a hater of pride but he gives grace to those who make themselves low
 for this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of god so that when the time comes you may be lifted up
 putting all your troubles on him for he takes care of you
 be serious and keep watch the evil one who is against you goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food
 do not give way to him but be strong in your faith in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles
 and after you have undergone pain for a little time the god of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through christ jesus will himself give you strength and support and make you complete in every good thing
 his is the power for ever so be it
 i have sent you this short letter by silvanus a true brother in my opinion comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of god keep to it
 she who is in babylon who has a part with you in the purpose of god sends you her love and so does my son mark
 give one another the kiss of love peace be to you all in christ
 simon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to those who with us have a part in the same holy faith in the righteousness of our god and saviour jesus christ
 may grace and peace ever be increasing in you in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
 because by his power he has given us everything necessary for life and righteousness through the knowledge of him who has been our guide by his glory and virtue
 and through this he has given us the hope of great rewards highly to be valued so that by them we might have our part in gods being and be made free from the destruction which is in the world through the desires of the flesh
 so for this very cause take every care joining virtue to faith and knowledge to virtue
 and self control to knowledge and a quiet mind to self control and fear of god to a quiet mind
 and love of the brothers to fear of god and to love of the brothers love itself
 for if you have these things in good measure they will make you fertile and full of fruit in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ
 for the man who has not these things is blind seeing only what is near having no memory of how he was made clean from his old sins
 for this reason my brothers take all the more care to make your selection and approval certain for if you do these things you will never have a fall
 for so the way will be open to you into the eternal kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
 for this reason i will be ready at all times to keep your memory of these things awake though you have the knowledge of them now and are well based in your present faith
 and it seems right to me as long as i am in this tent of flesh to keep your minds awake by working on your memory
 for i am conscious that in a short time i will have to put off this tent of flesh as our lord jesus christ has made clear to me
 and i will take every care so that you may have a clear memory of these things after my death
 for when we gave you news of the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ our teaching was not based on stories put together by art but we were eye witnesses of his glory
 for god the father gave him honour and glory when such a voice came to him out of the great glory saying this is my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 and this voice came from heaven even to our ears when we were with him on the holy mountain
 and so the words of the prophets are made more certain and it is well for you to give attention to them as to a light shining in a dark place till the dawn comes and the morning star is seen in your hearts
 being conscious in the first place that no man by himself may give a special sense to the words of the prophets
 for these words did not ever come through the impulse of men but the prophets had them from god being moved by the holy spirit
 but there were false prophets among the people as there will be false teachers among you who will secretly put forward wrong teachings for your destruction even turning away from the lord who gave himself for them whose destruction will come quickly and they themselves will be the cause of it
 and a great number will go with them in their evil ways through whom the true way will have a bad name
 and in their desire for profit they will come to you with words of deceit like traders doing business in souls whose punishment has been ready for a long time and their destruction is watching for them
 for if god did not have pity for the angels who did evil but sent them down into hell to be kept in chains of eternal night till they were judged
 and did not have mercy on the world which then was but only kept safe noah a preacher of righteousness with seven others when he let loose the waters over the world of the evil doers
 and sent destruction on sodom and gomorrah burning them up with fire as an example to those whose way of life might in the future be unpleasing to him
 and kept safe lot the upright man who was deeply troubled by the unclean life of the evil doers
  because the soul of that upright man living among them was pained from day to day by seeing and hearing their crimes 
 the lord is able to keep the upright safe in the time of testing and to keep evil doers under punishment till the day of judging
 but specially those who go after the unclean desires of the flesh and make sport of authority ready to take chances uncontrolled they have no fear of saying evil of those in high places
 though the angels who are greater in strength and power do not make use of violent language against them before the lord
 but these men like beasts without reason whose natural use is to be taken and put to death crying out against things of which they have no knowledge will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others
 for the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evil doing such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime they are like the marks of a disease like poisoned wounds among you feasting together with you in joy
 having eyes full of evil desire never having enough of sin turning feeble souls out of the true way they are children of cursing whose hearts are well used to bitter envy
 turning out of the true way they have gone wandering in error after the way of balaam the son of beor who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing
 but his wrongdoing was pointed out to him an ass talking with a mans voice put a stop to the error of the prophet
 these are fountains without water and mists before a driving storm for whom the eternal night is kept in store
 for with high sounding false words making use of the attraction of unclean desires of the flesh they get into their power those newly made free from those who are living in error
 saying that they will be free while they themselves are the servants of destruction because whatever gets the better of a man makes a servant of him
 for if after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again taken in the net and overcome their last condition is worse than their first
 for it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them after having knowledge of it
 they are an example of that true saying the dog has gone back to the food it had put out and the pig which had been washed to its rolling in the dirty earth
 my loved ones this is now my second letter to you and in this as in the first i am attempting to keep your true minds awake
 so that you may keep in mind the words of the holy prophets in the past and the law of the lord and saviour which was given to you by his apostles
 having first of all the knowledge that in the last days there will be men who ruled by their evil desires will make sport of holy things
 saying where is the hope of his coming from the death of the fathers till now everything has gone on as it was from the making of the world
 but in taking this view they put out of their minds the memory that in the old days there was a heaven and an earth lifted out of the water and circled by water by the word of god
 and that the world which then was came to an end through the overflowing of the waters
 but the present heaven and the present earth have been kept for destruction by fire which is waiting for them on the day of the judging and destruction of evil men
 but my loved ones keep in mind this one thing that with the lord one day is the same as a thousand years and a thousand years are no more than one day
 the lord is not slow in keeping his word as he seems to some but he is waiting in mercy for you not desiring the destruction of any but that all may be turned from their evil ways
 but the day of the lord will come like a thief and in that day the heavens will be rolled up with a great noise and the substance of the earth will be changed by violent heat and the world and everything in it will be burned up
 seeing then that all these things are coming to such an end what sort of persons is it right for you to be in all holy behaviour and righteousness
 looking for and truly desiring the coming of the day of god when the heavens will come to an end through fire and the substance of the earth will be changed by the great heat
 but having faith in his word we are looking for a new heaven and a new earth which will be the resting place of righteousness
 for this reason my loved ones as you are looking for these things take great care that when he comes you may be in peace before him free from sin and every evil thing
 and be certain that the long waiting of the lord is for salvation even as our brother paul has said in his letters to you from the wisdom which was given to him
 and as he said in all his letters which had to do with these things in which are some hard sayings so that like the rest of the holy writings they are twisted by those who are uncertain and without knowledge to the destruction of their souls
 for this reason my loved ones having knowledge of these things before they take place take care that you are not turned away by the error of the uncontrolled so falling from your true faith
 but be increased in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ may he have glory now and for ever so be it
 that which was from the first which has come to our ears and which we have seen with our eyes looking on it and touching it with our hands about the word of life
  and the life was made clear to us and we have seen it and are witnessing to it and giving you word of that eternal life which was with the father and was seen by us 
 we give you word of all we have seen and everything which has come to our ears so that you may be united with us and we are united with the father and with his son jesus christ
 and we are writing these things to you so that our joy may be made complete
 this is the word which came to us from him and which we give to you that god is light and in him there is nothing dark
 if we say we are joined to him and are walking still in the dark our words are false and our acts are untrue
 but if we are walking in the light as he is in the light we are all united with one another and the blood of jesus his son makes us clean from all sin
 if we say that we have no sin we are false to ourselves and there is nothing true in us
 if we say openly that we have done wrong he is upright and true to his word giving us forgiveness of sins and making us clean from all evil
 if we say that we have no sin we make him false and his word is not in us
 my little children i am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin and if any man is a sinner we have a friend and helper with the father jesus christ the upright one
 he is the offering for our sins and not for ours only but for all the world
 and by this we may be certain that we have knowledge of him if we keep his laws
 the man who says i have knowledge of him and does not keep his laws is false and there is nothing true in him
 but in every man who keeps his word the love of god is made complete by this we may be certain that we are in him
 he who says that he is living in him will do as he did
 my loved ones i do not give you a new law but an old law which you had from the first this old law is the word which came to your ears
 again i give you a new law which is true in him and in you for the night is near its end and the true light is even now shining out
 he who says that he is in the light and has hate in his heart for his brother is still in the dark
 he who has love for his brother is in the light and there is no cause of error in him
 but he who has hate for his brother is in the dark walking in the dark with no knowledge of where he is going unable to see because of the dark
 i am writing to you my children because you have forgiveness of sins through his name
 i am writing to you fathers because you have knowledge of him who was from the first i am writing to you young men because you have overcome the evil one i have sent a letter to you children because you have knowledge of the father
 i have sent a letter to you fathers because you have knowledge of him who was from the first i have sent a letter to you young men because you are strong and the word of god is in you and because you have overcome the evil one
 have no love for the world or for the things which are in the world if any man has love for the world the love of the father is not in him
 because everything in the world the desire of the flesh the desire of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world
 and the world and its desires is coming to an end but he who does gods pleasure is living for ever
 little children it is the last hour and as you were given word that the antichrist would come so now a number of antichrists have come to you and by this we are certain that it is the last hour
 they went out from us but they were not of us if they had been of us they would still be with us but they went out from us so that it might be made clear that they were not of us
 and you have the spirit from the holy one and you all have knowledge
 i have not sent you this letter because you have no knowledge of what is true but because you have knowledge and because that which is false has nothing in common with that which is true
 who is false but he who says that jesus is not the christ he is the antichrist who has no belief in the father or the son
 he who has no belief in the son has not the father he who makes clear his belief in the son has the father
 but as for you keep in your hearts the things which were made clear to you from the first if you keep these things in your hearts you will be kept in the father and the son
 and this is the hope which he gave you even eternal life
 i am writing these things to you about those whose purpose is that you may be turned out of the true way
 as for you the spirit which he gave you is still in you and you have no need of any teacher but as his spirit gives you teaching about all things and is true and not false so keep your hearts in him through the teaching which he has given you
 and now my children keep your hearts in him so that at his revelation we may have no fear or shame before him at his coming
 if you have knowledge that he is upright it is clear to you that everyone who does righteousness is his offspring
 see what great love the father has given us in naming us the children of god and such we are for this reason the world does not see who we are because it did not see who he was
 my loved ones now we are children of god and at present it is not clear what we are to be we are certain that at his revelation we will be like him for we will see him as he is
 and everyone who has this hope in him makes himself holy even as he is holy
 everyone who is a sinner goes against the law for sin is going against the law
 and you have knowledge that he came to take away sin and in him there is no sin
 anyone who is in him does no sin anyone who is a sinner has not seen him and has no knowledge of him
 my little children let no man take you out of the true way he who does righteousness is upright even as he is upright
 the sinner is a child of the evil one for the evil one has been a sinner from the first and the son of god was seen on earth so that he might put an end to the works of the evil one
 anyone who is a child of god does no sin because he still has gods seed in him he is not able to be a sinner because god is his father
 in this way it is clear who are the children of god and who are the children of the evil one anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother is not a child of god
 because this is the word which was given to you from the first that we are to have love for one another
 not being of the evil one like cain who put his brother to death and why did he put him to death because his works were evil and his brothers works were good
 do not be surprised my brothers if the world has no love for you
 we are conscious that we have come out of death into life because of our love for the brothers he who has no love is still in death
 anyone who has hate for his brother is a taker of life and you may be certain that no taker of life has eternal life in him
 in this we see what love is because he gave his life for us and it is right for us to give our lives for the brothers
 but if a man has this worlds goods and sees that his brother is in need and keeps his heart shut against his brother how is it possible for the love of god to be in him
 my little children do not let our love be in word and in tongue but let it be in act and in good faith
 in this way we may be certain that we are true and may give our heart comfort before him
 when our heart says that we have done wrong because god is greater than our heart and has knowledge of all things
 my loved ones if our heart does not say that we have done wrong we have no fear before him
 and he gives us all our requests because we keep his laws and do the things which are pleasing in his eyes
 and this is his law that we have faith in the name of his son jesus christ and love for one another even as he said to us
 he who keeps his laws is in god and god is in him and the spirit which he gave us is our witness that he is in us
 my loved ones do not put your faith in every spirit but put them to the test to see if they are from god because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world
 by this you may have knowledge of the spirit of god every spirit which says that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god
 and every spirit which does not say this is not from god this is the spirit of antichrist of which you have had word and it is in the world even now
 you are of god my little children and you have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world
 they are of the world so their talk is the worlds talk and the world gives ear to them
 we are of god he who has the knowledge of god gives ear to us he who is not of god does not give ear to us by this we may see which is the true spirit and which is the spirit of error
 my loved ones let us have love for one another because love is of god and everyone who has love is a child of god and has knowledge of god
 he who has no love has no knowledge of god because god is love
 and the love of god was made clear to us when he sent his only son into the world so that we might have life through him
 and this is love not that we had love for god but that he had love for us and sent his son to be an offering for our sins
 my loved ones if god had such love for us it is right for us to have love for one another
 no man has ever seen god if we have love for one another god is in us and his love is made complete in us
 and his spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us
 and we have seen and give witness that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
 everyone who says openly that jesus is the son of god has god in him and is in god
 and we have seen and had faith in the love which god has for us god is love and everyone who has love is in god and god is in him
 in this way love is made complete in us so that we may be without fear on the day of judging because as he is so are we in this world
 there is no fear in love true love has no room for fear because where fear is there is pain and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love
 we have the power of loving because he first had love for us
 if a man says i have love for god and has hate for his brother his words are false for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen able to have love for god whom he has not seen
 and this is the word which we have from him that he who has love for god is to have the same love for his brother
 everyone who has faith that jesus is the christ is a child of god and everyone who has love for the father has love for his child
 in this way we are certain that we have love for the children of god when we have love for god and keep his laws
 for loving god is keeping his laws and his laws are not hard
 anything which comes from god is able to overcome the world and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith
 who is able to overcome the world but the man who has faith that jesus is the son of god
 this is he who came by water and by blood jesus christ not by water only but by water and by blood
 and the spirit is the witness because the spirit is true
 there are three witnesses the spirit the water and the blood and all three are in agreement
 if we take the witness of men to be true the witness of god is greater because this is the witness which god has given about his son
 he who has faith in the son of god has the witness in himself he who has not faith in god makes him false because he has not faith in the witness which god has given about his son
 and his witness is this that god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son
 he who has the son has the life he who has not the son of god has not the life
 i have put these things in writing for you who have faith in the name of the son of god so that you may be certain that you have eternal life
 and we are certain that if we make any request to him which is right in his eyes he will give ear to us
 and if we are certain that he gives ear to all our requests we are equally certain that we will get our requests
 if a man sees his brother doing a sin which is not bad enough for death let him make a prayer to god and god will give life to him whose sin was not bad enough for death there is a sin whose punishment is death i do not say that he may make such a request then
 all evil doing is sin but death is not the punishment for every sort of sin
 we are certain that one who is a child of god will do no sin but the son of god keeps him so that he is not touched by the evil one
 we are certain that we are of god but all the world is in the power of the evil one
 and we are certain that the son of god has come and has given us a clear vision so that we may see him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ he is the true god and eternal life
 my little children keep yourselves from false gods
 i a ruler in the church send word to the noble sister who is of gods selection and to her children for whom i have true love and not only i but all who have knowledge of what is true
 because of this true knowledge which is in us and will be with us for ever
 may grace mercy and peace be with us from god the father and from jesus christ the son of the father in all true love
 it gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way even as we were ordered to do by the father
 and now my sister i make a request to you not sending you a new law but the law which we had from the first that we have love for one another
 and love is the keeping of his laws this is the law which was given to you from the first so that you might keep it
 because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world who do not give witness that jesus christ came in the flesh such a one is a false teacher and antichrist
 keep watch over yourselves so that you do not make our work of no effect but may get your full reward
 anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of christ has not god he who keeps to the teaching has the father and the son
 if anyone comes to you not having this teaching do not take him into your house or give him words of love
 for he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works
 having much to say to you it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink but i am hoping to come to you and to have talk with you face to face so that your joy may be full
 the children of your noble sister who is of gods selection send you their love
 i a ruler in the church send word to the well loved gaius for whom i have true love
 my loved one it is my prayer that you may do well in all things and be healthy in body even as your soul does well
 for it gave me great joy when some of the brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were walking in the true way
 i have no greater joy than to have news that my children are walking in the true way
 my loved one you are doing a good work in being kind to those brothers who come from other places
 who have given witness to the church of your love for them and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for as is right for servants of god
 for they went out for love of the name taking nothing from the gentiles
 so it is right for us to take in such men as guests so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith
 i sent a letter to the church but diotrephes whose desire is ever to have the first place among them will not have us there
 so if i come i will keep in mind the things he does talking against us with evil words and as if this was not enough he does not take the brothers into his house and those who are ready to take them in he keeps from doing so putting them out of the church if they do
 my loved one do not be copying what is evil but what is good he who does good is of god he who does evil has not seen god
 demetrius has the approval of all men and of what is true and we give the same witness and you are certain that our witness is true
 i had much to say to you but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen
 but i am hoping to see you in a short time and to have talk with you face to face 
 may you have peace your friends here send you their love give my love to our friends by name
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god and timothy the brother to the church of god which is in corinth with all the saints who are in all achaia
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort
 who gives us comfort in all our troubles so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by god
 for as we undergo more of the pain which christ underwent so through christ does our comfort become greater
 but if we are troubled it is for your comfort and salvation or if we are comforted it is for your comfort which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo
 and our hope for you is certain in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles so you will take part in the comfort
 for it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in asia that the weight of it was very great more than our power so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life
 yes we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves so that our hope might not be in ourselves but in god who is able to give life to the dead
 who gave us salvation from so great a death on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation
 you at the same time helping together by your prayer for us so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons praise may go up to god for us from all of them
 for our glory is in this in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world and most of all in relation to you has been holy and true in the eyes of god not in the wisdom of the flesh but in the grace of god
 for in our letters we say no other things to you but those which you are reading and to which you give agreement and it is my hope will go on doing so to the end
 even as you have been ready in part to say that we are your glory in the same way that you are ours in the day of the lord jesus
 and being certain of this it was my purpose to come to you before so that you might have a second grace
 and by way of corinth to go into macedonia and from there to come back again to you so that you might send me on my way to judaea
 if then i had such a purpose did i seem to be changing suddenly or am i guided in my purposes by the flesh saying yes today and no tomorrow
 as god is true our word to you is not yes and no
 for the son of god jesus christ whom we were preaching among you even i and silvanus and timothy was not yes and no but in him is yes
 for he is the yes to all the undertakings of god and by him all the words of god are made certain and put into effect to the glory of god through us
 now he who makes our faith strong together with you in christ and has given us of his grace is god
 and it is he who has put his stamp on us even the spirit as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory
 but god is my witness that it was in pity for you that i did not come to corinth at that time
 not that we have authority over your faith but we are helpers of your joy for it is faith which is your support
 now i paul myself make request to you by the quiet and gentle behaviour of christ i who am poor in spirit when with you but who say what is in my mind to you without fear when i am away from you
 yes i make my request to you so that when i am with you i may not have to make use of the authority which may be needed against some to whom we seem to be walking after the flesh
 for though we may be living in the flesh we are not fighting after the way of the flesh
  for the arms with which we are fighting are not those of the flesh but are strong before god for the destruction of high places 
 putting an end to reasonings and every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of god and causing every thought to come under the authority of christ
 being ready to give punishment to whatever is against his authority after you have made it clear that you are completely under his control
 give attention to the things which are before you if any man seems to himself to be christs let him keep in mind that we are as much christs as he is
 for though i might take pride in our authority  which the lord gave for building you up and not for your destruction  it will not be a cause of shame to me
 that i may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters
 for his letters they say have weight and are strong but in body he is feeble and his way of talking has little force
 let those who say this keep in mind that what we are in word by letters when we are away so will we be in act when we are present
 for we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves but these measuring themselves by themselves and making comparison of themselves with themselves are not wise
 we will not give glory to ourselves in over great measure but after the measure of the rule which god has given us a measure which comes even to you
 for we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are as if our authority did not come as far as to you for we came even as far as you with the good news of christ
 not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business that is for the work of others but having hope that with the growth of your faith we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work
 so that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are and not take credit for another mans work in making things ready to our hand
 but whoever has a desire for glory let his glory be in the lord
 for the lords approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself but on the lords opinion of him
 put up with me if i am a little foolish but truly you do put up with me
 for i have a very great care for you because you have been married by me to one husband and it is my desire to give you completely holy to christ
 but i have a fear that in some way as eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for christ
 for if anyone comes preaching another jesus from the one whose preachers we are or if you have got a different spirit or a different sort of good news from those which came to you how well you put up with these things
 for in my opinion i am in no way less than the most important of the apostles
 but though i am rough in my way of talking i am not so in knowledge as we have made clear to all by our acts among you
 or did i do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up because i gave you the good news of god without reward
 i took money from other churches as payment for my work so that i might be your servant
 and when i was present with you and was in need i let no man be responsible for me for the brothers when they came from macedonia gave me whatever was needed and in everything i kept myself from being a trouble to you and i will go on doing so
 as the true word of christ is in me i will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of achaia
 why because i have no love for you let god be judge
 but what i do that i will go on doing so that i may give no chance to those who are looking for one so that in the cause of their pride they may be seen to be the same as we are
 for such men are false apostles workers of deceit making themselves seem like apostles of christ
 and it is no wonder for even satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light
 so it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness whose end will be the reward of their works
 i say again let me not seem foolish to anyone but if i do put up with me as such so that i may take a little glory to myself
 what i am now saying is not by the order of the lord but as a foolish person taking credit to myself as it seems
 seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh i will do the same
 for you put up with the foolish gladly being wise yourselves
 you put up with a man if he makes servants of you if he makes profit out of you if he makes you prisoners if he puts himself in a high place if he gives you blows on the face
 i say this by way of shaming ourselves as if we had been feeble but if anyone puts himself forward  i am talking like a foolish person  i will do the same
 are they hebrews so am i are they of israel so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i
 are they servants of christ  i am talking foolishly  i am more so i have had more experience of hard work of prisons of blows more than measure of death
 five times the jews gave me forty blows but one
 three times i was whipped with rods once i was stoned three times the ship i was in came to destruction at sea a night and a day i have been in the water
 in frequent travels in dangers on rivers in dangers from outlaws in dangers from my countrymen in dangers from the gentiles in dangers in the town in dangers in the waste land in dangers at sea in dangers among false brothers
 in hard work and weariness in frequent watchings going without food and drink cold and in need of clothing
 in addition to all the other things there is that which comes on me every day the care of all the churches
 who is feeble and i am not feeble who is in danger of falling and i am not angry
 if i have to take credit to myself i will do so in the things in which i am feeble
 the god and father of our lord jesus christ to whom be praise for ever is witness that the things which i say are true
 in damascus the ruler under aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of damascus in order to take me
 and being let down in a basket from the wall through a window i got free from his hands
 as it is necessary for me to take glory to myself though it is not a good thing i will come to visions and revelations of the lord
 i have knowledge of a man in christ fourteen years back  if he was in the body or out of the body i am not able to say but god only  who was taken up to the third heaven
 and i have knowledge of such a man  if he was in the body or out of the body i am not able to say but god only 
 how he was taken up into paradise and words came to his ears which may not be said and which man is not able to say
 on account of such a one i will have glory for myself i will take no glory but only in my feeble body
 for if i had a desire to take credit to myself it would not be foolish for i would be saying what is true but i will not for fear that i might seem to any man more than he sees me to be or has word from me that i am
 and because the revelations were so very great in order that i might not be overmuch lifted up there was given to me a thorn in the flesh one sent from satan to give me pain
 and about this thing i made request to the lord three times that it might be taken away from me
 and he said to me my grace is enough for you for my power is made complete in what is feeble most gladly then will i take pride in my feeble body so that the power of christ may be on me
 so i take pleasure in being feeble in unkind words in needs in cruel attacks in troubles on account of christ for when i am feeble then am i strong
 i have been forced by you to become foolish though it was right for my praise to have come from you for in no way was i less than the chief of the apostles though i am nothing
 truly the signs of an apostle were done among you in quiet strength with wonders and acts of power
 for what is there in which you were made less than the other churches but in the one thing that i was not a trouble to you let me have forgiveness for this wrong
 this is now the third time that i am ready to come to you and i will not be a trouble to you my desire is for you not for your property for it is not the childrens business to make store for their fathers but the fathers for the children
 and i will gladly give all i have for your souls if i have the more love for you am i to be loved the less
 but let it be so that i was not a trouble to you myself but  someone may say  being false i took you with deceit
 did i make a profit out of you by any of those whom i sent to you
 i gave orders to titus and i sent the brother with him did titus make any profit out of you were we not guided by the same spirit in the same ways
 it may seem to you that all this time we have been attempting to put ourselves in the right but we are saying these things before god in christ for all things dear brothers are for your profit
 for i have a fear that when i come you may not be answering to my desire and that i may not be answering to yours that there may be fighting hate angry feeling divisions evil talk about others secrets thoughts of pride outbursts against authority
 and that when i come again my god may put me to shame among you and i may have grief for those who have done wrong before and have had no regret for their unclean ways and for the evil desires of the flesh to which they have given way
 this is the third time that i am coming to you from the mouth of two or three witnesses will every word be made certain
 i said before and still say it before i come as being present for the second time though i am still away from you to those who have done wrong before and to all the others that if i come again i will not have pity
 seeing that you are looking for a sign of christ giving out his word in me who is not feeble in relation to you but is strong in you
 for he was feeble in that he was put to death on the cross but he is living by the power of god and we are feeble in him but we will be living with him through the power of god in relation to you
 make a test of yourselves if you are in the faith make certain of yourselves or are you not conscious in yourselves that jesus christ is in you if you are truly christs
 but it is my hope that you will have no doubt that we are truly christs
 now our prayer to god is that you may do no evil not in order that it may be put to our credit but so that you may do what is right whatever we may seem
 because we are able to do nothing against what is true but only for it
 for we are glad when we are feeble and you are strong and this is our prayer even that you may be made complete
 for this cause i am writing these things while i am away so that there may be need for me when i am present to make use of sharp measures by the authority which the lord has given me for building up and not for destruction
 let this be my last word brothers be glad be complete be comforted be of the same mind be at peace with one another and the god of love and peace will be with you
 give one another a holy kiss
 all the saints send their love to you
 the grace of our lord jesus christ and the love of god and the harmony of the holy spirit be with you all
 but it was my decision for myself not to come again to you with sorrow
 for if i give you sorrow who then will make me glad but he who is made sad by me
 and i said this very thing in my letter for fear that when i came i might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy being certain of this that my joy is the joy of you all
 for out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping i sent my letter to you not to give you sorrow but so that you might see how great is the love which i have to you
 but if anyone has been a cause of sorrow he has been so not to me only but in some measure to all of you  i say this that i may not be over hard on you 
 let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him
 so that now on the other hand it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you for fear that his sorrow may be over great
 for which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts
 and for the same reason i sent you a letter so that i might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things
 but if you give forgiveness to anyone i do the same for if i have given forgiveness for anything i have done it because of you in the person of christ
 so that satan may not get the better of us for we are not without knowledge of his designs
 now when i came to troas for the good news of christ and there was an open door for me in the lord
 i had no rest in my spirit because titus my brother was not there so i went away from them and came into macedonia
 but praise be to god who makes us strong to overcome in christ and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him
 for we are a sweet perfume of christ to god in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction
 to the one it is a perfume of death to death to the other a perfume of life to life and who is enough for such things
 for we are not like the great number who make use of the word of god for profit but our words are true as from god being said as before god in christ
 do we seem to be again attempting to put ourselves in the right or have we need as some have of letters of approval to you or from you
 you yourselves are our letter whose writing is in our heart open for every mans reading and knowledge
 for you are clearly a letter of christ the fruit of our work recorded not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in stone but in hearts of flesh
 and this is the certain faith which we have in god through christ
 not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit but our power comes from god
 who has made us able to be servants of a new agreement not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter gives death but the spirit gives life
 for if the operation of the law giving death recorded in letters on stone came with glory so that the eyes of the children of israel had to be turned away from the face of moses because of its glory a glory which was only for a time
 will not the operation of the spirit have a much greater glory
 for if the operation of the law producing punishment had its glory how much greater will be the operation of the spirit causing righteousness
 for the glory of the first no longer seems to be glory because of the greater glory of that which comes after
 for if the order which was for a time had its glory much more will the eternal order have its glory
 having then such a hope we keep nothing back
 and are not like moses who put a veil on his face so that the children of israel might not see clearly to the end of the present order of things
 but their minds were made hard for to this very day at the reading of the old agreement the same veil is still unlifted though it is taken away in christ
 but to this day at the reading of the law of moses a veil is over their heart
 but when it is turned to the lord the veil will be taken away
 now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there the heart is free
 but we all with unveiled face giving back as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as from the lord who is the spirit
 for this reason because we have been made servants of this new order through the mercy given to us we are strong
 and we have given up the secret things of shame not walking in false ways and not making use of the word of god with deceit but by the revelation of what is true as before god we have the approval of every mans sense of right and wrong
 but if our good news is veiled it is veiled from those who are on the way to destruction
 because the god of this world has made blind the minds of those who have not faith so that the light of the good news of the glory of christ who is the image of god might not be shining on them
 for our preaching is not about ourselves but about christ jesus as lord and ourselves as your servants through jesus
 seeing that it is god who said let light be shining out of the dark who has put in our hearts the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
 but we have this wealth in vessels of earth so that it may be seen that the power comes not from us but from god
 troubles are round us on every side but we are not shut in things are hard for us but we see a way out of them
 we are cruelly attacked but not without hope we are made low but we are not without help
 in our bodies there is ever the mark of the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may be seen in our bodies
 for while living we are still being given up to death because of jesus so that the life of jesus may be seen in our flesh though it is under the power of death
 so then death is working in us but life in you
 but having the same spirit of faith as it is said in the writings the words of my mouth came from the faith in my heart in the same way our words are the outcome of our faith
 because we are certain that he who made the lord jesus come back from the dead will do the same for us and will give us a place in his glory with you
 for we go through all things on account of you because the greater the number to whom the grace is given the greater is the praise to the glory of god
 for which cause we do not give way to weariness but though our outer man is getting feebler our inner man is made new day by day
 for our present trouble which is only for a short time is working out for us a much greater weight of glory
 while our minds are not on the things which are seen but on the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are for a time but the things which are not seen are eternal
 for we are conscious that if this our tent of flesh is taken down we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in heaven
 for in this we are crying in weariness greatly desiring to be clothed with our house from heaven
 so that our spirits may not be unclothed
 for truly we who are in this tent do give out cries of weariness for the weight of care which is on us not because we are desiring to be free from the body but so that we may have our new body and death may be overcome by life
 now he who has made us for this very thing is god who has given us the spirit as a witness of what is to come
 so then we are ever without fear and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the lord
  for we are walking by faith not by seeing 
 we are without fear desiring to be free from the body and to be with the lord
 for this reason we make it our purpose in the body or away from it to be well pleasing to him
 for we all have to come before christ to be judged so that every one of us may get his reward for the things done in the body good or bad
 having in mind then the fear of the lord we put these things before men but god sees our hearts and it is my hope that we may seem right in your eyes
 we are not again requesting your approval but we are giving you the chance of taking pride in us so that you may be able to give an answer to those whose glory is in seeming and not in the heart
 for if we are foolish it is to god or if we are serious it is for you
 for it is the love of christ which is moving us because we are of the opinion that if one was put to death for all then all have undergone death
 and that he underwent death for all so that the living might no longer be living to themselves but to him who underwent death for them and came back from the dead
 for this reason from this time forward we have knowledge of no man after the flesh even if we have had knowledge of christ after the flesh we have no longer any such knowledge
 so if any man is in christ he is in a new world the old things have come to an end they have truly become new
 but all things are of god who has made us at peace with himself through christ and has given to us the work of making peace
 that is that god was in christ making peace between the world and himself not putting their sins to their account and having given to us the preaching of this news of peace
 so we are the representatives of christ as if god was making a request to you through us we make our request to you in the name of christ be at peace with god
 for him who had no knowledge of sin god made to be sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of god in him
 we then working together with god make our request to you not to take the grace of god to no purpose
  for he says i have given ear to you at a good time and i have been your helper in a day of salvation see now is the good time now is the day of salvation 
 giving no cause for trouble in anything so that no one may be able to say anything against our work
 but in everything making it clear that we are the servants of god in quiet strength in troubles in need in sorrow
 in blows in prisons in attacks in hard work in watchings in going without food
 in a clean heart in knowledge in long waiting in being kind in the holy spirit in true love
 in the true word in the power of god with the arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left
 by glory and by shame by an evil name and a good name as untrue and still true
 unnoted but still kept fully in mind as near to death but still living as undergoing punishment but not put to death
 as full of sorrow but ever glad as poor but giving wealth to others as having nothing but still having all things
 our mouth is open to you o corinthians our heart is wide
 it is not our feelings to you which are narrow but yours to us
 now to give me back payment of the same sort  i am talking as to my children  let your hearts be wide open to me
 do not keep company with those who have not faith for what is there in common between righteousness and evil or between light and dark
 and what agreement is there between christ and the evil one or what part has one who has faith with one who has not
 and what agreement has the house of god with images for we are a house of the living god even as god has said i will be living among them and walking with them and i will be their god and they will be my people
 for which cause come out from among them and be separate says the lord and let no unclean thing come near you and i will take you for myself
 and will be a father to you and you will be my sons and daughters says the lord the ruler of all
 because god then will give us such rewards dear brothers let us make ourselves clean from all evil of flesh and spirit and become completely holy in the fear of god
 let your hearts be open to us we have done no man wrong no man has been damaged by us we have made no profit out of any man
 it is not with the purpose of judging you that i say this for i have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together
 my words to you are without fear i am full of pride on account of you i have great comfort and joy in all our troubles
 for even when we had come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side there were fightings outside and fears inside
 but god who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of titus
 and not by his coming only but by the comfort which he had in you while he gave us word of your desire your sorrow your care for me so that i was still more glad
 for though my letter gave you pain i have no regret for it now though i had before for i see that the letter gave you pain but only for a time
 now i am glad not that you had sorrow but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything
 for the sorrow which god gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart in which there is no reason for grief but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death
 for you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before god what clearing of yourselves what wrath against sin what fear what desire what serious purpose what punishment in everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business
 so though i sent you a letter it was not only because of the man who did the wrong or because of him to whom the wrong was done but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of god
 so we have been comforted and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of titus for his spirit had been made glad by you all
 for i was not put to shame in anything in which i may have made clear to him my pride in you but as we said nothing to you but what was true so the good things which i said to titus about you were seen by him to be true
 and his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all how you gave way to his authority and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour
 it gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way
 and now we give you news brothers about the grace of god which has been given to the churches of macedonia
 how while they were undergoing every sort of trouble and were in the greatest need they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others
 for i give them witness that as they were able and even more than they were able they gave from the impulse of their hearts
 seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints
 and going even farther than our hope they first gave themselves to the lord and to us after the purpose of god
 so that we made a request to titus that as he had made a start before so he might make this grace complete in you
 and that as you are full of every good thing of faith of the word of knowledge of a ready mind and of love to us so you may be full of this grace in the same way
 i am not giving you an order but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love
 for you see the grace of our lord jesus christ how though he had wealth he became poor on your account so that through his need you might have wealth
 and in this i give my opinion for it is to your profit who were the first to make a start a year before not only to do this but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it
 then make the doing of it complete so that as you had a ready mind you may give effect to it as you are able
 for if there is a ready mind a man will have gods approval in the measure of what he has and not of what he has not
 and i am not saying this so that others may get off free while the weight comes on you
 but so that things may be equal that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way making things equal
 as it says in the writings he who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough
 but praise be to god who puts the same care for you into the heart of titus
 for while he gladly gave ear to our request he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart
 and with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches
 and not only so but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the lord and to make clear that our mind was ready
 and so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands
 for the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval not only of the lord but of men
 and we have sent with them our brother whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you
 if any question comes up about titus he is my brother worker working with me for you or about the others they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of christ
 make clear then to them as representatives of the churches the quality of your love and that the things which we have said about you are true
 but there is no need for me to say anything in my letter about the giving to the saints
 for i have before made clear to those of macedonia my pride in your ready mind saying to them that achaia has been ready for a year back and a great number have been moved to do the same by your example
 but i have sent the brothers so that the good things we said about you may be seen to be true and that as i said you may be ready
 for fear that if any from macedonia come with me and you are not ready we  not to say you  might be put to shame in this thing
 so it seemed to me wise for the brothers to go before and see that the amount which you had undertaken to give was ready so that it might be a cause for praise and not as if we were making profit out of you
 but in the writings it says he who puts in only a small number of seeds will get in the same and he who puts them in from a full hand will have produce in full measure from them
 let every man do after the purpose of his heart not giving with grief or by force for god takes pleasure in a ready giver
 and god is able to give you all grace in full measure so that ever having enough of all things you may be full of every good work
 as it is said in the writings he has sent out far and wide he has given to the poor his righteousness is for ever
 and he who gives seed for putting into the field and bread for food will take care of the growth of your seed at the same time increasing the fruits of your righteousness
 your wealth being increased in everything with a simple mind causing praise to god through us
 for this work of giving not only takes care of the needs of the saints but is the cause of much praise to god
 for when through this work of giving they see what you are they give glory to god for the way in which you have given yourselves to the good news of christ and for the wealth of your giving to them and to all
 while their hearts go out to you in love and in prayer for you because of the great grace of god which is in you
 praise be to god for what he has given which words have no power to say
 paul and silvanus and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
 grace to you and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ
 it is right for us to give praise to god at all times for you brothers because of the great increase of your faith and the wealth of your love for one another
 so that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of god for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through
 which is a clear sign of the decision which god in his righteousness has made to give you a part in his kingdom for which you have undergone this pain
 for it is an act of righteousness on gods part to give trouble as their reward to those who are troubling you
 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus comes from heaven with the angels of his power in flames of fire
 to give punishment to those who have no knowledge of god and to those who do not give ear to the good news of our lord jesus
 whose reward will be eternal destruction from the face of the lord and from the glory of his strength
 at his coming when he will have glory in his saints and will be a cause of wonder in all those who had faith  because our witness among you had effect  in that day
 for this reason you are ever in our prayers that you may seem to our god such as may have a part in his purpose and that by his power he will make all his good purpose and the work of faith complete
 so that glory may be given to the name of our lord jesus through you and you may have glory in him by the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
 now as to the coming of the lord jesus christ and our meeting with him it is our desire my brothers
 that you may not be moved in mind or troubled by a spirit or by a word or by a letter as from us with the suggestion that the day of the lord is even now come
 give no belief to false words because there will first be a falling away from the faith and the revelation of the man of sin the son of destruction
 who puts himself against all authority lifting himself up over all which is named god or is given worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god putting himself forward as god
 have you no memory of what i said when i was with you giving you word of these things
 and now it is clear to you what is keeping back his revelation till the time comes for him to be seen
 for the secret of evil is even now at work but there is one who is keeping back the evil till he is taken out of the way
 and then will come the revelation of that evil one whom the lord jesus will put to death with the breath of his mouth and give to destruction by the revelation of his coming
 even the one whose coming is marked by the working of satan with all power and signs and false wonders
 and with every deceit of wrongdoing among those whose fate is destruction because they were quite without that love of the true faith by which they might have salvation
 and for this cause god will give them up to the power of deceit and they will put their faith in what is false
 so that they all may be judged who had no faith in what is true but took pleasure in evil
 but it is right for us to give praise to god at all times for you brothers loved by the lord because it was the purpose of god from the first that you might have salvation being made holy by the spirit and by faith in what is true
 and in this purpose he gave you a part through the good news of which we were the preachers even that you might have part in the glory of our lord jesus christ
 so then brothers be strong in purpose and keep the teaching which has been given to you by word or by letter from us
 now our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who had love for us and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace
 give you comfort and strength in every good work and word
 for the rest my brothers let there be prayer for us that the word of the lord may go forward with increasing glory even as it does with you
 and that we may be made free from foolish and evil men for not all have faith
 but the lord is true who will give you strength and keep you safe from evil
 and we have faith in the lord about you that you are doing and will do the things about which we give you orders
 and may your hearts be guided by the lord into the love of god and quiet waiting for christ
 now we give you orders brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ to keep away from all those whose behaviour is not well ordered and in harmony with the teaching which they had from us
 for you yourselves are used to taking us as your example because our life among you was ruled by order
 and we did not take food from any man for nothing but were working hard night and day not to be a trouble to any of you
 not because we have not the right but to make ourselves an example to you so that you might do the same
 for even when we were with you we gave you orders saying if any man does no work let him not have food
 for it has come to our ears that there are some among you whose behaviour is uncontrolled who do no work at all but are over interested in the business of others
 now to such we give orders and make request in the lord jesus that working quietly they get their living
 and you my brothers do not get tired of well doing
 and if any man does not give attention to what we have said in this letter take note of that man and keep away from him so that he may be shamed
 have no feeling of hate for him but take him in hand seriously as a brother
 now the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way may the lord be with you all
 these words of love to you at the end are in my writing pauls writing and this is the mark of every letter from me
 may the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god in the hope of the life which is in christ jesus
 to timothy my well loved child grace mercy peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord
 i give praise to god whose servant i have been with a heart free from sin from the time of my fathers because in my prayers at all times the thought of you is with me night and day
 desiring to see you keeping in my memory your weeping so that i may be full of joy
 having in mind your true faith which first was in your mothers mother lois and in your mother eunice and i am certain is now in you
 for this reason i say to you let that grace of god which is in you given to you by my hands have living power
 for god did not give us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of self control
 have no feeling of shame then for the witness of our lord or for me his prisoner but undergo all things for the good news in the measure of the power of god
 who gave us salvation marking us out for his purpose not on account of our works but in the measure of his purpose and his grace which was given to us in christ jesus before times eternal
 but has now been made clear by the revelation of our saviour christ jesus who put an end to death and made life unending come to light through the good news
 of which i was made a preacher and an apostle and a teacher
 and for which i undergo these things but i have no feeling of shame for i have knowledge of him in whom i have faith and i am certain that he is able to keep that which i have given into his care till that day
 keep the form of those true words which you had from me in faith and love which is in christ jesus
 that good thing which was given to you keep safe through the holy spirit which is in us
 you have had news that all those in asia went away from me among whom are phygelus and hermogenes
 may the lord give mercy to the house of onesiphorus because he frequently gave me help and had no feeling of shame because i was in chains
 but when he was in rome he went in search of me everywhere and came to me
  may he have the lords mercy in that day  and of all he did for me at ephesus you have full knowledge
 so then my child be strong in the grace which is in christ jesus
 and the things which i have said to you before a number of witnesses give to those of the faith so that they may be teachers of others
 be ready to do without the comforts of life as one of the army of christ jesus
 a fighting man when he is with the army keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army
 and if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules
 it is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit
 give thought to what i say for the lord will give you wisdom in all things
 keep in mind jesus christ of the seed of david who came back from the dead as my good news gives witness
 in which i put up with the hardest conditions even prison chains like one who has done a crime but the word of god is not in chains
 but i undergo all things for the saints so that they may have salvation in christ jesus with eternal glory
 this is a true saying if we undergo death with him then will we be living with him
 if we go on to the end then we will be ruling with him if we say we have no knowledge of him then he will say he has no knowledge of us
 if we are without faith still he keeps faith for he will never be untrue to himself
 put these things before them giving them orders in the name of the lord to keep themselves from fighting about words which is of no profit only causing error in their hearers
 let it be your care to get the approval of god as a workman who has no cause for shame giving the true word in the right way
 but take no part in wrong and foolish talk for those who do so will go farther into evil
 and their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh such are hymenaeus and philetus
 men whose ideas are all false who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place overturning the faith of some
 but gods strong base is unchanging having this sign the lord has knowledge of those who are his and let everyone by whom the name of the lord is named be turned away from evil
 now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but others of wood and earth and some which are honoured and some without honour
 if a man makes himself clean from these he will be a vessel for honour made holy ready for the masters use ready for every good work
 but keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young and go after righteousness faith love peace with those whose prayers go up to the lord from a clean heart
 and put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings seeing that they are a cause of trouble
 for it is not right for the lords servant to make trouble but he is to be gentle to all ready in teaching putting up with wrong
 gently guiding those who go against the teaching if by chance god may give them a change of heart and true knowledge
 and so they may get themselves free from the net of the evil one being made the prisoners of the lords servant for the purpose of god
 but be certain of this that in the last days times of trouble will come
 for men will be lovers of self lovers of money uplifted in pride given to bitter words going against the authority of their fathers never giving praise having no religion
 without natural love bitter haters saying evil of others violent and uncontrolled hating all good
 false to their friends acting without thought lifted up in mind loving pleasure more than god
 having a form of religion but turning their backs on the power of it go not with these
 for these are they who go secretly into houses making prisoners of foolish women weighted down with sin turned from the way by their evil desires
 ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of what is true
 and as james and jambres went against moses so do these go against what is true men of evil minds who tested by faith are seen to be false
 but they will go no farther for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men as theirs was in the end
 but you took as your example my teaching behaviour purpose and faith my long waiting my love my quiet undergoing of trouble
 my punishments and pain the things which came to me at antioch at iconium at lystra the cruel attacks made on me and the lord made me free from them all
 yes and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of god in christ jesus will be cruelly attacked
 evil and false men will become worse and worse using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit
 but see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain conscious of who has been your teacher
 and that from the time when you were a child you have had knowledge of the holy writings which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith in christ jesus
 every holy writing which comes from god is of profit for teaching for training for guiding for education in righteousness
 so that the man of god may be complete trained and made ready for every good work
 i give you orders before god and christ jesus who will be the judge of the living and the dead and by his revelation and his kingdom
 be preaching the word at all times in every place make protests say sharp words give comfort with long waiting and teaching
 for the time will come when they will not take the true teaching but moved by their desires they will get for themselves a great number of teachers for the pleasure of hearing them
 and shutting their ears to what is true will be turned away to belief in foolish stories
 but be self controlled in all things do without comfort go on preaching the good news completing the work which has been given you to do
 for i am even now being offered and my end is near
 i have made a good fight i have come to the end of my journey i have kept the faith
 from now on the crown of righteousness is made ready for me which the lord the upright judge will give to me at that day and not only to me but to all those who have had love for his revelation
 do your best to come to me before long
 for demas has gone away from me for love of this present life and has gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia titus to dalmatia
 only luke is with me get mark and take him with you for he is of use to me in the work
 tychicus i sent to ephesus
 the coat which i did not take from troas and which is with carpus get when you come and the books specially the papers
 alexander the copper worker did me much wrong the lord will give him the reward of his works
 but be on the watch for him for he was violent in his attacks on our teaching
 at my first meeting with my judges no one took my part but all went away from me may it not be put to their account
 but the lord was by my side and gave me strength so that through me the news might be given out in full measure and all the gentiles might give ear and i was taken out of the mouth of the lion
 the lord will keep me safe from every evil work and will give me salvation in his kingdom in heaven to whom be glory for ever and ever so be it
 give my love to prisca and aquila and those of the house of onesiphorus
 erastus was stopping at corinth but trophimus when i last saw him was at miletus ill
 do your best to come before the winter eubulus sends you his love and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brothers
 the lord be with your spirit grace be with you
 i have given an earlier account o theophilus of all the things which jesus did and of his teaching from the first
 till the day when he was taken up to heaven after he had given his orders through the holy spirit to the apostles of whom he had made selection
 and to whom he gave clear and certain signs that he was living after his death for he was seen by them for forty days and gave them teaching about the kingdom of god
 and when they were all together with him he gave them orders not to go away from jerusalem but to keep there waiting till the word of the father was put into effect of which he said i have given you knowledge
 for the baptism of john was with water but you will have baptism with the holy spirit after a little time
 so when they were together they said to him lord will you at this time give back the kingdom to israel
 and he said to them it is not for you to have knowledge of the time and the order of events which the father has kept in his control
 but you will have power when the holy spirit has come on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and all judaea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
 and when he had said these things while they were looking he was taken up and went from their view into a cloud
 and while they were looking up to heaven with great attention two men came to them in white clothing
 and said o men of galilee why are you looking up into heaven this jesus who was taken from you into heaven will come again in the same way as you saw him go into heaven
 then they went back to jerusalem from the mountain named olivet which is near jerusalem a sabbath days journey away
 and when they came in they went up into the room where they were living peter and john and james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas the son of james
 and they all with one mind gave themselves up to prayer with the women and mary the mother of jesus and his brothers
 and in those days peter got up among the brothers  there were about one hundred and twenty of them  and said
 my brothers the word of god had to be put into effect which the holy spirit had said before by the mouth of david about judas who was guide to those who took jesus
 for he was numbered among us and had his part in our work
  now this man with the reward of his evil doing got for himself a field and falling head first came to a sudden and violent end there
 and this came to the knowledge of all those who were living in jerusalem so that the field was named in their language akel dama or the field of blood 
 for in the book of psalms it says let his house be waste and let no man be living in it and let his position be taken by another
 for this reason of the men who have been with us all the time while the lord jesus went in and out among us
 starting from the baptism of john till he went up from us one will have to be a witness with us of his coming back from death
 and they made selection of two joseph named barsabbas whose other name was justus and matthias
 and they made prayers and said lord having knowledge of the hearts of all men make clear which of these two has been marked out by you
 to take that position as a servant and apostle from which judas by his sin was shut out so that he might go to his place
 and they put it to the decision of chance and the decision was given for matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
 now there was a certain man in caesarea named cornelius the captain of the italian band of the army
 a serious minded man fearing god with all his family he gave much money to the poor and made prayer to god at all times
 he saw in a vision clearly at about the ninth hour of the day an angel of the lord coming to him and saying to him cornelius 
 and he looking on him in fear said what is it lord and he said to him your prayers and your offerings have come up to god and he has kept them in mind
 now send men to joppa and get one simon named peter
 who is living with simon a leather worker whose house is by the sea
 and when the angel who said these words to him had gone away he sent for two of his house servants and a god fearing man of the army one of those who were waiting on him at all times
 and having given them an account of everything he sent them to joppa
 now the day after when they were on their journey and were near the town peter went up to the top of the house for prayer about the sixth hour
 and he was in need of food but while they were getting it ready a deep sleep came on him
 and he saw the heavens opening and a vessel coming down like a great cloth let down on the earth
 in which were all sorts of beasts and birds
 and a voice came to him saying come peter take them for food
 but peter said no lord for i have never taken food which is common or unclean
 and the voice came to him a second time what god has made clean do not you make common
 and this was done three times and then the vessel was taken back into heaven
 now while peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision the men who were sent by cornelius having made search for simons house came to the door
 to see if simon named peter was living there
 and while peter was turning the vision over in his mind the spirit said to him see three men are looking for you
 go down then and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them
 and peter went down to the men and said i am the man you are looking for why have you come
 and they said cornelius a captain an upright and god fearing man respected by all the nation of the jews had word from god by an angel to send for you to his house and to give hearing to your words
 so he took them in for the night and the day after he went with them taking some of the brothers from joppa with him
 and the day after that they came to caesarea and cornelius was waiting for them having got together his relations and his near friends
 and when peter came in cornelius came to him and falling down at his feet gave him worship
 but peter lifting him up said get up for i am a man as you are
 and saying these words he went in and saw that a great number of people had come together
 and he said to them you yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation but god has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean
 and so i came without question when i was sent for what then is your purpose in sending for me
 and cornelius said four days from now i was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour and i saw before me a man in shining clothing
 who said cornelius your prayer has come to the ears of god and your offerings are kept in his memory
 send then to joppa and get simon named peter to come to you he is living in the house of simon a leather worker by the sea
 so straight away i sent for you and you have done well to come and now we are all present before god ready to give attention to all the things which the lord has given you to say
 then peter said truly i see clearly that god is no respecter of persons
 but in every nation the man who has fear of him and does righteousness is pleasing to him
 the word which he sent to the children of israel giving the good news of peace through jesus christ  who is lord of all   
 that word you yourselves have knowledge of which was made public through all judaea starting from galilee after the baptism of which john was the preacher
 about jesus of nazareth how god gave the holy spirit to him with power and how he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits for god was with him
 and we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the jews and in jerusalem whom they put to death hanging him on a tree
 on the third day god gave him back to life and let him be seen
 not by all the people but by witnesses marked out before by god even by us who took food and drink with him after he came back from the dead
 and he gave us orders to give news of this to the people and to give public witness that this is he whom god has made judge of the living and the dead
 to him all the prophets give witness that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins
 while peter was saying these words the holy spirit came on all those who were hearing the word
 and the jews of the faith who had come with peter were full of wonder because the holy spirit was given to the gentiles
 and they were talking in tongues and giving glory to god then peter said
 will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the holy spirit as we have
 and he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of jesus christ then they kept him with them for some days
 now the apostles and the brothers who were in judaea had news that the word of god had been given to the gentiles
 and when peter came to jerusalem those who kept the rule of circumcision had an argument with him
 saying you went to men without circumcision and took food with them
 but peter gave them an account of it all in order saying to them
 i was in the town of joppa at prayer and falling into a deep sleep i saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven and it came down to me
 and looking on it with attention i saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds
 and a voice came to my ears saying come peter take them for food
 but i said no lord for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth
 but the voice coming a second time from heaven said what god has made clean do not you make common
 and this was done three times and they were all taken up again into heaven
 and at that minute three men sent from caesarea came to the house where we were
 and the spirit gave me orders to go with them doubting nothing and these six brothers came with me and we went into that mans house
 and he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house saying send to joppa and get simon named peter to come to you
 who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation
 and while i was talking to them the holy spirit came on them as on us at first
 and the words of the lord came into my mind how he said the baptism of john was with water but you will have baptism with the holy spirit
 if then god gave them when they had faith in the lord jesus christ the same as he gave to us who was i to go against god
 and hearing these things they said nothing more but gave glory to god saying then to the gentiles as to us has god given a change of heart so that they may have life
 then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about stephen went as far as phoenicia and cyprus preaching to the jews only
 but some of them men of cyprus and cyrene when they came to antioch gave the good news about the lord jesus to the greeks
 and the power of the lord was with them and a great number had faith and were turned to the lord
 and news of them came to the ears of the church at jerusalem and they sent barnabas as far as antioch
 who when he came and saw the grace of god was glad and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the lord with all the strength of their hearts
 for he was a good man and full of the holy spirit and of faith and a great number were joined to the lord
 then he went on to tarsus looking for saul
 and when he had come across him he took him to antioch and they were with the church there for a year teaching the people and the disciples were first given the name of christians in antioch
 now in those days prophets came from jerusalem to antioch
 and one of them named agabus said publicly through the spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth which came about in the time of claudius
 and the disciples everyone as he was able made a decision to send help to the brothers living in judaea
 which they did sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of barnabas and saul
 now about that time herod the king made cruel attacks on the christians
 and he put james the brother of john to death with the sword
 and when he saw that this was pleasing to the jews he went on to take peter in addition this was at the time of the feast of unleavened bread
 and having taken him he put him in prison with four bands of armed men to keep watch over him his purpose being to take him out to the people after the passover
 so peter was kept in prison but the church made strong prayer to god for him
 and when herod was about to take him out the same night peter was sleeping in chains between two armed men and the watchmen were keeping watch before the door of the prison
 and a great light was seen shining in the room and an angel of the lord came to peter and touching him on his side so that he came out of his sleep said get up quickly and his chains came off his hands
 then the angel said put on your shoes and get ready to go and he did so and he said put your coat round you and come with me
 and he went out after him and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision
 and when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town which came open by itself and they went out and down one street and then the angel went away
 and when peter came to his senses he said now truly i am certain that the lord has sent his angel and taken me out of the hands of herod against all the hopes of the jews
 and when he became clear about this he went to the house of mary the mother of john named mark where a number of them had come together for prayer
 and he gave a blow on the door and a young girl came to it named rhoda
 and hearing the voice of peter in her joy she went running without opening the door to say that peter was outside
 and they said to her you are off your head but still she said with decision that it was so and they said it is his angel
 but peter went on giving blows on the door and when it was open and they saw him they were full of wonder
 but he made a sign to them with his hand to be quiet and gave them an account of how the lord had taken him out of prison and he said give the news to james and the brothers and then he went away
 now when it was day the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of peter
 and herod when he sent for him and he was not there after questioning the watchmen gave orders that they were to be put to death then he went down from judaea to caesarea for a time
 now he was very angry with the people of tyre and sidon and they came to him all together and having made friends with blastus the controller of the kings house they made a request for peace because their country was dependent on the kings country for its food
 and on the day which had been fixed herod dressed in his robes and seated in his place made a public statement to them
 and the people with loud cries said it is the voice of a god not of a man
 and straight away the angel of the lord sent a disease on him because he did not give the glory to god and his flesh was wasted away by worms and so he came to his end
 but the word of the lord went on increasing
 and barnabas and saul came back from jerusalem when their work was ended taking with them john named mark
 now there were at antioch in the church there prophets and teachers barnabas and symeon who was named niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen a relation of herod the king and saul
 and while they were doing the lords work and going without food the holy spirit said let barnabas and saul be given to me for the special work for which they have been marked out by me
 then after prayer and going without food they put their hands on them and sent them away
 so being sent out by the holy spirit they went down to seleucia and from there they went by ship to cyprus
 and at salamis they were preaching the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and john was with them helping them
 and when they had gone through all the island to paphos they came across a certain wonder worker and false prophet a jew whose name was bar jesus
 who was with the ruler sergius paulus an able man this man sent for barnabas and saul desiring to have knowledge of the word of god
 but elymas the wonder worker  for that is the sense of his name  put himself against them with the purpose of turning the ruler from the faith
 but saul whose other name is paul being full of the holy spirit looking hard at him said
 o you who are full of false tricks and evil ways a son of the evil one hating all righteousness will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the lord
 and now see the hand of the lord is on you and you will be blind and not able to see the sun for a time and straight away a dark mist came down on him and he went about looking for a guide
 then the ruler when he saw what was done had faith being full of wonder at the teaching of the lord
 then paul and those who were with him went by ship from paphos and came to perga in pamphylia and there john went away from them and came back to jerusalem
 but they going through from perga came to antioch in pisidia and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath and were seated
 and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them saying brothers if you have a word of comfort for the people say on
 and paul getting up and making a sign with his hand said men of israel and you who have the fear of god give ear
 the god of this people israel made selection of our fathers lifting the people up from their low condition when they were living in the land of egypt and with a strong arm took them out of it
 and for about forty years he put up with their ways in the waste land
 and having put to destruction seven nations in the land of canaan he gave them the land for their heritage for about four hundred and fifty years
 and after these things he gave them judges till the time of samuel the prophet
 then at their request for a king god gave them saul the son of kish a man of the family of benjamin who was their king for forty years
 and having put him on one side he made david their king to whom he gave witness saying i have taken david the son of jesse a man dear to my heart who will do all my pleasure
 from this mans seed has god given to israel a saviour even jesus as he gave his word
 for whose coming john made ready the way by preaching to all the people of israel the baptism which goes with a change of heart
 and when john was completing his work he said what do i seem to you to be i am not he but one is coming after me whose shoes i am not good enough to undo
 my brothers children of the family of abraham and those among you who have the fear of god to us the word of this salvation is sent
 for the men of jerusalem and their rulers having no knowledge of him or of the sayings of the prophets which come to their ears every sabbath day gave effect to them by judging him
 and though no cause of death was seen in him they made a request to pilate that he might be put to death
 and when they had done all the things said in the writings about him they took him down from the tree and put him in the place of the dead
 but god gave him back from the dead
 and for a number of days he was seen by those who came with him from galilee to jerusalem who are now his witnesses before the people
 and we are giving you the good news of the undertaking made to the fathers
 which god has now put into effect for our children by sending jesus as it says in the second psalm you are my son this day i have given you being
 and about his coming back from the dead never again to go to destruction he has said these words i will give you the holy and certain mercies of david
 because he says in another psalm you will not let your holy one see destruction
 now david having done gods work for his generation went to sleep and was put with his fathers and his body came to destruction
 but he who was lifted up by god did not see destruction
 and so let it be clear to you my brothers that through this man forgiveness of sins is offered to you
 and through him everyone who has faith is made free from all those things from which the law of moses was not able to make you free
 so take care that these words of the prophets do not come true for you
 see you doubters have wonder and come to your end for i will do a thing in your days to which you will not give belief even if it is made clear to you
 and when they went out they made a request that these words might be said to them again on the sabbath after
 now when the meeting was ended a number of the jews and of the god fearing gentiles who had become jews went after paul and barnabas who put before them how important it was to keep on in the grace of god
 and on the sabbath after almost all the town came together to give hearing to the word of god
 but when the jews saw such a great number of people they were full of envy and said evil words against pauls preaching
 then paul and barnabas without fear said it was necessary for the word of god to be given to you first but because you will have nothing to do with it and have no desire for eternal life it will now be offered to the gentiles
 for so the lord has given us orders saying i have given you for a light to the gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth
 and the gentiles hearing this were glad and gave glory to the word of god and those marked out by god for eternal life had faith
 and the word of the lord went through all the country
 but the jews working up the feelings of the god fearing women of high position and of the chief men of the town got an attack started against paul and barnabas driving them out of those parts
 but they shaking off the dust of that place from their feet came to iconium
 and the disciples were full of joy and of the holy spirit
 now in iconium they went together to the synagogue of the jews and gave such teaching that a great number of jews and greeks had faith
 but those jews who had not the faith made the minds of the gentiles bitter against the brothers
 so they kept there for a long time taking heart in the lord who gave witness to the word of his grace by causing signs and wonders to be done by their hands
 but there was a division among the people of the town some were on the side of the jews and some on the side of the apostles
 and when a violent attempt was made by the gentiles and the jews with their rulers to make an attack on them and have them stoned
 having got news of it they went in flight to the towns of lycaonia lystra and derbe and the country round about
 and went on preaching the good news there
 and at lystra there was a certain man who from birth had been without the use of his feet never having had the power of walking
 this man was giving ear to the preaching of paul who looking at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well
 said in a loud voice get up on your feet and jumping up he went walking about
 and when the people saw what paul had done they said in a loud voice in the language of lycaonia the gods have come down to us in the form of men
 and they gave the name of jupiter to barnabas and to paul that of mercury because he was the chief talker
 and the priest of the image of jupiter which was before the town took oxen and flowers to the doors of the town and was about to make an offering with the people
 but when this came to the ears of the apostles paul and barnabas they went running out among the people parting their clothing and crying out
 good people why are you doing these things we are men with the same feelings as you and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living god who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them
 who in the past let all nations go in the ways which seemed good to them
 but he was not without witness because he did good and gave you rain from heaven and times of fruit making your hearts full of food and joy
 and even with these words it was hard for them to keep the people from making an offering to them
 but some jews came to that place from antioch and iconium and got control over the people and after stoning paul they had him pulled out of the town taking him for dead
 but when the disciples came round him he got up and went into the town and the day after he went away with barnabas to derbe
 and having made a number of disciples through the preaching of the good news in that town they went back to lystra and iconium and antioch
 making strong the souls of the disciples saying to them that they were to keep the faith and that we have to go through troubles of all sorts to come into the kingdom of god
 and when they had made selection of some to be rulers in every church and had given themselves to prayer and kept themselves from food they put them into the care of the lord in whom they had faith
 and they went through pisidia and came to pamphylia
 and after preaching the word in perga they went down to attalia
 and from there they went by ship to antioch where they had been handed over to the grace of god for the work which they had not done
 and when they came there and had got the church together they gave them an account of all the things which god had done through them and how he had made open a door of faith to the gentiles
 and they were with the disciples there for a long time
 now certain men came down from judaea teaching the brothers and saying that without circumcision after the rule of moses there is no salvation
 and after paul and barnabas had had no little argument and discussion with them the brothers made a decision to send paul and barnabas and certain others of them to the apostles and the rulers of the church at jerusalem about this question
 so they being sent on their way by the church went through phoenicia and samaria giving news of the salvation of the gentiles to the great joy of all the brothers
 and when they came to jerusalem they had a meeting with the church and the apostles and the rulers and they gave an account of all the things which god had done through them
 but some of the pharisees who were of the faith got up and said it is necessary for these to have circumcision and to keep the law of moses
 and the apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question
 and when there had been much discussion peter got up and said to them my brothers you have knowledge that some time back it was gods pleasure that by my mouth the good news might be given to the gentiles so that they might have faith
 and god the searcher of hearts was a witness to them giving them the holy spirit even as he did to us
 making no division between them and us but making clean their hearts by faith
 why then are you testing god by putting on the neck of the disciples a yoke so hard that not even our fathers or we were strong enough for it
 but we have faith that we will get salvation through the grace of the lord jesus in the same way as they
 and all the people were quiet while barnabas and paul gave an account of the signs and wonders which god had done among the gentiles by them
 and when they had come to an end james answering said my brothers give ear to me
 symeon has given an account of how god was first pleased to take from among the gentiles a people for himself
 and this is in agreement with the words of the prophets as it is said
 after these things i will come back and will put up the tent of david which has been broken down building up again its broken parts and making it complete
 so that the rest of men may make search for the lord and all the gentiles on whom my name is named
 says the lord who has made these things clear from the earliest times
 for this reason my decision is that we do not put trouble in the way of those who from among the gentiles are turned to god
 but that we give them orders to keep themselves from things offered to false gods and from the evil desires of the body and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law and from blood
 for moses from times long past has his preachers in every town reading his law in the synagogues every sabbath
 then it seemed good to the apostles and the rulers and all the church to send men from among them to antioch with paul and barnabas judas named barsabbas and silas chief men among the brothers
 and they sent a letter by them saying the apostles and the older brothers to the brothers who are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia may joy be with you
 because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words putting your souls in doubt to whom we gave no such order
 it seemed good to us having come to an agreement together to send these men to you with our well loved barnabas and paul
 men who have given up their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
 and so we have sent judas and silas who will say the same things to you themselves by word of mouth
 for it seemed good to the holy spirit and to us to put on you nothing more than these necessary things
 to keep from things offered to false gods and from blood and from things put to death in ways which are against the law and from the evil desires of the body if you keep yourselves from these you will do well may you be happy
 so they being sent away came down to antioch and having got the people together they gave them the letter
 and after reading it they were glad of its comfort
 and judas and silas who themselves were prophets gave teaching to the brothers and made them strong in the faith
 and when they had been there for some time they were sent back in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them
   
 but paul and barnabas kept on in antioch teaching and preaching the word of god with a number of others
 and after some days paul said to barnabas let us go back and see the brothers in every town where we have given the word of god and see how they are
 and barnabas had a desire to take with them john named mark
 but paul was of the opinion that it was not right to take with them one who had gone away from them in pamphylia and had not gone on with the work
 and there was a sharp argument between them so that they were parted from one another and barnabas took mark with him and went by ship to cyprus
 but paul took silas and went away with the blessing of the brothers
 and he went through syria and cilicia making the churches stronger in the faith
 and he came to derbe and lystra and there was a certain disciple there named timothy whose mother was one of the jews of the faith but his father was a greek
 of whom the brothers at lystra and iconium had a high opinion
 paul had a desire for him to go with him and he gave him circumcision because of the jews who were in those parts for they all had knowledge that his father was a greek
 and on their way through the towns they gave them the rules which had been made by the apostles and the rulers of the church at jerusalem so that they might keep them
 so the churches were made strong in the faith and were increased in number every day
 and after they had gone through the land of phrygia and galatia the holy spirit did not let them take the word into asia
 and having come to mysia they made an attempt to go into bithynia but the spirit of jesus did not let them
 and going past mysia they came down to troas
 and paul had a vision in the night a man of macedonia came requesting him and saying come over into macedonia and give us help
 and when he had seen the vision straight away we made the decision to go into macedonia for it seemed certain to us that god had sent us to give the good news to them
 so from troas we went straight by ship to samothrace and the day after to neapolis
 and from there to philippi which is the most important town of macedonia and a roman colony and we were there for some days
 and on the sabbath we went outside the town by the river where we had an idea that there would be a place of prayer and being seated we had talk with the women who had come together
 and a certain woman named lydia a trader in purple cloth of the town of thyatira and a god fearing woman gave ear to us whose heart the lord made open to give attention to the things which paul was saying
 and when she and her family had had baptism she made a request to us saying if it seems to you that i am true to the lord come into my house and be my guests and she made us come
 and when we were going to the place of prayer we came across a girl with a spirit which gave knowledge of the future whose masters made great profit from her power
 she came after paul and us crying out and saying these men are the servants of the most high god who are giving you news of the way of salvation
 and this she did on a number of days but paul was greatly troubled and turning said to the spirit i give you orders in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and it came out that very hour
 but when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone they took paul and silas pulling them into the market place before the rulers
 and when they had taken them before the authorities they said these men who are jews are greatly troubling our town
 teaching rules of living which it is not right for us to have or to keep being romans
 and the people made an attack on them all together and the authorities took their clothing off them and gave orders for them to be whipped
 and when they had given them a great number of blows they put them in prison giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely
 and he having such orders put them into the inner prison with chains on their feet
 but about the middle of the night paul and silas were making prayers and songs to god in the hearing of the prisoners
 and suddenly there was an earth shock so that the base of the prison was moved and all the doors came open and everyones chains came off
 and the keeper coming out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open took his sword and was about to put himself to death fearing that the prisoners had got away
 but paul said in a loud voice do yourself no damage for we are all here
 and he sent for lights and came rushing in and shaking with fear went down on his face before paul and silas
 and took them out and said sirs what have i to do to get salvation
 and they said have faith in the lord jesus and you and your family will have salvation
 and they gave the word of the lord to him and to all who were in his house
 and that same hour of the night he took them and when he had given attention to their wounds he and all his family had baptism straight away
 and he took them into his house and gave them food and he was full of joy having faith in god with all his family
 but when it was day the authorities sent the police saying let these men go
 and the keeper said to paul the authorities have given orders to let you go come out now and go in peace
 but paul said to them they have given us who are romans a public whipping without judging us and have put us in prison will they now send us out secretly no truly let them come themselves and take us out
 and the police gave an account of these words to the authorities and they were full of fear on hearing that they were romans
 then they came and made prayers to them requesting them when they had taken them out to go away from the town
 and they came out of the prison and went to the house of lydia and when they had seen the brothers they gave them comfort and went away
 now when they had gone through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews
 and paul as he generally did went in to them and on three sabbath days had discussions with them from the holy writings
 saying to them clearly and openly that christ had to be put to death and come back to life again and that this jesus whom he said i am preaching to you is the christ
 and some of them had faith and were joined to paul and silas and a number of the god fearing greeks and some of the chief women
 but the jews being moved with envy took with them certain low persons from among the common people and getting together a great number of people made an outcry in the town attacking the house of jason with the purpose of taking them out to the people
 and when they were not able to get them they took jason and some of the brothers by force before the rulers of the town crying these men who have made trouble all over the world have now come here
 whom jason has taken into his house and they are acting against the orders of caesar saying that there is another king jesus
 and hearing these things the people and the rulers of the town were troubled
 and having made jason and the others give an undertaking to keep the peace they let them go
 and the brothers straight away sent paul and silas away by night to beroea and they when they came there went to the synagogue of the jews
 now these were more noble than the jews of thessalonica for they gave serious attention to the word searching in the holy writings every day to see if these things were so
 and a number of them had faith and no small number of the greek women of high position and of the men
 but when the jews of thessalonica had news that paul was preaching the word at beroea they came there troubling the people and working them up
 so the brothers sent paul straight away to the sea but silas and timothy kept there still
 but those who went with paul took him as far as athens and then went away with orders from him to silas and timothy to come to him quickly
 now while paul was waiting for them at athens his spirit was troubled for he saw all the town full of images of the gods
 so he had discussions in the synagogue with the jews and god fearing gentiles and every day in the market place with those who were there
 and some of those who were supporters of the theories of the epicureans and the stoics had a meeting with him and some said what is this talker of foolish words saying and others he seems to be a preacher of strange gods because he was preaching of jesus and his coming back from the dead
 and they took him to mars hill saying will you make clear to us what is this new teaching of yours
 for you seem to us to say strange things and we have a desire to get the sense of them
  now all the athenians and the men from other lands who come there were giving all their time to talking or hearing of anything new 
 and paul got to his feet on mars hill and said o men of athens i see that you are overmuch given to fear of the gods
 for when i came by i was looking at the things to which you give worship and i saw an altar with this writing on it to the god of whom there is no knowledge now what you without knowledge give worship to i make clear to you
 the god who made the earth and everything in it he being lord of heaven and earth is not housed in buildings made with hands
 and he is not dependent on the work of mens hands as if he had need of anything for he himself gives to all life and breath and all things
 and he has made of one blood all the nations of men living on all the face of the earth ordering their times and the limits of their lands
 so that they might make search for god in order if possible to get knowledge of him and make discovery of him though he is not far from every one of us
 for in him we have life and motion and existence as certain of your verse writers have said for we are his offspring
 if then we are the offspring of god it is not right for us to have the idea that god is like gold or silver or stone formed by the art or design of man
 those times when men had no knowledge were overlooked by god but now he gives orders to all men in every place to undergo a change of heart
 because a day has been fixed in which all the world will be judged in righteousness by the man who has been marked out by him for this work of which he has given a sign to all men by giving him back from the dead
 now on hearing about the coming back from death some of them made sport of it but others said let us go more fully into this another time
 and so paul went away from among them
 but some men gave him their support among whom was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them
 after these things he went away from athens and came to corinth
 and there he came across a certain jew named aquila a man of pontus by birth who not long before had come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had given orders that all jews were to go away from rome and he came to them
 and because he was of the same trade he was living with them and they did their work together for by trade they were tent makers
 and every sabbath he had discussions in the synagogue turning jews and greeks to the faith
 and when silas and timothy came down from macedonia paul was completely given up to the word preaching to the jews that the christ was jesus
 and when they put themselves against him and said evil words he said shaking his clothing your blood be on your heads i am clean from now i will go to the gentiles
 and moving from there he went into the house of a man named titus justus a god fearing man whose house was very near the synagogue
 and crispus the ruler of the synagogue with all his family had faith in the lord and a great number of the people of corinth hearing the word had faith and were given baptism
 and the lord said to paul in the night in a vision have no fear and go on preaching
 for i am with you and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage for i have a number of people in this town
 and he was there for a year and six months teaching the word of god among them
 but when gallio was ruler of achaia all the jews together made an attack on paul and took him to the judges seat
 saying this man is teaching the people to give worship to god in a way which is against the law
 but when paul was about to say something gallio said to the jews if this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing
 but if it is a question of words or names or of your law see to it yourselves i will not be a judge of such things
 and he sent them away from the judges seat
 and they all made an attack on sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and gave him blows before the judges seat but gallio gave no attention to these things
 and paul after waiting some days went away from the brothers and went by ship to syria priscilla and aquila being with him and he had had his hair cut off in cenchrea for he had taken an oath
 and they came down to ephesus and he left them there and he himself went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the jews
 and being requested by them to be there for a longer time he said no
 and went from them saying i will come back to you if god lets me and he took ship from ephesus
 and when he had come to land at caesarea he went to see the church and then went down to antioch
 and having been there for some time he went through the country of galatia and phrygia in order making the disciples strong in the faith
 now a certain jew named apollos an alexandrian by birth and a man of learning came to ephesus and he had great knowledge of the holy writings
 this man had been trained in the way of the lord and burning in spirit he gave himself up to teaching the facts about jesus though he had knowledge only of johns baptism
 and he was preaching in the synagogue without fear but priscilla and aquila hearing his words took him in and gave him fuller teaching about the way of god
 and when he had a desire to go over into achaia the brothers gave him help and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them and when he had come he gave much help to those who had faith through grace
 for he overcame the jews in public discussion making clear from the holy writings that the christ was jesus
 and it came about that while apollos was at corinth paul having gone through the higher country came to ephesus where there were certain disciples
 and he said to them did you get the holy spirit when you had faith and they said to him no we have had no knowledge of the holy spirit
 and he said what sort of baptism did you have and they said the baptism of john
 and paul said john gave a baptism which goes with a change of heart saying to the people that they were to have faith in him who was coming after him that is in jesus
 and hearing this they had baptism in the name of the lord jesus
 and when paul had put his hands on them the holy spirit came on them and they had the power of talking in tongues and acting like prophets
 and there were about twelve of these men
 and he went into the synagogue and for three months he was preaching there without fear reasoning and teaching about the kingdom of god
 but because some of the people were hard hearted and would not give hearing saying evil words about the way before the people he went away from them and kept the disciples separate reasoning every day in the school of tyrannus
 and this went on for two years so that all those who were living in asia had knowledge of the word of the lord greeks as well as jews
 and god did special works of power by the hands of paul
 so that bits of linen and clothing from his body were taken to people who were ill and their diseases went away from them and the evil spirits went out
 but some of the jews who went from place to place driving out evil spirits took it on themselves to make use of the name of the lord jesus over those who had evil spirits saying i give you orders by jesus whom paul is preaching
 and there were seven sons of a man named sceva a jew and a chief priest who did this
 and the evil spirit answering said to them i have knowledge of jesus and of paul but who are you
 and the man in whom the evil spirit was jumping on them was stronger than the two of them and overcame them so that they went running from that house wounded and without their clothing
 and this came to the ears of all those jews and greeks who were living at ephesus and fear came on them all and the name of the lord jesus was made great
 and a number of those who had faith came and made a public statement of their sins and all their acts
 and a great number of those who were experts in strange arts took their books and put them on the fire in front of everyone and when the books were valued they came to fifty thousand bits of silver
 so the word of the lord was increased very greatly and was full of power
 now after these things were ended paul came to a decision that when he had gone through macedonia and achaia he would go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i have a desire to see rome
 and having sent two of his helpers timothy and erastus into macedonia he himself went on living in asia for a time
 and about that time a great outcry took place about the way
 for there was a certain man named demetrius a silver worker who made silver boxes for the images of diana and gave no small profit to the workmen
 whom he got together with other workmen of the same trade and said to them men it is clear that from this business we get our wealth
 and you see for it has come to your ears that not only at ephesus but almost all through asia this paul has been teaching numbers of people and turning them away saying that those are not gods who are made by mens hands
 and there is danger not only that our trade may be damaged in the opinion of men but that the holy place of the great goddess diana may be no longer honoured and that she to whom all asia and the world give worship will be put down from her high position
 and hearing this they were very angry crying out and saying great is diana of ephesus
 and the town was full of noise and trouble and they all came running into the theatre having taken by force gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia who were journeying in company with paul
 and when paul was about to go in to the people the disciples did not let him
 and some of the rulers of asia being his friends sent to him requesting him seriously not to put himself in danger by going into the theatre
 and some said one thing and some another for there was no order in the meeting and most of them had no idea why they had come together
 then they took alexander out from among the people the jews putting him forward and alexander making a sign with his hand was about to make a statement to the people in answer
 but when they saw that he was a jew all of them with one voice went on crying out for about two hours great is diana of ephesus
 and when the chief secretary had got the people quiet he said men of ephesus is any man without knowledge that the town of ephesus is the keeper of the holy place of the great diana who was sent down from jupiter
 so then because these things may not be doubted it would be better for you to be quiet and do nothing unwise
 for you have taken these men who are not doing damage to the holy place or talking against our goddess
 if then demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man the law is open to them and there are judges let them put up a cause at law against one another
 but if any other business is in question let it be taken up in the regular meeting
 for truly we are in danger of being made responsible for this days trouble there being no cause for it and we are not able to give any reason for this coming together
 and when he had said this he sent the meeting away
 and when the day of pentecost was come they were all together in one place
 and suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind and all the house where they were was full of it
 and they saw tongues like flames of fire coming to rest on every one of them
 and they were all full of the holy spirit and were talking in different languages as the spirit gave them power
 now there were living at jerusalem jews god fearing men from every nation under heaven
 and when this sound came to their ears they all came together and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language
 and they were full of wonder and said are not all these men galilaeans
 and how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth
 men of parthia media and elam and those living in mesopotamia in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia
 in phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and the parts of libya about cyrene and those who have come from rome jews by birth and others who have become jews
 men of crete and arabia to all of us they are talking in our different languages of the great works of god
 and they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another what is the reason of this
 but others making sport of them said they are full of new wine
 but peter getting up with the eleven said in a loud voice o men of judaea and all you who are living in jerusalem take note of this and give ear to my words
 for these men are not overcome with wine as it seems to you for it is only the third hour of the day
 but this is the thing which was said by the prophet joel
 and it will come about in the last days says god that i will send out my spirit on all flesh and your sons and your daughters will be prophets and your young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams
 and on my men servants and my women servants i will send my spirit and they will be prophets
 and wonders will be seen in heaven and signs on the earth blood and fire and smoke
 the sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood before that great day of the lord comes in glory
 and whoever makes his prayer to the lord will have salvation
 men of israel give ear to these words jesus of nazareth a man who had the approval of god as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which god did by him among you as you yourselves have knowledge
 him when he was given up by the decision and knowledge of god you put to death on the cross by the hands of evil men
 but god gave him back to life having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it
 for david said of him i saw the lord before my face at all times for he is at my right hand so that i may not be moved
 and for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy and my flesh will be resting in hope
 for you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your holy one to destruction
 you have made me see the ways of life i will be full of joy when i see your face
 my brothers i may say to you openly that david came to his death and was put in the earth and his resting place is with us today
 but being a prophet and having in mind the oath which god had given to him that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king
 he having knowledge of the future was talking of the coming again of christ from the dead that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction
 this jesus god has given back to life of which we all are witnesses
 and so being lifted up to the right hand of god and having the fathers word that the holy spirit would come he has sent this thing which now you see and have knowledge of
 for david has not gone up into heaven but says himself the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand
 till i put all those who are against you under your feet
 for this reason let all israel be certain that this jesus whom you put to death on the cross god has made lord and christ
 now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled and they said to peter and the other apostles brothers what are we to do
 and peter said let your hearts be changed every one of you and have baptism in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will have the holy spirit given to you
 for the word of god is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off even all those who may be marked out by the lord our god
 and with more such words he gave his witness offering them salvation and saying come out from this evil generation
 then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day
 and they kept their attention fixed on the apostles teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer
 but fear came on every soul and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the apostles
 and all those who were of the faith kept together and had all things in common
 and exchanging their goods and property for money they made division of it among them all as they had need
 and day by day going in agreement together regularly to the temple and taking broken bread together in their houses they took their food with joy and with true hearts
 giving praise to god and having the approval of all the people and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the lord
 and after the noise had come to an end paul having sent for the disciples and given them comfort went away from them to macedonia
 and when he had gone through those parts and given them much teaching he came into greece
 and when he had been there three months because the jews had made a secret design against him when he was about to take ship for syria he made a decision to go back through macedonia
 and sopater of beroea the son of pyrrhus and aristarchus and secundus of thessalonica and gaius of derbe and timothy and tychicus and trophimus of asia went with him as far as asia
 but these had gone before and were waiting for us at troas
 and we went away from philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread and came to them at troas in five days and we were there for seven days
 and on the first day of the week when we had come together for the holy meal paul gave them a talk for it was his purpose to go away on the day after and he went on talking till after the middle of the night
 and there were a number of lights in the room where we had come together
 and a certain young man named eutychus who was seated in the window went into a deep sleep and while paul went on talking being overcome by sleep he had a fall from the third floor and was taken up dead
 and paul went down and falling on him took him in his arms and said do not be troubled for his life is in him
 and when he had gone up and had taken the broken bread he went on talking to them for a long time even till dawn and then he went away
 and they took the boy in living and were greatly comforted
 but we going before him by ship went to assos with the purpose of taking paul in there for so he had given orders because he himself was coming by land
 and when he came up with us at assos we took him in the ship and went on to mitylene
 and going from there by sea we came on the day after opposite chios and touching at samos on the day after that we came on the third day to miletus
 for pauls purpose was to go past ephesus so that he might not be kept in asia for he was going quickly in order if possible to be at jerusalem on the day of pentecost
 and from miletus he sent to ephesus for the rulers of the church
 and when they had come he said to them you yourselves have seen what my life has been like all the time from the day when i first came into asia
 doing the lords work without pride through all the sorrow and troubles which came on me because of the evil designs of the jews
 and how i kept back nothing which might be of profit to you teaching you publicly and privately
 preaching to jews and to greeks the need for a turning of the heart to god and faith in the lord jesus christ
 and now as you see i am going to jerusalem a prisoner in spirit having no knowledge of what will come to me there
 only that the holy spirit makes clear to me in every town that prison and pains are waiting for me
 but i put no value on my life if only at the end of it i may see the work complete which was given to me by the lord jesus to be a witness of the good news of the grace of god
 and now i am conscious that you among whom i have gone about preaching the kingdom will not see my face again
 and so i say to you this day that i am clean from the blood of all men
 for i have not kept back from you anything of the purpose of god
 give attention to yourselves and to all the flock which the holy spirit has given into your care to give food to the church of god for which he gave his blood
 i am conscious that after i am gone evil wolves will come in among you doing damage to the flock
 and from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching turning away the disciples after them
 so keep watch having in mind that for three years without resting i was teaching every one of you day and night with weeping
 and now i give you into the care of god and the word of his grace which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints
 i have had no desire for any mans silver or gold or clothing
 you yourselves have seen that with these hands i got what was necessary for me and those who were with me
 in all things i was an example to you of how in your lives you are to give help to the feeble and keep in memory the words of the lord jesus how he himself said there is a greater blessing in giving than in getting
 and having said these words he went down on his knees in prayer with them all
 and they were all weeping falling on pauls neck and kissing him
 being sad most of all because he had said that they would not see his face again and so they went with him to the ship
 and after parting from them we put out to sea and came straight to cos and the day after to rhodes and from there to patara
 and as there was a ship going to phoenicia we went in it
 and when we had come in view of cyprus going past it on our left we went on to syria and came to land at tyre for there the goods which were in the ship had to be taken out
 and meeting the disciples we were there for seven days and they gave paul orders through the spirit not to go up to jerusalem
 and when these days came to an end we went on our journey and they all with their wives and children came with us on our way till we were out of the town and after going on our knees in prayer by the sea
 we said our last words to one another and got into the ship and they went back to their houses
 and journeying by ship from tyre we came to ptolemais and there we had talk with the brothers and were with them for one day
 and on the day after we went away and came to caesarea where we were guests in the house of philip the preacher who was one of the seven
 and he had four daughters virgins who were prophets
 and while we were waiting there for some days a certain prophet named agabus came down from judaea
 and he came to us and took the band of pauls clothing and putting it round his feet and hands said the holy spirit says these words so will the jews do to the man who is the owner of this band and they will give him up into the hands of the gentiles
 and hearing these things we and those who were living in that place made request to him not to go to jerusalem
 then paul said what are you doing weeping and wounding my heart for i am ready not only to be a prisoner but to be put to death at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
 and as he might not be moved we did no more saying let the purpose of god be done
 and after these days we got ready and went up to jerusalem
 and some of the disciples from caesarea went with us taking a certain mnason of cyprus one of the early disciples in whose house we were to be living
 and when we came to jerusalem the brothers were pleased to see us
 and on the day after paul went with us to james and all the rulers of the church were present
 and when he had said how glad he was to see them he gave them a detailed account of the things which god had done through his work among the gentiles
 and hearing it they gave praise to god and they said to him you see brother what thousands there are among the jews who have the faith and they all have a great respect for the law
 and they have had news of you how you have been teaching all the jews among the gentiles to give up the law of moses and not to give circumcision to their children and not to keep the old rules
 what then is the position they will certainly get news that you have come
 do this then which we say to you we have four men who have taken an oath
 go with these and make yourself clean with them and make the necessary payments for them so that they may be free from their oath and everyone will see that the statements made about you are not true but that you put yourself under rule and keep the law
 but as to the gentiles who have the faith we sent a letter giving our decision that they were to keep themselves from offerings made to false gods and from blood and from the flesh of animals put to death in ways against the law and from the evil desires of the body
 then paul took the men and on the day after making himself clean with them he went into the temple giving out the statement that the days necessary for making them clean were complete till the offering was made for every one of them
 and when the seven days were almost ended the jews from asia seeing him in the temple got the people together and put their hands on him
 crying out men of israel come to our help this is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place and in addition he has taken greeks into the temple and made this holy place unclean
 for they had seen him before in the town with trophimus of ephesus and had the idea that paul had taken him with him into the temple
 and all the town was moved and the people came running together and put their hands on paul pulling him out of the temple and then the doors were shut
 and while they were attempting to put him to death news came to the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was out of control
 and straight away he took some armed men and went quickly down to them and the jews seeing them gave no more blows to paul
 then the chief captain came near and took him and gave orders for him to be put in chains questioning them as to who he was and what he had done
 and some said one thing and some another among the people and as he was not able to get a knowledge of the facts because of the noise he gave orders for paul to be taken into the army building
 and when he came on to the steps he was lifted up by the armed men because of the force of the people
 for a great mass of people came after them crying out away with him 
 and when paul was about to be taken into the building he said to the chief captain may i say something to you and he said have you a knowledge of greek
 are you by chance the egyptian who before this got the people worked up against the government and took four thousand men of the assassins out into the waste land
 but paul said i am a jew of tarsus in cilicia which is not an unimportant town i make a request to you to let me say a word to the people
 and when he let him do so paul from the steps made a sign with his hand to the people and when they were all quiet he said to them in the hebrew language
 my brothers and fathers give ear to the story of my life which i now put before you
 and hearing him talking in the hebrew language they became the more quiet and he said
 i am a jew of tarsus in cilicia by birth but i had my education in this town at the feet of gamaliel being trained in the keeping of every detail of the law of our fathers given up to the cause of god with all my heart as you are today
 and i made attacks on this way even to death taking men and women and putting them in prison
 of which the high priest will be a witness and all the rulers from whom i had letters to the brothers and i went into damascus to take those who were there as prisoners to jerusalem for punishment
 and it came about that while i was on my journey coming near to damascus about the middle of the day suddenly i saw a great light from heaven shining round me
 and when i went down on the earth a voice came to my ears saying to me saul saul why are you attacking me so cruelly
 and i answering said who are you lord and he said to me i am jesus of nazareth whom you are attacking
 and those who were with me saw the light but the voice of him who was talking to me came not to their ears
 and i said what have i to do lord and the lord said to me get up and go into damascus and it will be made clear to you what you have to do
 and because i was unable to see because of the glory of that light those who were with me took me by the hand and so i came to damascus
 and one ananias a god fearing man who kept the law and of whom all the jews in that place had a high opinion
 came to my side and said brother saul let your eyes be open and in that very hour i was able to see him
 and he said you have been marked out by the god of our fathers to have knowledge of his purpose and to see the upright one and to give ear to the words of his mouth
 for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and of what has come to your ears
 and now why are you waiting get up and have baptism for the washing away of your sins giving worship to his name
 and it came about that when i had come back to jerusalem while i was at prayer in the temple my senses became more than naturally clear
 and i saw him saying to me go out of jerusalem straight away because they will not give hearing to your witness about me
 and i said lord they themselves have knowledge that i went through the synagogues putting in prison and whipping all those who had faith in you
 and when stephen your witness was put to death i was there giving approval and looking after the clothing of those who put him to death
 and he said to me go for i will send you far away to the gentiles
 and they gave him a hearing as far as this word then with loud voices they said away with this man from the earth it is not right for him to be living
 and while they were crying out and pulling off their clothing and sending dust into the air
 the chief captain gave orders for him to be taken into the army building saying that he would put him to the test by whipping so that he might have knowledge of the reason why they were crying out so violently against him
 and when they had put leather bands round him paul said to the captain who was present is it the law for you to give blows to a man who is a roman and has not been judged
 and hearing this the man went to the chief captain and gave him an account of it saying what are you about to do for this man is a roman
 and the chief captain came to him and said give me an answer are you a roman and he said yes
 and the chief captain said i got roman rights for myself at a great price and paul said but i had them by birth
 then those who were about to put him to the test went away and the chief captain was in fear seeing that he was a roman and that he had put chains on him
 but on the day after desiring to have certain knowledge of what the jews had to say against him he made him free and gave orders for the chief priests and all the sanhedrin to come together and he took paul and put him before them
 and paul looking fixedly at the sanhedrin said my brothers my life has been upright before god till this day
 and the high priest ananias gave orders to those who were near him to give him a blow on the mouth
 then paul said to him god will give blows to you you whitewashed wall are you here to be my judge by law and by your orders am i given blows against the law
 and those who were near said do you say such words against gods high priest
 and paul said brother i had no idea that he was the high priest for it has been said you may not say evil about the ruler of your people
 but when paul saw that half of them were sadducees and the rest pharisees he said in the sanhedrin brothers i am a pharisee and the son of pharisees i am here to be judged on the question of the hope of the coming back from the dead
 and when he had said this there was an argument between the pharisees and the sadducees and a division in the meeting
 for the sadducees say that there is no coming back from the dead and no angels or spirits but the pharisees have belief in all these
 and there was a great outcry and some of the scribes on the side of the pharisees got up and took part in the discussion saying we see no evil in this man what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit
 and when the argument became very violent the chief captain fearing that paul would be pulled in two by them gave orders to the armed men to take him by force from among them and take him into the army building
 and the night after the lord came to his side and said be of good heart for as you have been witnessing for me in jerusalem so will you be my witness in rome
 and when it was day the jews came together and put themselves under an oath that they would take no food or drink till they had put paul to death
 and more than forty of them took this oath
 and they came to the chief priests and the rulers and said we have taken a great oath to take no food till we have put paul to death
 so now will you and the sanhedrin make a request to the military authorities to have him sent down to you as if you were desiring to go into the business in greater detail and we before ever he gets to you will be waiting to put him to death
 but pauls sisters son had word of their design and he came into the army building and gave news of it to paul
 and paul sent for a captain and said take this young man to your chief for he has news for him
 so he took him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner made a request to me to take this young man to you for he has something to say to you
 and the chief took him by the hand and going on one side said to him privately what is it you have to say to me
 and he said the jews are in agreement together to make a request to you for paul to be taken on the day after this into the sanhedrin to be questioned in greater detail
 but do not give way to them for more than forty of them are waiting for him having taken an oath not to take food or drink till they have put him to death and now they are ready waiting for your order
 so the chief captain let the young man go saying to him do not say to anyone that you have given me word of these things
 and he sent for two captains and said make ready two hundred men with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to caesarea at the third hour of the night
 and get beasts so that they may put paul on them and take him safely to felix the ruler
 and he sent a letter in these words
 claudius lysias to the most noble ruler felix peace be with you
 this man was taken by the jews and was about to be put to death by them when i came on them with the army and took him out of danger having knowledge that he was a roman
 and desiring to get at the reason for their attack on him i took him down to their sanhedrin
 then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death
 and when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man i sent him straight away to you giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you
 so the armed men as they were ordered took paul and came by night to antipatris
 but on the day after they sent the horsemen on with him and went back to their place
 and they when they came to caesarea gave the letter to the ruler and took paul before him
 and after reading it he said what part of the country do you come from and hearing that he was from cilicia
 i will give hearing to your cause he said when those who are against you have come and he gave orders for him to be kept in herods praetorium
 and after five days the high priest ananias came with certain of the rulers and an expert talker one tertullus and they made a statement to felix against paul
 and when he had been sent for tertullus starting his statement said because by you we are living in peace and through your wisdom wrongs are put right for this nation
 in all things and in all places we are conscious of our great debt to you most noble felix
 but so that i may not make you tired i make a request to you of your mercy to give hearing to a short statement
 for this man in our opinion is a cause of trouble a maker of attacks on the government among jews through all the empire and a chief mover in the society of the nazarenes
 who in addition was attempting to make the temple unclean whom we took
   
 and from whom you will be able by questioning him yourself to get knowledge of all the things which we say against him
 and the jews were in agreement with his statement saying that these things were so
 then when the ruler had given him a sign to make his answer paul said because i have knowledge that you have been a judge over this nation for a number of years i am glad to make my answer
 seeing that you are able to make certain of the fact that it is not more than twelve days from the time when i came up to jerusalem for worship
 and they have not seen me in argument with any man in the temple or working up the feelings of the people in the synagogues or in the town
 and they are not able to give facts in support of the things which they say against me now
 but this i will say openly to you that i do give worship to the god of our fathers after that way which to them is not the true religion but i have belief in all the things which are in the law and in the books of the prophets
 hoping in god for that which they themselves are looking for that there will be a coming back from the dead for upright men and wrongdoers
 and in this i do my best at all times to have no reason for shame before god or men
 now after a number of years i came to give help and offerings to my nation
 and having been made clean i was in the temple but not with a great number of people and not with noise but there were certain jews from asia
 and it would have been better if they had come here to make a statement if they have anything against me
 or let these men here present say what wrongdoing was seen in me when i was before the sanhedrin
 but only this one thing which i said among them in a loud voice i am this day being judged on the question of the coming back from the dead
 but felix who had a more detailed knowledge of the way put them off saying when lysias the chief captain comes down i will give attention to your business
 and he gave orders to the captain to keep paul under his control and to let him have everything he had need of and not to keep his friends from coming to see him
 but after some days felix came with drusilla his wife who was of the jews by birth and sent for paul and gave hearing to him about faith in christ jesus
 and while he was talking about righteousness and self control and the judging which was to come felix had great fear and said go away for the present and when the right time comes i will send for you
 for he was hoping that paul would give him money so he sent for him more frequently and had talk with him
 but after two years porcius festus took the place of felix who desiring to have the approval of the jews kept paul in chains
 so festus having come into that part of the country which was under his rule after three days went up to jerusalem from caesarea
 and the chief priests and the chief men of the jews made statements against paul
 requesting festus to give effect to their design against him and send him to jerusalem when they would be waiting to put him to death on the way
 but festus in answer said that paul was being kept in prison at caesarea and that in a short time he himself was going there
 so he said let those who have authority among you go with me and if there is any wrong in the man let them make a statement against him
 and when he had been with them not more than eight or ten days he went down to caesarea and on the day after he took his place on the judges seat and sent for paul
 and when he came the jews who had come down from jerusalem came round him and made all sorts of serious statements against him which were not supported by the facts
 then paul in his answer to them said i have done no wrong against the law of the jews or against the temple or against caesar
 but festus desiring to get the approval of the jews said to paul will you go up to jerusalem and be judged before me there in connection with these things
 and paul said i am before the seat of caesars authority where it is right for me to be judged i have done no wrong to the jews as you are well able to see
 if then i am a wrongdoer and there is a cause of death in me i am ready for death if it is not as they say against me no man may give me up to them let my cause come before caesar
 then festus having had a discussion with the jews made answer you have said let my cause come before caesar to caesar you will go
 now when some days had gone by king agrippa and bernice came to caesarea and went to see festus
 and as they were there for some days festus gave them pauls story saying there is a certain man here who was put in prison by felix
 against whom the chief priests and the rulers of the jews made a statement when i was at jerusalem requesting me to give a decision against him
 to whom i gave answer that it is not the roman way to give a man up till he has been face to face with those who are attacking him and has had a chance to give an answer to the statements made against him
 so when they had come together here straight away on the day after i took my place on the judges seat and sent for the man
 but when they got up they said nothing about such crimes as i had in mind
 but had certain questions against him in connection with their religion and about one jesus now dead who paul said was living
 and as i had not enough knowledge for the discussion of these things i made the suggestion to him to go to jerusalem and be judged there
 but when paul made a request that he might be judged by caesar i gave orders for him to be kept till i might send him to caesar
 and agrippa said to festus i have a desire to give the man a hearing myself tomorrow he said you may give him a hearing
 so on the day after when agrippa and bernice in great glory had come into the public place of hearing with the chief of the army and the chief men of the town at the order of festus paul was sent for
 and festus said king agrippa and all those who are present here with us you see this man about whom all the jews have made protests to me at jerusalem and in this place saying that it is not right for him to be living any longer
 but in my opinion there is no cause of death in him and as he himself has made a request to be judged by caesar i have said that i would send him
 but i have no certain account of him to send to caesar so i have sent for him to come before you and specially before you king agrippa so that after the business has been gone into i may have something to put in writing
 for it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him
 and agrippa said to paul you may put your cause before us then paul stretching out his hand made his answer saying
 in my opinion i am happy king agrippa to be able to give my answer before you today to all these things which the jews say against me
 the more so because you are expert in all questions to do with the jews and their ways so i make my request to you to give me a hearing to the end
 all the jews have knowledge of my way of life from my early years as it was from the start among my nation and at jerusalem
 and they are able to say if they would give witness that i was living as a pharisee in that division of our religion which is most regular in the keeping of the law
 and now i am here to be judged because of the hope given by gods word to our fathers
 for the effecting of which our twelve tribes have been working and waiting night and day with all their hearts and in connection with this hope i am attacked by the jews o king 
 why in your opinion is it outside belief for god to make the dead come to life again
 for i truly was of the opinion that it was right for me to do a number of things against the name of jesus of nazareth
 and this i did in jerusalem and numbers of the saints i put in prison having had authority given to me from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my decision against them
 and i gave them punishment frequently in all the synagogues forcing them to say things against god and burning with passion against them i went after them even into far away towns
 then when i was journeying to damascus with the authority and orders of the chief priests
 in the middle of the day on the road i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun shining round me and those who were journeying with me
 and when we had all gone down on the earth a voice came to me saying in the hebrew language saul saul why are you attacking me so cruelly it is hard for you to go against the impulse which is driving you
 and i said who are you lord and the lord said i am jesus whom you are attacking
 but get up on your feet for i have come to you for this purpose to make you a servant and a witness of the things in which you have seen me and of those in which you will see me
 and i will keep you safe from the people and from the gentiles to whom i send you
 to make their eyes open turning them from the dark to the light and from the power of satan to god so that they may have forgiveness of sins and a heritage among those who are made holy by faith in me
 so then king agrippa i did not go against the vision from heaven
 but i went about first to those in damascus and jerusalem and through all the country of judaea and then to the gentiles preaching a change of heart so that they being turned to god might give in their works the fruits of a changed heart
 for this reason the jews took me in the temple and made an attempt to put me to death
 and so by gods help i am here today witnessing to small and great saying nothing but what the prophets and moses said would come about
 that the christ would go through pain and being the first to come back from the dead would give light to the people and to the gentiles
 and when he made his answer in these words festus said in a loud voice paul you are off your head your great learning has made you unbalanced
 then paul said i am not off my head most noble festus but my words are true and wise
 for the king has knowledge of these things to whom i am talking freely being certain that all this is common knowledge to him for it has not been done in secret
 king agrippa have you faith in the prophets i am certain that you have
 and agrippa said to paul a little more and you will be making me a christian
 and paul said it is my prayer to god that in little or great measure not only you but all those hearing me today might be even as i am but for these chains
 and the king and the ruler and bernice and those who were seated with them got up
 and when they had gone away they said to one another this man has done nothing which might give cause for death or prison
 and agrippa said to festus this man might have been made free if he had not put his cause before caesar
 and when the decision had been made that we were to go by sea to italy they gave paul and certain other prisoners into the care of a captain named julius of the augustan band
 and we went to sea in a ship of adramyttium which was sailing to the sea towns of asia aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us
 and on the day after we came to sidon and julius was kind to paul and let him go to see his friends and take a rest
 and sailing again from there we went on under cover of cyprus because the wind was against us
 and having gone across the sea off cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra in lycia
 and there the captain came across a ship of alexandria sailing for italy and put us in it
 and when we had gone on slowly for a long time and had had hard work getting across to cnidus for the wind was against us we went under cover of crete in the direction of salmone
 and sailing down the side of it as well as we were able we came to a certain place named fair havens near which was the town of lasea
 and as a long time had gone by and the journey was now full of danger because it was late in the year paul put the position before them
 saying friends i see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss not only to the goods and the ship but to ourselves
 but the captain gave more attention to the master and the owner of the ship than to what paul said
 and as the harbour was not a good one in which to be for the winter the greater number of them were for going out to sea in order if possible to put in for the winter at phoenix a harbour of crete looking to the north east and south east
 and when the south wind came softly being of the opinion that their purpose might be effected they let the ship go and went sailing down the side of crete very near to the land
 but after a little time a very violent wind named euraquilo came down from it with great force
 and when the ship got into the grip of it and was not able to make headway into the wind we gave way and went before it
 and sailing near the side of a small island named cauda we were able though it was hard work to make the ships boat safe
 and having got it up they put cords under and round the ship but fearing that they might be pushed on to the syrtis they let down the sails and so went running before the wind
 and still fighting the storm with all our strength the day after they made a start at getting the goods out of the ship
 and on the third day they let all the sailing apparatus go over the side
 and as we had not seen the sun or stars for a long time and a great storm was on us all hope of salvation was gone
 and when they had been without food for a long time paul got up among them and said friends it would have been better if you had given attention to me and not gone sailing out from crete to undergo this damage and loss
 but now i say to you be of good heart for there will be no loss of life but only of the ship
 for this night there came to my side an angel of the god who is my master and whose servant i am
 saying have no fear paul for you will come before caesar and god has given to you all those who are sailing with you
 and so o men be of good heart for i have faith in god that it will be as he said to me
 but we will be sent on to a certain island
 but when the fourteenth day came while we were going here and there in the adriatic sea about the middle of the night the sailors had an idea that they were getting near land
 and they let down the lead and saw that the sea was a hundred and twenty feet deep and after a little time they did it again and it was ninety feet
 then fearing that by chance we might come on to the rocks they let down four hooks from the back of the ship and made prayers for the coming of day
 then the sailors made attempts secretly to get away from the ship letting down a boat as if they were about to put down hooks from the front of the ship
 but paul said to the captain and his men if you do not keep these men in the ship you will not be safe
 then the armed men cutting the cords of the boat let her go
 and when dawn was near paul gave them all orders to take food saying this is the fourteenth day you have been waiting and taking no food
 so i make request to you to take food for this is for your salvation not a hair from the head of any of you will come to destruction
 and when he had said this and had taken bread he gave praise to god before them all and took a meal of the broken bread
 then they all took heart and did the same
 and we were in the ship two hundred and seventy six persons
 and when they had had enough food they made the weight of the ship less turning the grain out into the sea
 and when it was day they had no knowledge of the land but they saw an inlet of the sea with a floor of sand and they had the idea of driving the ship up on to it if possible
 so cutting away the hooks and letting them go into the sea and freeing the cords of the guiding blades and lifting up the sail to the wind they went in the direction of the inlet
 and coming to a point between two seas they got the ship to land and the front part was fixed in the sand and not able to be moved but the back part was broken by the force of the waves
 then the armed men were for putting the prisoners to death so that no one would get away by swimming
 but the captain desiring to keep paul safe kept them from their purpose and gave orders that those who had knowledge of swimming were to go off the ship and get first to land
 and the rest some on boards and some on things from the ship and so it came about that they all got safe to land
 and when we were safe we made the discovery that the island was named melita
 and the simple people living there were uncommonly kind to us for they made a fire for us and took us in because it was raining and cold
 but when paul had got some sticks together and put them on the fire a snake came out because of the heat and gave him a bite on the hand
 and when the people saw it hanging on his hand they said to one another without doubt this man has put someone to death and though he has got safely away from the sea god will not let him go on living
 but shaking off the beast into the fire he got no damage
 but they had the idea that they would see him becoming ill or suddenly falling down dead but after waiting a long time and seeing that no damage came to him changing their opinion they said he was a god
 now near that place there was some land the property of the chief man of the island who was named publius who very kindly took us into his house as his guests for three days
 and the father of publius was ill with a disease of the stomach to whom paul went and put his hands on him with prayer and made him well
 and when this took place all the others in the island who had diseases came and were made well
 then they gave us great honour and when we went away they put into the ship whatever things we were in need of
 and after three months we went to sea in a ship of alexandria sailing under the sign of the dioscuri which had been at the island for the winter
 and going into the harbour at syracuse we were waiting there for three days
 and from there going about in a curve we came to rhegium and after one day a south wind came up and on the day after we came to puteoli
 where we came across some of the brothers who kept us with them for seven days and so we came to rome
 and the brothers when they had news of us came out from town as far as appii forum and the three taverns to have a meeting with us and paul seeing them gave praise to god and took heart
 and when we came into rome they let paul have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him
 then after three days he sent for the chief men of the jews and when they had come together he said to them my brothers though i had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers i was given a prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans
 who when they had put questions to me were ready to let me go free because there was no cause of death in me
 but when the jews made protest against it i had to put my cause into caesars hands not because i have anything to say against my nation
 but for this reason i sent for you to see and have talk with you for because of the hope of israel i am in these chains
 and they said to him we have not had letters from judaea about you and no one of the brothers has come to us here to give an account or say any evil about you
 but we have a desire to give hearing to your opinion for as to this form of religion we have knowledge that in all places it is attacked
 and when a day had been fixed they came to his house in great numbers and he gave them teaching giving witness to the kingdom of god and having discussions with them about jesus from the law of moses and from the prophets from morning till evening
 and some were in agreement with what he said but some had doubts
 and they went away for there was a division among them after paul had said this one thing well did the holy spirit say by the prophet isaiah to your fathers
 go to this people and say though you give ear you will not get knowledge and seeing you will see but the sense will not be clear to you
 for the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me so that i might make them well
 be certain then that the salvation of god is sent to the gentiles and they will give hearing
   
 and for the space of two years paul was living in the house of which he had the use and had talk with all those who went in to see him
 preaching the kingdom of god and teaching about the lord jesus christ without fear and no orders were given that he was not to do so
 now peter and john were going up to the temple at the ninth hour the hour of prayer
 and a certain man who from birth had had no power in his legs was taken there every day and put down at the door of the temple which is named beautiful requesting money from those who went into the temple
 he then seeing peter and john going into the temple made a request to them
 and peter looking at him with john said keep your eyes on us
 and he gave attention to them hoping to get something from them
 but peter said i have no silver or gold but what i have that i give to you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth get up on your feet
 and he took him by his right hand lifting him up and straight away his feet and the bones of his legs became strong
 and jumping up he got on to his feet and went into the temple with them walking and jumping and giving praise to god
 and all the people saw him walking and praising god
 and they saw that it was the man who made requests for money at the door of the temple and they were full of wonder and surprise at what had taken place
 and while he kept his hands on peter and john all the people came running together to the covered way which is named solomons full of wonder
 and when peter saw it he said to the people you men of israel why are you so greatly surprised at this man or why are you looking at us as if by our power or virtue we had given him the use of his legs
 the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers has given glory to his servant jesus whom you gave up turning your backs on him when pilate had made the decision to let him go free
 but you would have nothing to do with the holy and upright one and made request for a man of blood to be given to you
 and put to death the lord of life whom god gave back from the dead of which fact we are witnesses
 and his name through faith in his name has made this man strong whom you see and have knowledge of yes the faith which is through him has made him well before you all
 and now my brothers i am conscious that you did this as did your rulers without knowledge
 but the things which god had made clear before by the mouth of all the prophets that the christ would have to undergo he has put into effect in this way
 so then let your hearts be changed and be turned to god so that your sins may be completely taken away and times of blessing may come from the lord
 and that he may send the christ who was marked out for you from the first even jesus
 who is to be kept in heaven till the time when all things are put right of which god has given word by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from the earliest times
 for moses said the lord will give you a prophet from among your people like me you will give ear to everything which he will say to you
 and every soul who does not give attention to that prophet will be cut off from among the people
 and all the prophets from samuel and those who came after every one of them gave word of these days
 you are the sons of the prophets and of the agreement which god made with your fathers saying to abraham through your seed a blessing will come on all the families of the earth
 to you first god sent his servant blessing you by turning every one of you from his sins
 and while they were talking to the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came up to them
 being greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and preaching jesus as an example of the coming back from the dead
 and they took them and put them in prison till the morning for it was now evening
 but a number of those who gave hearing to the word had faith and they were now about five thousand
 and on the day after the rulers and those in authority and the scribes came together in jerusalem
 and annas the high priest was there and caiaphas and john and alexander and all the relations of the high priest
 then sending for peter and john they said by what power and in whose name have you done this
 then peter being full of the holy spirit said to them o you rulers of the people and men of authority
 if we are questioned today about a good work done to a man who was ill as to how he has been made well
 take note all of you and all the people of israel that in the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you put to death on the cross whom god gave back from the dead even through him is this man now before you completely well
 he is the stone which you builders had no use for but which has been made the chief stone of the building
 and in no other is there salvation for there is no other name under heaven given among men through which we may have salvation
 now when they saw that peter and john were without fear though they were men of no education or learning they were greatly surprised and they took note of them that they had been with jesus
 and seeing that the man who had been made well was there with them they were not able to say anything against it
 but when they had given them orders to go out of the sanhedrin they had a discussion among themselves
 saying what are we to do with these men for certainly it is clear to all who are living in jerusalem that a most important sign has been done by them and it is not possible to say that it is not so
 but so that it may not go farther among the people let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name
 and they sent for them and gave them orders not to make statements or give teaching in the name of jesus
 but peter and john in answer said to them it is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of god to give attention to you more than to god
 for it is not possible for us to keep from saying what we have seen and have knowledge of
 and when they had said more sharp words to them they let them go not seeing what punishment they might give them because of the people for all men were giving praise to god for what had taken place
 for the man on whom this act of power was done was more than forty years old
 and when they had been made free they came back to their friends and gave an account of all the things which the chief priests and the authorities had said to them
 and hearing it they all with one mind made prayer to god and said o lord maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them
 who has said by the holy spirit through the mouth of our father david your servant why are the nations so violently moved and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish
 the kings of the earth were lifted up the rulers came together against the lord and against his christ
 for truly in this town against your holy servant jesus who was marked out by you as christ herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel came together
 to do that which had been fixed before by your hand and your purpose
 and now lord take note of their cruel words and give your servants power to be preachers of your word without fear
 while your hand is stretched out to do works of mercy so that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy servant jesus
 and when their prayer was ended the place where they were was violently moved and they all became full of the holy spirit preaching the word of god without fear
 and all those who were of the faith were one in heart and soul and not one of them said that any of the things which he had was his property only but they had all things in common
 and with great power the apostles gave witness of the coming back of the lord jesus from the dead and grace was on them all
 and no one among them was in need for everyone who had land or houses exchanging them for money took the price of them
 and put it at the feet of the apostles for distribution to everyone as he had need
 and joseph who was given by the apostles the name of barnabas  the sense of which is son of comfort  a levite and a man of cyprus by birth
 having a field got money for it and put the money at the feet of the apostles
 but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife got money for his property
 and kept back part of the price his wife having knowledge of it and took the rest and put it at the feet of the apostles
 but peter said ananias why has the evil one put it into your heart to be false to the holy spirit and to keep back part of the price of the land
 while you had it was it not your property and after you had given it in exchange was it not still in your power how has this purpose come into your mind you have been false not to men but to god
 and at these words ananias went down on the earth and his life went from him and great fear came on all who were present
 and the young men went and made ready his body and took it out and put it in the earth
 and about three hours after his wife having no knowledge of what had taken place came in
 and peter said to her give me an answer was this amount of money the price of the land and she said yes it was
 but peter said to her why have you made an agreement together to be false to the spirit of the lord see the feet of the young men who have put the body of your husband in the earth are at the door and they will take you out
 and straight away she went down at his feet and her life went from her and the young men came in and saw her dead and they took her out and put her in the earth with her husband
 then great fear came on all the church and on all who had knowledge of these things
 now a number of signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles and they were all together in solomons covered way
 the others in fear kept back from joining them but the people made much of them
 and a great number of men and women had faith and were joined to the lord
 and they even took into the streets people who were ill and put them on beds so that when peter went by some of them might be in his shade
 and numbers of people came together from the towns round about jerusalem with those who were ill and those who were troubled with unclean spirits and they were all made well
 but the high priest and those who were with him  the sadducees  were full of envy
 and they took the apostles and put them in the common prison
 but in the night an angel of the lord opening the doors of the prison took them out and said
 go take your place in the temple and give the people all the teaching about this life
 and hearing this they went into the temple at dawn and were teaching but the high priest and those who were with him got together the sanhedrin and the representatives of the children of israel and sent to the prison to get them
 but the men who were sent saw that they were not in the prison and came back with the news
 saying the doors of the prison were safely shut and the keepers were at the doors but when they were open there was nobody inside
 now at these words the captain of the temple and the chief priests were greatly troubled about what might be the end of this business
 and someone came and said to them the men whom you put in prison are in the temple teaching the people
 then the captain and some of the police went and took them but not violently for fear that they might be stoned by the people
 and they took them into the sanhedrin and the high priest said to them
 we gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name and now jerusalem is full of your teaching and you are attempting to make us responsible for this mans death
 but peter and the apostles answering said we have to do the orders of god not of man
 the god of our fathers gave jesus back to life whom you had put to death hanging him on a tree
 him god has put on high at his right hand as a ruler and a saviour to give to israel a change of heart and forgiveness of sins
 and we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who keep his laws
 but when these words came to their ears they were cut to the heart and had a mind to put them to death
 but one of the sanhedrin a pharisee named gamaliel a man of learning in the law of whom all the people had a high opinion got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time
 and he said to them men of israel take care what you do about these men
 for before this there was theudas who said he was someone important to whom about four hundred men gave their support he was put to death and his band was broken up and came to nothing
 after this man there was judas of galilee at the time of the numbering and some of the people went after him he was put to death and all his supporters were put to flight
 and now i say to you do nothing to these men but let them be for if this teaching or this work is of men it will come to nothing
 but if it is of god you will not be able to overcome them and you are in danger of fighting against god
 and he seemed to them to be right and they sent for the apostles and after having them whipped and giving them orders to give no teaching in the name of jesus they let them go
 so they went away from the sanhedrin happy to undergo shame for the name
 and every day in the temple and privately they went on teaching and preaching jesus as the christ
 now in those days when the number of the disciples was increasing protests were made by the greek jews against the hebrews because their widows were not taken care of in the distribution of food every day
 and the apostles sent for all the disciples and said it is not right for us to give up preaching the word of god in order to make distribution of food
 take then from among you seven men of good name full of the spirit and of wisdom to whom we may give control of this business
 then we will give all our time to prayer and the teaching of the word
 and this saying was pleasing to all of them and they made selection of stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas of antioch who had become a jew
 these they took to the apostles who after prayer put their hands on them
 and the word of god was increasing in power and the number of the disciples in jerusalem became very great and a great number of priests were in agreement with the faith
 and stephen full of grace and power did great wonders and signs among the people
 but some of those who were of the synagogue named that of the libertines and some of the men of cyrene and of alexandria and those from cilicia and asia had arguments with stephen
 but they were not able to get the better of him for his words were full of wisdom and of the spirit
 then they got men to say he has said evil against moses and against god in our hearing
 and the people with the rulers and the scribes were moved against him and they came and took him before the sanhedrin
 and they got false witnesses who said this man is for ever saying things against this holy place and against the law
 for he has said in our hearing that this jesus of nazareth will put this place to destruction and make changes in the rules which were handed down to us by moses
 and all those who were in the sanhedrin looking at him saw that his face was like the face of an angel
 then the high priest said are these things true
 and he said my brothers and fathers give hearing the god of glory came to our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he was living in haran
 and said to him go out of your land and away from your family and come into the land to which i will be your guide
 then he came out of the land of the chaldaeans and went into haran and from there when his father was dead he was guided by god into this land where you are living now
 and god gave him no heritage in it not even enough to put his foot on but he gave him an undertaking that he would give it to him and to his children after him though he had no child at that time
 and god said that his seed would be living in a strange land and that they would make them servants and be cruel to them for four hundred years
 and i will be the judge said god of that nation which made them servants and after that they will come out and give me worship in this place
 and he made with him the agreement of which circumcision was the sign and so abraham had a son isaac and gave him circumcision on the eighth day and isaac had a son jacob and jacob was the father of the twelve heads of the families of israel
 and the brothers moved with envy against joseph gave him to the egyptians for money but god was with him
 and made him free from all his troubles and gave him wisdom and the approval of pharaoh king of egypt who made him ruler over egypt and all his house
 now there was no food to be had in all egypt and canaan and there was great trouble and our fathers were not able to get food
 but jacob hearing that there was grain in egypt sent out our fathers the first time
 and the second time his brothers had a meeting with joseph and pharaoh had knowledge of josephs family
 then joseph sent for jacob his father and all his family seventy five persons
 and jacob went down to egypt and came to his end there and so did our fathers
 and they were taken over to shechem and put to rest in the place which abraham got for a price in silver from the sons of hamor in shechem
 but when the time was near for putting into effect the undertaking which god had given to abraham the people were increasing in egypt
 till another king came to power who had no knowledge of joseph
 he having evil designs against our nation was cruel to our fathers and they were forced to put out their young children so that they might not go on living
 at which time moses came to birth and he was very beautiful and he was kept for three months in his fathers house
 and when he was put out pharaohs daughter took him and kept him as her son
 and moses was trained in all the wisdom of egypt and was great in his words and works
 but when he was almost forty years old it came into his heart to go and see his brothers the children of israel
 and seeing one of them being attacked he went to his help and gave the egyptian a death blow
 and he was hoping that his brothers would see that god had sent him to be their saviour but they did not see
 and the day after he came to them while they were having a fight and would have made peace between them saying sirs you are brothers why do you do wrong to one another
 but the man who was doing wrong to his neighbour pushing him away said who made you a ruler and a judge over us
 will you put me to death as you did the egyptian yesterday
 and at these words moses went in flight to the land of midian and was living there for a time and had two sons
 at the end of forty years an angel came to him in the waste land of sinai in the flame of a burning thorn tree
 and moses seeing it was full of wonder and when he came up to have a nearer view of it the voice of the lord came to him saying
 i am the god of your fathers the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob and moses shaking with fear kept his eyes from looking at it
 and the lord said take off the shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy
 truly i have seen the sorrows of my people in egypt and their cries have come to my ears and i have come down to make them free and now come i will send you to egypt
 this moses whom they would not have saying who made you a ruler and a judge him god sent to be a ruler and a saviour by the hand of the angel whom he saw in the thorn tree
 this man took them out having done wonders and signs in egypt and in the red sea and in the waste land for forty years
 this is the same moses who said to the children of israel god will give you a prophet from among your brothers like me
 this is the man who was in the church in the waste land with the angel who was talking to him in sinai and with our fathers and to him were given the living words of god so that he might give them to you
 by whom our fathers would not be controlled but they put him on one side turning back in their hearts to egypt
 and saying to aaron make us gods to go before us as for this moses who took us out of the land of egypt we have no idea what has become of him
 and they made the image of a young ox in those days and made an offering to it and had joy in the work of their hands
 but god was turned from them and let them give worship to the stars of heaven as it says in the book of the prophets did you make offerings to me of sheep and oxen for forty years in the waste land o house of israel
 and you took up the tent of moloch and the star of the god rephan images which you made to give worship to them and i will take you away farther than babylon
 our fathers had the tent of witness in the waste land as god gave orders to moses to make it after the design which he had seen
 which our fathers in their turn took with them when with joshua they came into the heritage of the nations whom god was driving out before the face of our fathers till the time of david
 who was pleasing to god and he had a desire to make a holy tent for the god of jacob
 but solomon was the builder of his house
 but still the most high has not his resting place in houses made with hands as the prophet says
 heaven is the seat of my power and earth is a resting place for my feet what sort of house will you make for me says the lord or what is my place of rest
 did not my hand make all these things
 you whose hearts are hard and whose ears are shut to me you are ever working against the holy spirit as your fathers did so do you
 which of the prophets was not cruelly attacked by your fathers and they put to death those who gave them the news of the coming of the upright one whom you have now given up and put to death
 you to whom the law was given as it was ordered by angels and who have not kept it
 hearing these things they were cut to the heart and moved with wrath against him
 but he was full of the holy spirit and looking up to heaven he saw the glory of god and jesus at the right hand of god
 and he said now i see heaven open and the son of man at the right hand of god
 but with loud cries and stopping their ears they made an attack on him all together
 driving him out of the town and stoning him and the witnesses put their clothing at the feet of a young man named saul
 and stephen while he was being stoned made prayer to god saying lord jesus take my spirit
 and going down on his knees he said in a loud voice lord do not make them responsible for this sin and when he had said this he went to his rest
 and saul gave approval to his death now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in jerusalem and all but the apostles went away into all parts of judaea and samaria
 and god fearing men put stephens body in its last resting place making great weeping over him
 but saul was burning with hate against the church going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison
 but those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word
 and philip went down to samaria and was teaching them about christ
 and all the people gave attention to the words which philip said when they saw the signs which he did
 for unclean spirits came out from those who had them crying with a loud voice and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well
 and there was much joy in that town
 but there was a certain man named simon who in the past had been a wonder worker and a cause of surprise to the people of samaria saying that he himself was a great man
 to whom they all gave attention from the smallest to the greatest saying this man is that power of god which is named great
 and they gave attention to him because for a long time his wonder working powers had kept them under his control
 but when they had faith in the good news given by philip about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ a number of men and women had baptism
 and simon himself had faith and having had baptism he went with philip and seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did he was full of surprise
 now when the apostles at jerusalem had news that the people of samaria had taken the word of god into their hearts they sent to them peter and john
 who when they came there made prayer for them that the holy spirit might be given to them
 for up to that time he had not come on any of them only baptism had been given to them in the name of the lord jesus
 then they put their hands on them and the holy spirit came on them
 now when simon saw that the holy spirit was given through the touch of the apostles hands he made them an offering of money saying
 give me this power so that when i put my hands on anyone he may get the holy spirit
 but peter said may your money come to destruction with you because you had the idea that what is freely given by god may be got for a price
 you have no part in this business because your heart is not right before god
 let your heart be changed and make prayer to god that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts
 for i see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin
 and simon answering said make prayer for me to the lord so that these things which you have said may not come on me
 so they having given their witness and made clear the word of the lord went back to jerusalem giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of samaria
 but an angel of the lord said to philip get up and go to the south to the road which goes from jerusalem to gaza through the waste land
 and he went and there was a man of ethiopia a servant of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians and controller of all her property who had come up to jerusalem for worship
 he was going back seated in his carriage and was reading the book of the prophet isaiah
 and the spirit said to philip go near and get on his carriage
 and philip running up to him saw that he was reading isaiah the prophet and said to him is the sense of what you are reading clear to you
 and he said how is that possible when i have no guide and he made philip get up by his side
 now the place in the book where he was reading was this he was taken like a sheep to be put to death and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut so he made no sound
 being of low degree his cause was not given a hearing who has knowledge of his family for his life is cut off from the earth
 and the ethiopian said to philip about whom are these words said by the prophet about himself or some other
 so philip starting from this writing gave him the good news about jesus
 and while they were going on their way they came to some water and the ethiopian said see here is water why may i not have baptism
   
 and he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped and the two of them went down into the water and philip gave him baptism
 and when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord took philip away and the ethiopian saw him no more for he went on his way full of joy
 but philip came to azotus and went through all the towns preaching the good news till he came to caesarea
 but saul still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the lord went to the high priest
 and made a request for letters from him to the synagogues of damascus so that if there were any of the way there men or women he might take them as prisoners to jerusalem
 and while he was journeying he came near damascus and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him
 and he went down on the earth and a voice said to him saul saul why are you attacking me so cruelly
 and he said who are you lord and he said i am jesus whom you are attacking
 but get up and go into the town and it will be made clear to you what you have to do
 and the men who were with him were not able to say anything hearing the voice but seeing no one
 and saul got up from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw nothing and he was guided by the hand into damascus
 and for three days he was not able to see and he took no food or drink
 now there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and the lord said to him in a vision ananias  and he said here i am lord
 and the lord said to him get up and go to the street which is named straight and make search at the house of judas for one named saul of tarsus for he is at prayer
 and he has seen a man named ananias coming in and putting his hands on him so that he may be able to see
 but ananias said lord i have had accounts of this man from a number of people how much evil he has done to your saints at jerusalem
 and here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name
 but the lord said go without fear for he is a special vessel for me to give to the gentiles and kings and to the children of israel the knowledge of my name
 for i will make clear to him what troubles he will have to undergo for me
 and ananias went out and came to the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord jesus whom you saw when you were on your journey has sent me so that you may be able to see and be full of the holy spirit
 and straight away it seemed as if a veil was taken from his eyes and he was able to see and he got up and had baptism
 and when he had taken food his strength came back and for some days he kept with the disciples who were in damascus
 and straight away in the synagogues he was preaching jesus as the son of god
 and all those hearing him were full of wonder and said is not this the man who in jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests
 but saul went on increasing in power and the jews in damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that jesus was the christ
 then after some days the jews made an agreement together to put him to death
 but saul got knowledge of their design and they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town so that they might put him to death
 but his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket
 and when he came to jerusalem he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples but they were all in fear of him not taking him for a disciple
 but barnabas took him to the apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the lord on the road and had given hearing to his words and how at damascus he had been preaching in the name of jesus without fear
 and he was with them going in and out at jerusalem
 preaching in the name of the lord without fear and he had discussions with the greek jews but they were working for his death
 and when the brothers had knowledge of it they took him to caesarea and sent him to tarsus
 and so the church through all judaea and galilee and samaria had peace and was made strong and living in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy spirit was increased greatly
 and it came about that while peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at lydda
 and there was a certain man there named aeneas who for eight years had been in bed without power of moving
 and peter said to him aeneas jesus christ makes you well get up and make your bed and straight away he got up
 and all those living in lydda and sharon saw him and were turned to the lord
 now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha that is dorcas this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times
 and it came about in those days that she got ill and came to her death and when she had been washed they put her in a room which was high up
 and because lydda was near joppa the disciples having knowledge that peter was there sent two men to him requesting him to come to them straight away
 and peter went with them and when he had come they took him into the room and all the widows were there weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which dorcas had made while she was with them
 but peter made them all go outside and went down on his knees in prayer and turning to the body he said tabitha get up and opening her eyes she saw peter and got up
 and he took her hand lifting her up and sending for the saints and widows he gave her to them living
 and news of it went all through joppa and a number of people had faith in the lord
 and he was living in joppa for some time with simon a leather worker
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the purpose of god and timothy our brother
 to the saints and true brothers in christ at colossae grace to you and peace from god our father
 we give praise to god the father of our lord jesus christ making prayer for you at all times
 after hearing of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints
 through the hope which is in store for you in heaven knowledge of which was given to you before in the true word of the good news
 which has come to you and which in all the world is giving fruit and increase as it has done in you from the day when it came to your ears and you had true knowledge of the grace of god
 as it was given to you by epaphras our well loved helper who is a true servant of christ for us
 and who himself made clear to us your love in the spirit
 for this reason we from the day when we had word of it keep on in prayer for you that you may be full of the knowledge of his purpose with all wisdom and experience of the spirit
 living uprightly in the approval of the lord giving fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god
 full of strength in the measure of the great power of his glory so that you may undergo all troubles with joy
 giving praise to the father who has given us a part in the heritage of the saints in light
 who has made us free from the power of evil and given us a place in the kingdom of the son of his love
 in whom we have our salvation the forgiveness of sins
 who is the image of the unseen god coming into existence before all living things
 for by him all things were made in heaven and on earth things seen and things unseen authorities lords rulers and powers all things were made by him and for him
 he is before all things and in him all things have being
 and he is the head of the body the church the starting point of all things the first to come again from the dead so that in all things he might have the chief place
 for god in full measure was pleased to be in him
 through him uniting all things with himself having made peace through the blood of his cross through him i say uniting all things which are on earth or in heaven
 and you who in the past were cut off and at war with god in your minds through evil works he has now made one
 in the body of his flesh through death so that you might be holy and without sin and free from all evil before him
 if you keep yourselves safely based in the faith not moved from the hope of the good news which came to you and which was given to every living being under heaven of which i paul was made a servant
 now i have joy in my pain because of you and in my flesh i undergo whatever is still needed to make the sorrows of christ complete for the salvation of his body the church
 of which i became a servant by the purpose of god which was given to me for you to give effect to the word of god
 the secret which has been kept from all times and generations but has now been made clear to his saints
 to whom god was pleased to give knowledge of the wealth of the glory of this secret among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory
 whom we are preaching guiding and teaching every man in all wisdom so that every man may be complete in christ
 and for this purpose i am working using all my strength by the help of his power which is working in me strongly
 for it is my desire to give you news of the great fight i am making for you and for those at laodicea and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh
 so that their hearts may be comforted and that being joined together in love they may come to the full wealth of the certain knowledge of the secret of god even christ
 in whom are all the secret stores of wisdom and knowledge
 i say this so that you may not be turned away by any deceit of words
 for though i am not present in the flesh still i am with you in the spirit seeing with joy your order and your unchanging faith in christ
 as then you took christ jesus the lord so go on in him
 rooted and based together in him strong in the faith which the teaching gave you giving praise to god at all times
 take care that no one takes you away by force through mans wisdom and deceit going after the beliefs of men and the theories of the world and not after christ
 for in him all the wealth of gods being has a living form
 and you are complete in him who is the head of all rule and authority
 in whom you had a circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of christ
 having been put to death with him in baptism by which you came to life again with him through faith in the working of god who made him come back from the dead
 and you being dead through your sins and the evil condition of your flesh to you i say he gave life together with him and forgiveness of all our sins
 having put an end to the handwriting of the law which was against us taking it out of the way by nailing it to his cross
 having made himself free from the rule of authorities and powers he put them openly to shame glorying over them in it
 for this reason let no man be your judge in any question of food or drink or feast days or new moons or sabbaths
 for these are an image of the things which are to come but the body is christs
 let no man take your reward from you by consciously making little of himself and giving worship to angels having his thoughts fixed on the things which he has seen being foolishly lifted up in his natural mind
 and not joined to the head from whom all the body being given strength and kept together through its joins and bands has its growth with the increase of god
 if you were made free by your death with christ from the rules of the world why do you put yourselves under the authority of orders
 which say there may be no touching tasting or taking in your hands
  rules which are all to come to an end with their use  after the orders and teaching of men
 these things seem to have a sort of wisdom in self ordered worship and making little of oneself and being cruel to the body not honouring it by giving it its natural use
 if then you have a new life with christ give your attention to the things of heaven where christ is seated at the right hand of god
 keep your mind on the higher things not on the things of earth
 for your life on earth is done and you have a secret life with christ in god
 at the coming of christ who is our life you will be seen with him in glory
 then put to death your bodies which are of the earth wrong use of the flesh unclean things passion evil desires and envy which is the worship of strange gods
 because of which the wrath of god comes on those who go against his orders
 among whom you were living in the past when you did such things
 but now it is right for you to put away all these things wrath passion bad feeling curses unclean talk
 do not make false statements to one another because you have put away the old man with all his doings
 and have put on the new man which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker
 where there is no greek or jew no one with circumcision or without circumcision no division between nations no servant or free man but christ is all and in all
 as saints of god then holy and dearly loved let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy kind feeling a low opinion of yourselves gentle ways and a power of undergoing all things
 being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another if anyone has done wrong to his brother even as the lord had forgiveness for you
 and more than all have love the only way in which you may be completely joined together
 and let the peace of christ be ruling in your hearts as it was the purpose of god for you to be one body and give praise to god at all times
 let the word of christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words making melody to god with grace in your hearts
 and whatever you do in word or in act do all in the name of the lord jesus giving praise to god the father through him
 wives be under the authority of your husbands as is right in the lord
 husbands have love for your wives and be not bitter against them
 children do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things for this is pleasing to the lord
 fathers do not be hard on your children so that their spirit may not be broken
 servants in all things do the orders of your natural masters not only when their eyes are on you as pleasers of men but with all your heart fearing the lord
 whatever you do do it readily as to the lord and not to men
 being certain that the lord will give you the reward of the heritage for you are the servants of the lord christ
 for the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done without respect for any mans position
 masters give your servants what is right and equal conscious that you have a master in heaven
 give yourselves to prayer at all times keeping watch with praise
 and making prayer for us that god may give us an open door for the preaching of the word the secret of christ for which i am now in chains
 so that i may make it clear as it is right for me to do
 be wise in your behaviour to those who are outside making good use of the time
 let your talk be with grace mixed with salt so that you may be able to give an answer to everyone
 tychicus will give you news of all my business he is a dear brother and true servant and helper in the word
 and i have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may have news of how we are and so that he may give your hearts comfort
 and with him i have sent onesimus the true and well loved brother who is one of you they will give you word of everything which is taking place here
 aristarchus my brother prisoner sends his love to you and mark a relation of barnabas  about whom you have been given orders if he comes to you be kind to him 
 and jesus whose other name is justus these are of the circumcision they are my only brother workers for the kingdom of god who have been a comfort to me
 epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ jesus sends you his love ever taking thought for you in his prayers that you may be complete and fully certain of all the purpose of god
 for i give witness of him that he has undergone much trouble for you and for those in laodicea and in hierapolis
 luke our well loved medical friend and demas send you their love
 give my love to the brothers in laodicea and to nymphas and the church in their house
 and when this letter has been made public among you let the same be done in the church of laodicea and see that you have the letter from laodicea
 say to archippus see that you do the work which the lord has given you to do
 i paul give you this word of love in my handwriting keep in memory that i am a prisoner grace be with you
 paul an apostle of christ jesus by the purpose of god to the saints who are at ephesus and those who have faith in christ jesus
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has given us every blessing of the spirit in the heavens in christ
 even as he made selection of us in him from the first so that we might be holy and free from all evil before him in love
 as we were designed before by him for the position of sons to himself through jesus christ in the good pleasure of his purpose
 to the praise of the glory of his grace which he freely gave to us in the loved one
 in whom we have salvation through his blood the forgiveness of our sins through the wealth of his grace
 which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care
 having made clear to us the secret of his purpose in agreement with the design which he had in mind to put into his hands
 the ordering of the times when they are complete so that all things might come to a head in christ the things in heaven and the things on the earth in him i say
 in whom we have a heritage being marked out from the first in his purpose who does all things in agreement with his designs
 so that his glory might have praise through us who first had hope in christ
 in whom you having been given the true word the good news of your salvation and through your faith in him were given the sign of the holy spirit of hope
 which is the first fruit of our heritage till god gets back that which is his to the praise of his glory
 for this cause i having had news of the faith in the lord jesus which is among you and which you make clear to all the saints
 give praise without end for you keeping you in mind in my prayers
 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
 and that having the eyes of your heart full of light you may have knowledge of what is the hope of his purpose what is the wealth of the glory of his heritage in the saints
 and how unlimited is his power to us who have faith as is seen in the working of the strength of his power
 by which he made christ come back from the dead and gave him a place at his right hand in heaven
 far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named not only in the present order but in that which is to come
 and he has put all things under his feet and has made him to be head over all things to the church
 which is his body the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete
 and to you did he give life when you were dead through your wrongdoing and sins
 in which you were living in the past after the ways of this present world doing the pleasure of the lord of the power of the air the spirit who is now working in those who go against the purpose of god
 among whom we all at one time were living in the pleasures of our flesh giving way to the desires of the flesh and of the mind and the punishment of god was waiting for us even as for the rest
 but god being full of mercy through the great love which he had for us
 even when we were dead through our sins gave us life together with christ  by grace you have salvation 
 so that we came back from death with him and are seated with him in the heavens in christ jesus
 that in the time to come he might make clear the full wealth of his grace in his mercy to us in christ jesus
 because by grace you have salvation through faith and that not of yourselves it is given by god
 not by works so that no man may take glory to himself
 for by his act we were given existence in christ jesus to do those good works which god before made ready for us so that we might do them
 for this reason keep it in mind that in the past you the gentiles in the flesh who are looked on as being outside the circumcision by those who have circumcision in the flesh made by hands
 that you were at that time without christ being cut off from any part in israels rights as a nation having no part in gods agreement having no hope and without god in the world
 but now in christ jesus you who at one time were far off are made near in the blood of christ
 for he is our peace who has made the two into one and by whom the middle wall of division has been broken down
 having in his flesh put an end to that which made the division between us even the law with its rules and orders so that he might make in himself of the two one new man so making peace
 and that the two might come into agreement with god in one body through the cross so putting an end to that division
 and he came preaching peace to you who were far off and to those who were near
 because through him the two of us are able to come near in one spirit to the father
 so then you are no longer as those who have no part or place in the kingdom of god but you are numbered among the saints and of the family of god
 resting on the base of the apostles and prophets christ jesus himself being the chief keystone
 in whom all the building rightly joined together comes to be a holy house of god in the lord
 in whom you with the rest are united together as a living place of god in the spirit
 for this cause i paul the prisoner of christ jesus for you gentiles
 if that ordering of the grace of god has come to your knowledge which was given to me for you
 how by revelation the secret was made clear to me as i said before in a short letter
 by the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of christ
 which in other generations was not given to the sons of men but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy apostles and prophets in the spirit
 which is that the gentiles have a part in the heritage and in the same body and in the same hope in christ through the good news
 of which i was made a preacher through that grace of god which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power
 to me who am less than the least of all the saints was this grace given so that i might make clear to the gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of christ
 and make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in god who made all things
 so that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wide shining wisdom of god
 which is seen in his eternal purpose in christ jesus our lord
 by whom we come near to god without fear through faith in him
 for this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you which are your glory
 for this cause i go down on my knees before the father
 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named
 that in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his spirit in your hearts
 so that christ may have his place in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and based in love
 may have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is
 and to have knowledge of the love of christ which is outside all knowledge so that you may be made complete as god himself is complete
 now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts through the power which is working in us
 to him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations for ever and ever so be it
 i then the prisoner in the lord make this request from my heart that you will see that your behaviour is a credit to the position which gods purpose has given you
 with all gentle and quiet behaviour taking whatever comes putting up with one another in love
 taking care to keep the harmony of the spirit in the yoke of peace
 there is one body and one spirit even as you have been marked out by god in the one hope of his purpose for you
 one lord one faith one baptism
 one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all
 but to every one of us has grace been given in the measure of the giving of christ
 for this reason he says he went up on high taking his prisoners with him and gave freely to men
  now this he went up what is it but that he first went down into the lower parts of the earth
 he who went down is the same who went up far over all the heavens so that he might make all things complete 
 and he gave some as apostles and some prophets and some preachers of the good news and some to give care and teaching
 for the training of the saints as servants in the church for the building up of the body of christ
 till we all come to the harmony of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to full growth to the full measure of christ
 so that we may be no longer children sent this way and that turned about by every wind of teaching by the twisting and tricks of men by the deceits of error
 but saying true words in love may come to full growth in him who is the head even christ
 through whom all the body being rightly formed and united together by the full working of every part is increased to the building up of itself in love
 this i say then and give witness in the lord that you are to go no longer in the way of the gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit
 whose thoughts are dark to whom the life of god is strange because they are without knowledge and their hearts have been made hard
 who having no more power of feeling have given themselves up to evil passions to do all unclean things with overmuch desire
 for this was not the teaching of christ which was given to you
 if in fact you gave ear to him and were given teaching in him even as what is true is made clear in jesus
 that you are to put away in relation to your earlier way of life the old man which has become evil by love of deceit
 and be made new in the spirit of your mind
 and put on the new man to which god has given life in righteousness and a true and holy way of living
 and so putting away false words let everyone say what is true to his neighbour for we are parts one of another
 be angry without doing wrong let not the sun go down on your wrath
 and do not give way to the evil one
 let him who was a thief be so no longer but let him do good work with his hands so that he may have something to give to him who is in need
 let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is good for giving necessary teaching and for grace to those who give ear
 and do not give grief to the holy spirit of god by whom you were marked for the day of salvation
 let all bitter sharp and angry feeling and noise and evil words be put away from you with all unkind acts
 and be kind to one another full of pity having forgiveness for one another even as god in christ had forgiveness for you
 let it then be your desire to be like god as well loved children
 and be living in love even as christ had love for you and gave himself up for us an offering to god for a perfume of a sweet smell
 but evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things or desire for others property let it not even be named among you as is right for saints
 and let there be no low behaviour or foolish talk or words said in sport which are not right but in place of them the giving of praise
 being certain of this that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh no unclean person or one who has desire for the property of others or who gives worship to images has any heritage in the kingdom of christ and god
 do not be turned from the right way by foolish words for because of these things the punishment of god comes on those who do not put themselves under him
 have no part with such men
 for you at one time were dark but now are light in the lord let your behaviour be that of children of light
  because the fruit of the light is in all righteousness and in everything which is good and true 
 testing by experience what is well pleasing to the lord
 and have no company with the works of the dark which give no fruit but make their true quality clear
 for the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words
 but all things when their true quality is seen are made clear by the light because everything which is made clear is light
 for this reason he says be awake you who are sleeping and come up from among the dead and christ will be your light
 take care then how you are living not as unwise but as wise
 making good use of the time because the days are evil
 for this reason then do not be foolish but be conscious of the lords pleasure
 and do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome but be full of the spirit
 joining with one another in holy songs of praise and of the spirit using your voice in songs and making melody in your heart to the lord
 giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our lord jesus christ to god even the father
 letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of christ
 wives be under the authority of your husbands as of the lord
 for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church being himself the saviour of the body
 and as the church is under christs authority so let wives be under the rule of their husbands in all things
 husbands have love for your wives even as christ had love for the church and gave himself for it
 so that he might make it holy having made it clean with the washing of water by the word
 and might take it for himself a church full of glory not having one mark or fold or any such thing but that it might be holy and complete
 even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies he who has love for his wife has love for himself
 for no man ever had hate for his flesh but he gives it food and takes care of it even as christ does for the church
 because we are parts of his body
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
 this is a great secret but my words are about christ and the church
 but do you everyone have love for his wife even as for himself and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband
 children do what is ordered by your fathers and mothers in the lord for this is right
 give honour to your father and mother  which is the first rule having a reward 
 so that all may be well for you and your life may be long on the earth
 and you fathers do not make your children angry but give them training in the teaching and fear of the lord
 servants do what is ordered by those who are your natural masters having respect and fear for them with all your heart as to christ
 not only under your masters eye as pleasers of men but as servants of christ doing the pleasure of god from the heart
 doing your work readily as to the lord and not to men
 in the knowledge that for every good thing anyone does he will have his reward from the lord if he is a servant or if he is free
 and you masters do the same things to them not making use of violent words in the knowledge that their master and yours is in heaven and he has no respect for a mans position
 lastly be strong in the lord and in the strength of his power
 take up gods instruments of war so that you may be able to keep your position against all the deceits of the evil one
 for our fight is not against flesh and blood but against authorities and powers against the world rulers of this dark night against the spirits of evil in the heavens
 for this reason take up all the arms of god so that you may be able to be strong in the evil day and having done all to keep your place
 take your place then having your body clothed with the true word and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
 be ready with the good news of peace as shoes on your feet
 and most of all using faith as a cover to keep off all the flaming arrows of the evil one
 and take salvation for your head dress and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
 with prayers and deep desires making requests at all times in the spirit and keeping watch with strong purpose in prayer for all the saints
 and for me that words may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make clear without fear the secret of the good news
 for which i am a representative in chains and that i may say without fear the things which it is right for me to say
 but so that you may have knowledge of my business and how i am tychicus the well loved brother and tested servant in the lord will give you news of all things
 whom i have sent to you for this very purpose so that you may have knowledge of our position and that he may give comfort to your hearts
 peace be to the brothers and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ
 grace be with all those who have true love for our lord jesus christ
 paul an apostle  not from men and not through man but through jesus christ and god the father who made him come back from the dead 
 and all the brothers who are with me to the churches of galatia
 grace to you and peace from god the father and our lord jesus christ
 who gave himself for our sins so that he might make us free from this present evil world after the purpose of our god and father
 to whom be the glory for ever and ever so be it
 i am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of christ to good news of a different sort
 which is not another sort only there are some who give you trouble desiring to make changes in the good news of christ
 but even if we or an angel from heaven were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you let there be a curse on him
 as we have said before so say i now again if any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you let there be a curse on him
 am i now using arguments to men or god or is it my desire to give men pleasure if i was still pleasing men i would not be a servant of christ
 because i say to you my brothers that the good news of which i was the preacher is not mans
 for i did not get it from man and i was not given teaching in it but it came to me through revelation of jesus christ
 for news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the jews religion how i was cruel without measure to the church of god and did great damage to it
 and i went farther in the jews religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers
 but when it was the good pleasure of god by whom i was marked out even from my mothers body through his grace
 to give the revelation of his son in me so that i might give the news of him to the gentiles then i did not take the opinion of flesh and blood
 and i went not up to jerusalem to those who were apostles before me but i went away into arabia and again i came back to damascus
 then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see cephas and was there with him fifteen days
 but of the other apostles i saw only james the lords brother
 now god is witness that the things which i am writing to you are true
 then i came to the parts of syria and cilicia
 and the churches of judaea which were in christ still had no knowledge of my face or person
 only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him
 and they gave glory to god in me
 then after the space of fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas taking titus with me
 and i went up by revelation and i put before them the good news which i was preaching among the gentiles but privately before those who were of good name so that the work which i was or had been doing might not be without effect
 but not even titus who was with me being a greek was made to undergo circumcision
 and that because of the false brothers let in secretly who came searching out our free condition which we have in christ jesus so that they might make servants of us
 to whom we gave way not even for an hour so that the true words of the good news might still be with you
 but from those who seemed to be important  whatever they were has no weight with me god does not take mans person into account  those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me
 but quite the opposite when they saw that i had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision even as peter had been for those of the circumcision
  because he who was working in peter as the apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the gentiles 
 when they saw the grace which was given to me james and cephas and john who had the name of being pillars gave to me and barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the gentiles and they to the circumcision
 only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor which very thing i had much in mind to do
 but when cephas came to antioch i made a protest against him to his face because he was clearly in the wrong
 for before certain men came from james he did take food with the gentiles but when they came he went back and made himself separate fearing those who were of the circumcision
 and the rest of the jews went after him so that even barnabas was overcome by their false ways
 but when i saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news i said to cephas before them all if you being a jew are living like the gentiles and not like the jews how will you make the gentiles do the same as the jews
 we being jews by birth and not sinners of the gentiles
 being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law but through faith in jesus christ we had faith in christ jesus so that we might get righteousness by faith in christ and not by the works of the law because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness
 but if while we were desiring to get righteousness through christ we ourselves were seen to be sinners is christ a servant of sin in no way 
 for if i put up again those things which i gave to destruction i am seen to be a wrongdoer
 for i through the law have become dead to the law so that i might be living to god
 i have been put to death on the cross with christ still i am living no longer i but christ is living in me and that life which i now am living in the flesh i am living by faith the faith of the son of god who in love for me gave himself up for me
 i do not make the grace of god of no effect because if righteousness is through the law then christ was put to death for nothing
 o foolish galatians by what strange powers have you been tricked to whom it was made clear that jesus christ was put to death on the cross
 give me an answer to this one question did the spirit come to you through the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
 are you so foolish having made a start in the spirit will you now be made complete in the flesh
 did you undergo such a number of things to no purpose if it is in fact to no purpose
 he who gives you the spirit and does works of power among you is it by the works of law or by the hearing of faith
 even as abraham had faith in god and it was put to his account as righteousness
 be certain then that those who are of faith the same are sons of abraham
 and the holy writings seeing before the event that god would give the gentiles righteousness by faith gave the good news before to abraham saying in you will all the nations have a blessing
 so then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of abraham who was full of faith
 for all who are of the works of the law are under a curse because it is said in the writings a curse is on everyone who does not keep on doing all the things which are ordered in the book of the law
 now that no man gets righteousness by the law in the eyes of god is clear because the upright will be living by faith
 and the law is not of faith but he who does them will have life by them
 christ has made us free from the curse of the law having become a curse for us because it is said in the writings a curse on everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree
 so that on the gentiles might come the blessing of abraham in christ jesus in order that we through faith might have the spirit which god had undertaken to give
 brothers as men would say even a mans agreement when it has been made certain may not be put on one side or have additions made to it
 now to abraham were the undertakings given and to his seed he says not and to seeds as of a great number but as of one he says and to your seed which is christ
 now this i say the law which came four hundred and thirty years after does not put an end to the agreement made before by god so as to make the undertaking without effect
 because if the heritage is by the law it is no longer dependent on the word of god but god gave it to abraham by his word
 what then is the law it was an addition made because of sin till the coming of the seed to whom the undertaking had been given and it was ordered through angels by the hand of a go between
 now a go between is not a go between of one but god is one
 is the law then against the words of god in no way because if there had been a law which was able to give life truly righteousness would have been by the law
 however the holy writings have put all things under sin so that that for which god gave the undertaking based on faith in jesus christ might be given to those who have such faith
 but before faith came we were kept in prison under the law waiting for the revelation of the faith which was to come
 so the law has been a servant to take us to christ so that we might have righteousness by faith
 but now that faith is come we are no longer under a servant
 because you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus
 for all those of you who were given baptism into christ did put on christ
 there is no jew or greek servant or free male or female because you are all one in jesus christ
 and if you are christs then you are abrahams seed and yours is the heritage by the right of gods undertaking given to abraham
 but i say that as long as the son is a child he is in no way different from a servant though he is lord of all
 but is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father
 so we when we were young were kept under the first rules of the world
 but when the time had come god sent out his son made of a woman made under the law
 that he might make them free who were under the law and that we might be given the place of sons
 and because you are sons god has sent out the spirit of his son into our hearts saying abba father
 so that you are no longer a servant but a son and if a son then the heritage of god is yours
 but at that time having no knowledge of god you were servants to those who by right are no gods
 but now that you have come to have knowledge of god or more truly god has knowledge of you how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things desiring to be servants to them again
 you keep days and months and fixed times and years
 i am in fear of you that i may have been working for you to no purpose
 my desire for you brothers is that you may be as i am because i am as you are you have done me no wrong
 but you have knowledge that with a feeble body i was preaching the good news to you the first time
 and you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh or put shame on it but you took me to your hearts as an angel of god even as christ jesus
 where then is that happy condition of yours because i give you witness that if possible you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me
 so then am i no longer your friend because i give you true words
 their interest in you is not good but their desire is that you may be shut out so that you may go after them
 but it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times and not only when i am present with you
 my children of whom i am again in birth pains till christ is formed in you
 truly my desire is to be present with you now using a changed voice for i am troubled about you
 say you whose desire it is to be under the law do you not give ear to the law
 because it is in the writings that abraham had two sons one by the servant woman and one by the free woman
 now the son by the servant woman has his birth after the flesh but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of god
 which things have a secret sense because these women are the two agreements one from the mountain of sinai giving birth to servants which is hagar
 now this hagar is the mountain sinai in arabia and is the image of the jerusalem which now is which is a servant with her children
 but the jerusalem on high is free which is our mother
 for it is in the writings you who have never given birth be glad give cries of joy you who have had no birth pains for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband
 now we brothers as isaac was are the children of the undertaking of god
 but as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the spirit even so it is now
 what then do the writings say send away the servant woman and her son for the son of the servant woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman
 so brothers we are not children of the servant woman but of the free woman
 christ has truly made us free then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again
 see i paul say to you that if you undergo circumcision christ will be of no use to you
 yes i give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision that he will have to keep all the law
 you are cut off from christ you who would have righteousness by the law you are turned away from grace
 for we through the spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness
 because in christ jesus having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit but only faith working through love
 you were going on well who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true
 this ready belief did not come from him who had made you his
 a little leaven makes a change in all the mass
 i am certain about you in the lord that you will be of no other mind but he who is troubling you will have his punishment whoever he is
 but i brothers if i am still preaching circumcision why am i still attacked then has the shame of the cross been taken away
 my desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves
 because you brothers were marked out to be free only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance but through love be servants one to another
 for all the law is made complete in one word even in this have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 but if you are given to fighting with one another take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another
 but i say go on in the spirit and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh
 for the flesh has desires against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh because these are opposite the one to the other so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do
 but if you are guided by the spirit you are not under the law
 now the works of the flesh are clear which are these evil desire unclean things wrong use of the senses
 worship of images use of strange powers hates fighting desire for what another has angry feelings attempts to get the better of others divisions false teachings
 envy uncontrolled drinking and feasting and such things of which i give you word clearly even as i did in the past that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of god
 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace a quiet mind kind acts well doing faith
 gentle behaviour control over desires against such there is no law
 and those who are christs have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires
 if we are living by the spirit by the spirit let us be guided
 let us not be full of self glory making one another angry having envy of one another
 brothers if a man is taken in any wrongdoing you who are of the spirit will put such a one right in a spirit of love keeping watch on yourself for fear that you yourself may be tested
 take on yourselves one anothers troubles and so keep the law of christ
 for if a man has an idea that he is something when he is nothing he is tricked by himself
 but let every man make test of his work and then will his cause for glory be in himself only and not in his neighbour
 because every man is responsible for his part of the work
 but let him who gets teaching in the word give a part in all good things to his teacher
 be not tricked god is not made sport of for whatever seed a man puts in that will he get back as grain
 because he who puts in the seed of the flesh will of the flesh get the reward of death but he who puts in the seed of the spirit will of the spirit get the reward of eternal life
 and let us not get tired of well doing for at the right time we will get in the grain if we do not give way to weariness
 so then as we have the chance let us do good to all men and specially to those who are of the family of the faith
 see the size of the handwriting which i myself have made use of in writing to you
 those who have the desire to seem important in the flesh put force on you to undergo circumcision only that they may not be attacked because of the cross of christ
 because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law but they would have you undergo circumcision so that they may have glory in your flesh
 but far be it from me to have glory in anything but only in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which this world has come to an end on the cross for me and i for it
 for having circumcision is nothing and not having circumcision is nothing but only a new order of existence
 and on all who are guided by this rule be peace and mercy and on the israel of god
 from this time on let no man be a trouble to me because my body is marked with the marks of jesus
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brothers so be it
 in times past the word of god came to our fathers through the prophets in different parts and in different ways
 but now at the end of these days it has come to us through his son to whom he has given all things for a heritage and through whom he made the order of the generations
 who being the outshining of his glory the true image of his substance supporting all things by the word of his power having given himself as an offering making clean from sins took his seat at the right hand of god in heaven
 having become by so much better than the angels as the name which is his heritage is more noble than theirs
 to which of the angels did god say at any time you are my son this day i have given you being or i will be his father and he will be my son
 and again when he is sending his only son into the world he says let all the angels of god give him worship
 and of the angels he says who makes his angels winds and his servants flames of fire
 but of the son he says your seat of power o god is for ever and ever and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness
 you have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil and so god your god has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you
 you lord at the first did put the earth on its base and the heavens are the works of your hands
 they will come to their end but you are for ever they will become old as a robe
 they will be rolled up like a cloth even like a robe and they will be changed but you are the same and your years will have no end
 but of which of the angels has he said at any time take your seat at my right hand till i put all those who are against you under your feet
 are they not all helping spirits who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation
 for the law being only a poor copy of the future good things and not the true image of those things is never able to make the people who come to the altar every year with the same offerings completely clean
 for if this had been possible would there not have been an end of those offerings because the worshippers would have been made completely clean and would have been no longer conscious of sins
 but year by year there is a memory of sins in those offerings
 because it is not possible for the blood of oxen and goats to take away sins
 so that when he comes into the world he says you had no desire for offerings but you made a body ready for me
 you had no joy in burned offerings or in offerings for sin
 then i said see i have come to do your pleasure o god  as it is said of me in the roll of the book 
 after saying you had no desire for offerings for burned offerings or offerings for sin  which are made by the law  and you had no pleasure in them
 then he said see i have come to do your pleasure he took away the old order so that he might put the new order in its place
 by that pleasure we have been made holy by the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for ever
 and every priest takes his place at the altar day by day doing what is necessary and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins
 but when jesus had made one offering for sins for ever he took his place at the right hand of god
 and has been waiting there from that time till all who are against him are made a foot rest for his feet
 because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy
 and the holy spirit is a witness for us for after he had said
 this is the agreement which i will make with them after those days says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts writing them in their minds he said
 and i will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil doings
 now where there is forgiveness of these there is no more offering for sin
 so then my brothers being able to go into the holy place without fear because of the blood of jesus
 by the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil that is to say his flesh
 and having a great priest over the house of god
 let us go in with true hearts in certain faith having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water
 let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking for he is true who has given his word
 and let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works
 not giving up our meetings as is the way of some but keeping one another strong in faith and all the more because you see the day coming near
 for if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true there is no more offering for sins
 but only a great fear of being judged and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of god
 a man who has gone against the law of moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses
 but will not the man by whom the son of god has been crushed under foot and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing and who has had no respect for the spirit of grace be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment
 for we have had experience of him who says punishment is mine i will give reward and again the lord will be judge of his people
 we may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living god
 but give thought to the days after you had seen the light when you went through a great war of troubles
 in part in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts before the eyes of everyone and in part in being united with those who were attacked in this way
 for you had pity on those who were in prison and had joy in the loss of your property in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever
 so do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded
 for having done what was right in gods eyes you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you
 in a very little time he who is coming will come he will not be slow
 but the upright man will be living by his faith and if he goes back my soul will have no pleasure in him
 but we are not of those who go back to destruction but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul
 now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the sign that the things not seen are true
 for by it our fathers had gods approval
 by faith it is clear to us that the order of events was fixed by the word of god so that what is seen has not been made from things which only seem to be
 by faith abel made a better offering to god than cain and he had witness through it of his righteousness god giving his approval of his offering and his voice still comes to us through it though he is dead
 by faith enoch was taken up to heaven so that he did not see death he was seen no longer for god took him away for before he was taken witness had been given that he was well pleasing to god
 and without faith it is not possible to be well pleasing to him for it is necessary for anyone who comes to god to have the belief that god is and that he is a rewarder of all those who make a serious search for him
 by faith noah being moved by the fear of god made ready an ark for the salvation of his family because god had given him news of things which were not seen at the time and through it the world was judged by him and he got for his heritage the righteousness which is by faith
 by faith abraham did as god said when he was ordered to go out into a place which was to be given to him as a heritage and went out without knowledge of where he was going
 by faith he was a wanderer in the land of the agreement as in a strange land living in tents with isaac and jacob who had a part with him in the same heritage
 for he was looking for the strong town whose builder and maker is god
 and by faith sarah herself had power to give birth when she was very old because she had faith in him who gave his word
 so that from one man who was near to death came children in number as the stars in heaven or as the sand by the seaside which may not be numbered
 all these came to their end in faith not having had the heritage but having seen it with delight far away they gave witness that they were wanderers and not of the earth
 for those who say such things make it clear that they are searching for a country for themselves
 and truly if they had kept in mind the country from which they went out they would have had chances of turning back
 but now their desire is for a better country that is to say for one in heaven and so it is no shame to god to be named their god for he has made ready a town for them
 by faith abraham made an offering of isaac when he was tested and he with whom the agreement had been made gave up as an offering the only son of his body
 of whom it had been said from isaac will your seed take their name
 judging that god was able to give life even to the dead and because of this he did get him back as if from death
 by faith isaac blessing jacob and esau gave news of things to come
 by faith jacob gave a blessing to the two sons of joseph when he was near to death and gave god worship supported by his stick
 by faith joseph when his end was near said that the children of israel would go out of egypt and gave orders about his bones
 by faith moses was kept secretly by his father and mother for three months after his birth because they saw that he was a fair child and they had no fear of the kings orders
 by faith moses when he became a man had no desire to be named the son of pharaohs daughter
 feeling that it was better to undergo pain with the people of god than for a short time to have a taste of the pleasures of sin
 judging a part in the shame of christ to be better than all the wealth of egypt for he was looking forward to his reward
 by faith he went out of egypt not being turned from his purpose by fear of the wrath of the king for he kept on his way as seeing him who is unseen
 by faith he kept the passover and put the sign of the blood on the houses so that the angel of destruction might not put their oldest sons to death
 by faith they went through the red sea as if it had been dry land though the egyptians were overcome by the water when they made an attempt to do the same
 by faith the walls of jericho came down after they had been circled for seven days
 by faith rahab the loose woman was not put to death with those who had gone against gods orders because she had taken into her house in peace those sent to see the land
 what more am i to say for there would not be time to give the stories of gideon barak samson and jephthah of david and samuel and the prophets
 who through faith overcame kingdoms did righteousness got their reward kept the mouths of lions shut
 put out the power of fire got safely away from the edge of the sword were made strong when they had been feeble became full of power in war and put to flight the armies of the nations
 women had their dead given back to them living others let themselves be cruelly attacked having no desire to go free so that they might have a better life to come
 and others were tested by being laughed at or by blows and even with chains and prisons
 they were stoned they were cut up with knives they were tested they were put to death with the sword they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins being poor and in pain and cruelly attacked
 wandering in waste places and in mountains and in holes in the rocks for whom the world was not good enough
 and not one of these got the good things of the agreement though they all had a good record through faith
 because god had kept some better thing for us so that it was not possible for them to become complete without us
 for this reason as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses putting off every weight and the sin into which we come so readily let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us
 having our eyes fixed on jesus the guide and end of our faith who went through the pains of the cross not caring for the shame because of the joy which was before him and who has now taken his place at the right hand of gods seat of power
 give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose
 till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin
 and you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons my son do not make little of the lords punishment and do not give up hope when you are judged by him
 for the lord sends punishment on his loved ones everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod
 it is for your training that you undergo these things god is acting to you as a father does to his sons for what son does not have punishment from his father
 but if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part then you are not true sons but children of shame
 and again if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect how much more will we be under the authority of the father of spirits and have life
 for they truly gave us punishment for a short time as it seemed good to them but he does it for our profit so that we may become holy as he is
 at the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy but after those who have been trained by it get from it the peace giving fruit of righteousness
 for this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up and let the feeble knees be made strong
 and make straight roads for your feet so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way but may be made strong
 let your desire be for peace with all men and to be made holy without which no man may see the lord
 looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of god for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you and that some of you may be made unclean by it
 and that there may not be any evil liver or any man without respect for god like esau who let his birthright go for a plate of food
 for you have knowledge that even long after when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage he was turned away though he made his request frequently and with weeping because the past might not be changed
 you have not come to a mountain which may be touched and is burning with fire and to a black cloud and a dark smoke and a violent wind
 and to the sound of a horn and the voice of words the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them
 for the order which said if the mountain is touched even by a beast the beast is to be stoned seemed hard to them
 and the vision was so overpowering that even moses said i am shaking and full of fear
 but you have come to the mountain of zion to the place of the living god to the jerusalem which is in heaven and to an army of angels which may not be numbered
 to the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of good men made complete
 and to jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between god and man and to the sign of the blood which says better things than abels blood
 see that you give ear to his voice which comes to you for if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven
 whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth but now he has made an oath saying there will be still one more shaking not only of the earth but of heaven
 and the words still one more make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking as of things which are made so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible
 if then we have a kingdom which will never be moved let us have grace so that we may give god such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect
 for our god is an all burning fire
 go on loving your brothers in the faith
 take care to keep open house because in this way some have had angels as their guests without being conscious of it
 keep in mind those who are in chains as if you were chained with them and those who are in trouble as being yourselves in the body
 let married life be honoured among all of you and not made unclean for men untrue in married life will be judged by god
 be free from the love of money and pleased with the things which you have for he himself has said i will be with you at all times
 so that we say with a good heart the lord is my helper i will have no fear what is man able to do to me
 keep in mind those who were over you and who gave you the word of god seeing the outcome of their way of life let your faith be like theirs
 jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever
 do not be turned away by different strange teachings because it is good for your hearts to be made strong by grace and not by meats which were of no profit to those who took so much trouble over them
 we have an altar from which those priests who are servants in the tent may not take food
 for the bodies of the beasts whose blood is taken into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the circle of the tents
 for this reason jesus was put to death outside the walls so that he might make the people holy by his blood
 let us then go out to him outside the circle of the tents taking his shame on ourselves
 for here we have no fixed resting place but our search is for the one which is to come
 let us then make offerings of praise to god at all times through him that is to say the fruit of lips giving witness to his name
 but go on doing good and giving to others because god is well pleased with such offerings
 give ear to those who are rulers over you and do as they say for they keep watch over your souls ready to give an account of them let them be able to do this with joy and not with grief because that would be of no profit to you
 make prayers for us for we are certain that our hearts are free from the sense of sin desiring the right way of life in all things
 i make this request more strongly in the hope of coming back to you more quickly
 now may the god of peace who made that great keeper of his flock even our lord jesus come back from the dead through the blood of the eternal agreement
 make you full of every good work and ready to do all his desires working in us whatever is pleasing in his eyes through jesus christ and may the glory be given to him for ever and ever so be it
 but brothers take kindly the words which i have said for your profit for i have not sent you a long letter
 our brother timothy has been let out of prison and if he comes here in a short time he and i will come to you together
 give words of love from me to those who are rulers over you and to all the saints those who are in italy send you their love
 may grace be with you all
 for this reason there is the more need for us to give attention to the things which have come to our ears for fear that by chance we might be slipping away
 because if the word which came through the angels was fixed and in the past every evil act against gods orders was given its full punishment
 what will come on us if we do not give our minds to such a great salvation a salvation of which our fathers first had knowledge through the words of the lord and which was made certain to us by those to whom his words came
 and god was a witness with them by signs and wonders and by more than natural powers and by his distribution of the holy spirit at his pleasure
 for he did not make the angels rulers over the world to come of which i am writing
 but a certain writer has given his witness saying what is man that you keep him in mind what is the son of man that you take him into account
 you made him a little lower than the angels you gave him a crown of glory and honour and made him ruler over all the works of your hands
 you put all things under his feet for in making man the ruler over all things god did not put anything outside his authority though we do not see everything under him now
 but we see him who was made a little lower than the angels even jesus crowned with glory and honour because he let himself be put to death so that by the grace of god he might undergo death for all men
 because it was right for him for whom and through whom all things have being in guiding his sons to glory to make the captain of their salvation complete through pain
 for he who makes holy and those who are made holy are all of one family and for this reason it is no shame for him to give them the name of brothers
 saying i will give the knowledge of your name to my brothers i will make a song of praise to you before the church
 and again he says i will put my faith in him and again see i am here and the children which god has given to me
 and because the children are flesh and blood he took a body himself and became like them so that by his death he might put an end to him who had the power of death that is to say the evil one
 and let those who all their lives were in chains because of their fear of death go free
 for truly he does not take on the life of angels but that of the seed of abraham
 because of this it was necessary for him to be made like his brothers in every way so that he might be a high priest full of mercy and keeping faith in everything to do with god making offerings for the sins of the people
 for having been put to the test himself he is able to give help to others when they are tested
 for this reason holy brothers marked out to have a part in heaven give thought to jesus the representative and high priest of our faith
 who kept faith with god who gave him his place even as moses did in all his house
 and it was right for this man to have more honour than moses even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house
 for every house has a builder but the builder of all things is god
 and moses certainly kept faith as a servant in all his house and as a witness of those things which were to be said later
 but christ as a son over his house whose house are we if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end
 and so as the holy spirit says today if you let his voice come to your ears
 be not hard of heart as when you made me angry on the day of testing in the waste land
 when your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years
 so that i was angry with this generation and i said their hearts are in error at all times and they have no knowledge of my ways
 and being angry i made an oath saying they may not come into my rest
 my brothers take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief turning away from the living god
 but give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still today so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin
 for if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start even till the end we have a part with christ
 as it is said today if you will let his voice come to your ears be not hard of heart as when you made him angry
 who made him angry when his voice came to them was it not all those who came out of egypt with moses
 and with whom was he angry for forty years was it not with those who did evil who came to their deaths in the waste land
 and to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest was it not to those who went against his orders
 so we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief
 let us then though we still have gods word that we may come into his rest go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so
 and truly the good news came to us even as it did to them but the hearing of the word did them no good because they were not united in faith with the true hearers
 for those of us who have belief come into his rest even as he has said as i said in my oath when i was angry they may not come into my rest though the works were done from the time of the making of the world
 for in one place he has said of the seventh day and god had rest from all his works on the seventh day
 and in the same place he says again they will not come into my rest
 so that as it is clear that some have to go in and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against gods orders
 after a long time again naming a certain day he says in david today  as he had said before  today if you will let his voice come to your ears be not hard of heart
 for if joshua had given them rest he would not have said anything about another day
 so that there is still a sabbath keeping for the people of god
 for the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works as god did from his
 because of this let us have a strong desire to come into that rest and let no one go after the example of those who went against gods orders
 for the word of god is living and full of power and is sharper than any two edged sword cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit the bones and the muscles and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart
 and there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him there is nothing covered but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do
 having then a great high priest who has made his way through the heavens even jesus the son of god let us be strong in our faith
 for we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested but without sin
 then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear so that mercy may be given to us and we may get grace for our help in time of need
 every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those things which have to do with god so that he may make offerings for sins
 he is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way because he himself is feeble
 and being feeble he has to make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people
 and no man who is not given authority by god as aaron was takes this honour for himself
 in the same way christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest but was given it by him who said you are my son this day i have given you being
 as he says in another place you are a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 who in the days of his flesh having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death had his prayer answered because of his fear of god
 and though he was a son through the pain which he underwent the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under gods orders
 and when he had been made complete he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders
 being named by god a high priest of the order of melchizedek
 of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear because you are slow of hearing
 and though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of gods revelation you have become like babies who have need of milk and not of solid food
 for everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness he is a child
 but solid food is for men of full growth even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil
 for this reason let us go on from the first things about christ to full growth not building again that on which it is based that is the turning of the heart from dead works and faith in god
 the teaching of baptisms and of the putting on of hands and of the future life of the dead and of the judging on the last day
 now we will do this if god lets us
 as for those who at one time saw the light tasting the good things from heaven and having their part in the holy spirit
 with knowledge of the good word of god and of the powers of the coming time
 and then let themselves be turned away it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time because they themselves put the son of god on the cross again openly shaming him
 for a land drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked has a blessing from god
 but if it sends up thorns and evil plants it is of no use and is ready to be cursed its only end is to be burned
 but my loved ones though we say this we are certain that you have better things in you things which go with salvation
 for god is true and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name in the help which you gave and still give to the saints
 and it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end
 so that you may not be slow in heart but may take as your example those to whom god has given their heritage because of their faith and their long waiting
 for when god made his oath to abraham because there was no greater oath he made it by himself
 saying be certain that i will give you my blessing and make your numbers very great
 and so when he had been waiting calmly for a long time gods word to him was put into effect
 for men at all times make their oaths by what is greater and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath
 so that when it was gods desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage that his purpose was fixed he made it more certain with an oath
 so that we who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things in which it is not possible for god to be false
 and this hope is like a strong band for our souls fixed and certain and going in to that which is inside the veil
 where jesus has gone before us as a high priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 for this melchizedek the king of salem a priest of the most high god who gave abraham his blessing meeting him when he came back after putting the kings to death
 and to whom abraham gave a tenth part of everything which he had being first named king of righteousness and then in addition king of salem that is to say king of peace
 being without father or mother or family having no birth or end to his life being made like the son of god is a priest for ever
 now see how great this man was to whom our father abraham gave a tenth part of what he had got in the fight
 and it is true that by the law those of the sons of levi who have the position of priests may take a tenth part of the peoples goods that is to say they take it from their brothers though these are the sons of abraham
 but this man who was not of their family took the tenth from abraham and gave a blessing to him to whom god had given his undertaking
 but there is no doubt that the less gets his blessing from the greater
 now at the present time men over whom death has power take the tenth but then it was taken by one of whom it is witnessed that he is living
 and we may say that in abraham even levi who has a right to take the tenth part gave it
 because he was still in his fathers body when melchizedek came to him
 now if it was possible for things to be made complete through the priests of the house of levi  for the law was given to the people in connection with them  what need was there for another priest who was of the order of melchizedek and not of the order of aaron
 because if the priests are changed it is necessary to make a change in the law
 for he of whom these things are said comes of another tribe of which no man has ever made offerings at the altar
 because it is clear that our lord comes out of judah and moses said nothing about priests from that tribe
 and this is even more clear if a second priest has come up who is like melchizedek
 that is to say not made by a law based on the flesh but by the power of a life without end
 for it has been witnessed of him you are a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 so the law which went before is put on one side because it was feeble and without profit
  because the law made nothing complete  and in its place there is a better hope through which we come near to god
 and as this is not without the taking of an oath
  for those were made priests without an oath but this one was made a priest with an oath by him who says of him the lord gave his oath which he will not take back that you are a priest for ever 
 by so much is it a better agreement which we have through jesus
 and it is true that there have been a great number of those priests because death does not let them go on for ever
 but this priest because his life goes on for ever is unchanging
 so that he is fully able to be the saviour of all who come to god through him because he is ever living to make prayer to god for them
 it was right for us to have such a high priest one who is holy and without evil doing no wrong having no part with sinners and made higher than the heavens
 who has no need to make offerings for sins every day like those high priests first for himself and then for the people because he did this once and for ever when he made an offering of himself
 the law makes high priests of men who are feeble but the word of the oath which was made after the law gives that position to a son in whom all good is for ever complete
 now of the things we are saying this is the chief point we have such a high priest who has taken his place at the right hand of gods high seat of glory in heaven
 as a servant of the holy things and of the true tent which was put up by god not by man
 now every high priest is given authority to take to god the things which are given and to make offerings so that it is necessary for this man like them to have something for an offering
 if he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law
 being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven as moses when he was about to make the tent had special orders from god for see he said that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain
 but now his position as priest is higher because through him god has made a better agreement with man based on the giving of better things
 for if that first agreement had been as good as possible there would have been no place for a second
 for protesting against them he says see the days are coming when i will make a new agreement with the house of israel and with the house of judah
 not like the agreement which i made with their fathers when i took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of egypt for they did not keep the agreement with me and i gave them up says the lord
 for this is the agreement which i will make with the people of israel after those days i will put my laws into their minds writing them in their hearts and i will be their god and they will be my people
 and there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother or his neighbour saying this is the knowledge of the lord for they will all have knowledge of me great and small
 and i will have mercy on their evil doing and i will not keep their sins in mind
 when he says a new agreement he has made the first agreement old but anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer
 now the first agreement had its rules of worship and a holy order
 for the first tent was made ready having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread and this is named the holy place
 and inside the second veil was the place which is named the holy of holies
 having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes and the ark of the agreement which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna and aarons rod which put out buds and the stones with the writing of the agreement
 and over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy seat about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail
 now while these things were in existence the priests went into the first tent at all times for prayer and the making of offerings
 but only the high priest went into the second once a year not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people
 the holy spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open while the first tent was still in being
 and this is an image of the present time when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean
 because they are only rules of the flesh of meats and drinks and washings which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right
 but now christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future through this greater and better tent not made with hands that is to say not of this world
 and has gone once and for ever into the holy place having got eternal salvation not through the blood of goats and young oxen but through his blood
 for if the blood of goats and oxen and the dust from the burning of a young cow being put on the unclean make the flesh clean
 how much more will the blood of christ who being without sin made an offering of himself to god through the holy spirit make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living god
 and for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death the word of god might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage
 because where there is a testament there has to be the death of the man who made it
 for a testament has effect after death for what power has it while the man who made it is living
 so that even the first agreement was not made without blood
 for when moses had given all the rules of the law to the people he took the blood of goats and young oxen with water and red wool and hyssop and put it on the book itself and on all the people
 saying this blood is the sign of the agreement which god has made with you
 and the blood was put on the tent and all the holy vessels in the same way
 and by the law almost all things are made clean with blood and without blood there is no forgiveness
 for this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these
 for christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by mens hands as the copy of the true one but he went into heaven itself and now takes his place before the face of god for us
 and he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his
 for then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world but now he has come to us at the end of the old order to put away sin by the offering of himself
 and because by gods law death comes to men once and after that they are judged
 so christ having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men will be seen a second time without sin by those who are waiting for him for their salvation
 james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the jews living in all parts of the earth
 let it be all joy to you my brothers when you undergo tests of every sort
 because you have the knowledge that the testing of your faith gives you the power of going on in hope
 but let this power have its full effect so that you may be made complete needing nothing
 but if any man among you is without wisdom let him make his request to god who gives freely to all without an unkind word and it will be given to him
 let him make his request in faith doubting nothing for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea which are troubled by the driving of the wind
 let it not seem to such a man that he will get anything from the lord
 for there is a division in his mind and he is uncertain in all his ways
 but let the brother of low position be glad that he is lifted up
 but the man of wealth that he is made low because like the flower of the grass he will come to his end
 for when the sun comes up with its burning heat the grass gets dry and the grace of its form is gone with the falling flower so the man of wealth comes to nothing in his ways
 there is a blessing on the man who undergoes testing because if he has gods approval he will be given the crown of life which the lord has said he will give to those who have love for him
 let no man say when he is tested i am tested by god for it is not possible for god to be tested by evil and he himself puts no man to such a test
 but every man is tested when he is turned out of the right way by the attraction of his desire
 then when its time comes desire gives birth to sin and sin when it is of full growth gives birth to death
 do not be turned from the right way dear brothers
 every good and true thing is given to us from heaven coming from the father of lights with whom there is no change or any shade made by turning
 of his purpose he gave us being by his true word so that we might be in a sense the first fruits of all the things which he had made
 you have knowledge of this dear brothers but let every man be quick in hearing slow in words slow to get angry
 for the righteousness of god does not come about by the wrath of man
 for this reason putting away all dirty behaviour and the overweight of evil take into your souls without pride the word which being planted there is able to give you salvation
 but be doers of the word and not only hearers of it blinding yourselves with false ideas
 because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass
 for after looking at himself he goes away and in a short time he has no memory of what he was like
 but he who goes on looking into the true law which makes him free being not a hearer without memory but a doer putting it into effect this man will have a blessing on his acts
 if a man seems to have religion and has no control over his tongue but lets himself be tricked by what is false this mans religion is of no value
 the religion which is holy and free from evil in the eyes of our god and father is this to take care of children who have no fathers and of widows who are in trouble and to keep oneself untouched by the world
 my brothers if you have the faith of our lord jesus christ of glory do not take a mans position into account
 for if a man comes into your synagogue in fair clothing and with a gold ring and a poor man comes in with dirty clothing
 and you do honour to the man in fair clothing and say come here and take this good place and you say to the poor man take up your position there or be seated at my feet
 is there not a division in your minds have you not become judges with evil thoughts
 give ear my dear brothers are not those who are poor in the things of this world marked out by god to have faith as their wealth and for their heritage the kingdom which he has said he will give to those who have love for him
 but you have put the poor man to shame are not the men of wealth rulers over you do they not take you by force before their judges
 do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you
 but if you keep the greatest law of all as it is given in the holy writings have love for your neighbour as for yourself you do well
 but if you take a mans position into account you do evil and are judged as evil doers by the law
 for anyone who keeps all the law but makes a slip in one point is judged to have gone against it all
 for he who said do not be untrue in married life is the same who said put no man to death now if you are not untrue in married life but you put a man to death the law is broken
 let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free
 for the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging
 what use is it my brothers for a man to say that he has faith if he does nothing will such a faith give him salvation
 if a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the days food
 and one of you says to them go in peace be warm and full of food but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need what profit is there in this
 even so faith without works is dead
 but a man may say you have faith and i have works let me see your faith without your works and i will make my faith clear to you by my works
 you have the belief that god is one and you do well the evil spirits have the same belief shaking with fear
 do you not see o foolish man that faith without works is of no use
 was not the righteousness of abraham our father judged by his works when he made an offering of isaac his son on the altar
 you see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them
 and the holy writings were put into effect which said and abraham had faith in god and it was put to his account as righteousness and he was named the friend of god
 you see that a mans righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only
 and in the same way was not the righteousness of rahab the loose woman judged by her works when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way
 for as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead
 do not all be teachers my brothers because we teachers will be judged more hardly than others
 for we all go wrong in a number of things if a man never makes a slip in his talk then he is a complete man and able to keep all his body in control
 now if we put bits of iron into horses mouths so that they may be guided by us we have complete control of their bodies
 and again ships though they are so great and are moved by violent winds are turned by a very small guiding blade at the impulse of the man who is using it
 even so the tongue is a small part of the body but it takes credit for great things how much wood may be lighted by a very little fire 
 and the tongue is a fire it is the power of evil placed in our bodies making all the body unclean putting the wheel of life on fire and getting its fire from hell
 for every sort of beast and bird and every living thing on earth and in the sea has been controlled by man and is under his authority
 but the tongue may not be controlled by man it is an unresting evil it is full of the poison of death
 with it we give praise to our lord and father and with it we put a curse on men who are made in gods image
 out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing my brothers it is not right for these things to be so
 does the fountain send from the same outlet sweet and bitter water
 is a fig tree able to give us olives my brothers or do we get figs from a vine or sweet water from the salt sea
 who has wisdom and good sense among you let him make his works clear by a life of gentle wisdom
 but if you have bitter envy in your heart and the desire to get the better of others have no pride in this talking falsely against what is true
 this wisdom is not from heaven but is of the earth and the flesh and the evil one
 for where envy is and the desire to get the better of others there is no order but every sort of evil doing
 but the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy then gentle readily giving way in argument full of peace and mercy and good works not doubting not seeming other than it is
 and the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace
 what is the cause of wars and fighting among you is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies
 you are burning with desire and have not your desire so you put men to death you are full of envy and you are not able to get your desire so you are fighting and making war you have not your desire because you do not make request for it
 you make your request but you do not get it because your request has been wrongly made desiring the thing only so that you may make use of it for your pleasure
 o you who are false to god do you not see that the friends of this world are not gods friends every man desiring to be a friend of this world makes himself a hater of god
 or does it seem to you that it is for nothing that the holy writings say the spirit which god put into our hearts has a strong desire for us
 but he gives more grace so that the writings say god is against the men of pride but he gives grace to those who make themselves low before him
 for this cause be ruled by god but make war on the evil one and he will be put to flight before you
 come near to god and he will come near to you make your hands clean you evil doers put away deceit from your hearts you false in mind
 be troubled with sorrow and weeping let your laughing be turned to sorrow and your joy to grief
 make yourselves low in the eyes of the lord and you will be lifted up by him
 do not say evil against one another my brothers he who says evil against his brother or makes himself his brothers judge says evil against the law and is judging the law and in judging the law you become not a doer of the law but a judge
 there is only one judge and law giver even he who has the power of salvation and of destruction but who are you to be your neighbours judge
 how foolish it is to say today or tomorrow we will go into this town and be there for a year and do business there and get wealth
 when you are not certain what will take place tomorrow what is your life it is a mist which is seen for a little time and then is gone
 but the right thing to say would be if it is the lords pleasure and if we are still living we will do this and that
 but now you go on glorying in your pride and all such glorying is evil
 the man who has knowledge of how to do good and does not do it to him it is sin
 come now you men of wealth give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you
 your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing
 your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you burning into your flesh you have put by your store in the last days
 see the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field is crying out against you and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the lord of armies
 you have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction
 you have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death he puts up no fight against you
 go on waiting calmly my brothers till the coming of the lord like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come
 be as calm in your waiting let your hearts be strong because the coming of the lord is near
 say no hard things against one another brothers so that you will not be judged see the judge is waiting at the doors
 take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble the prophets who gave to men the words of the lord
 we say that those men who have gone through pain are happy you have the story of job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the lord was full of pity and mercy in the end
 but most of all my brothers do not take oaths not by the heaven or by the earth or by any other thing but let your yes be yes and your no be no so that you may not be judged
 is anyone among you in trouble let him say prayers is anyone glad let him make a song of praise
 is anyone among you ill let him send for the rulers of the church and let them say prayers over him putting oil on him in the name of the lord
 and by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well and he will be lifted up by the lord and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness
 so then make a statement of your sins to one another and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well the prayer of a good man is full of power in its working
 elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months
 and he made another prayer and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit
 my brothers if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error
 be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number
 from the first he was the word and the word was in relation with god and was god
 this word was from the first in relation with god
 all things came into existence through him and without him nothing was
 what came into existence in him was life and the life was the light of men
 and the light goes on shining in the dark it is not overcome by the dark
 there was a man sent from god whose name was john
 he came for witness to give witness about the light so that all men might have faith through him
 he himself was not the light he was sent to give witness about the light
 the true light which gives light to every man was then coming into the world
 he was in the world the world which came into being through him but the world had no knowledge of him
 he came to the things which were his and his people did not take him to their hearts
 to all those who did so take him however he gave the right of becoming children of god  that is to those who had faith in his name
 whose birth was from god and not from blood or from an impulse of the flesh and mans desire
 and so the word became flesh and took a place among us for a time and we saw his glory  such glory as is given to an only son by his father  saw it to be true and full of grace
 john gave witness about him crying this is he of whom i said he who is coming after me is put over me because he was in existence before me
 from his full measure we have all been given grace on grace
 for the law was given through moses grace and the true way of life are ours through jesus christ
 no man has seen god at any time the only son who is on the breast of the father he has made clear what god is
 and this is the witness of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to him with the question who are you
 he said quite openly and straightforwardly i am not the christ
 and they said to him what then are you elijah and he said i am not are you the prophet and his answer was i am not
 so they said to him who are you then we have to give some answer to those who sent us what have you to say about yourself
 he said i am the voice of one crying in the waste land make straight the way of the lord as said isaiah the prophet
 those who had been sent came from the pharisees
 and they put this question to him saying why then are you giving baptism if you are not the christ or elijah or the prophet
 johns answer was i give baptism with water but there is one among you of whom you have no knowledge
 it is he who is coming after me i am not good enough to undo his shoes
 these things took place at bethany on the other side of the jordan where john was giving baptism
 the day after john sees jesus coming to him and says see here is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world 
 this is he of whom i said one is coming after me who is put over me because he was in existence before me
 i myself had no knowledge of him but i came giving baptism with water so that he might be seen openly by israel
 and john gave this witness saying i saw the spirit coming down from heaven like a dove and resting on him
 i had no knowledge who he was but he who sent me to give baptism with water said to me the one on whom you see the spirit coming down and resting it is he who gives baptism with the holy spirit
 this i saw myself and my witness is that he is the son of god
 the day after john was there again with two of his disciples
 and looking at jesus while he was walking he said see there is the lamb of god 
 hearing what he said the two disciples went after jesus
 and jesus turning round saw them coming after him and said to them what are you looking for they said to him rabbi  which is to say master  where are you living
 +
 he said to them come and see they went with him then and saw where he was living and they were with him all that day it was then about the tenth hour of the day
 andrew simon peters brother was one of the two men who hearing what john said went after jesus
 early in the morning he came across his brother and said to him we have made discovery  it is the messiah   which is to say the christ 
 and he took him to jesus looking at him fixedly jesus said you are simon the son of john your name will be cephas  which is to say peter 
 the day after this jesus had a desire to go into galilee he came across philip and said to him come and be my disciple
 now philips town was beth saida where andrew and peter came from
 philip came across nathanael and said to him we have made a discovery  it is he of whom moses in the law and the prophets were writing jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
 nazareth  said nathanael is it possible for any good to come out of nazareth philip said to him come and see
 jesus saw nathanael coming to him and said of him see here is a true son of israel in whom there is nothing false
 nathanael said to him where did you get knowledge of me in answer jesus said before philip was talking with you while you were still under the fig tree i saw you
 nathanael said to him rabbi you are the son of god you are king of israel 
 in answer jesus said to him you have faith because i said to you i saw you under the fig tree you will see greater things than these
 and he said to him truly i say to you all you will see heaven opening and gods angels going up and coming down on the son of man
 truly i say to you he who does not go through the door into the place where the sheep are kept but gets in by some other way is a thief and an outlaw
 he who goes in by the door is the keeper of the sheep
 the porter lets him in and the sheep give ear to his voice he says over the names of the sheep and takes them out
 when he has got them all out he goes before them and the sheep go after him for they have knowledge of his voice
 they will not go after another who is not their keeper but will go from him in flight because his voice is strange to them
 in this jesus was teaching them in the form of a story but what he said was not clear to them
 so jesus said again truly i say to you i am the door of the sheep
 all who came before me are thieves and outlaws but the sheep did not give ear to them
 i am the door if any man goes in through me he will have salvation and will go in and go out and will get food
 the thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death he comes for their destruction i have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure
 i am the good keeper of sheep the good keeper gives his life for the sheep
 he who is a servant and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep sees the wolf coming and goes in flight away from the sheep and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions
 because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep
 i am the good keeper i have knowledge of my sheep and they have knowledge of me
 even as the father has knowledge of me and i of the father and i am giving my life for the sheep
 and i have other sheep which are not of this field i will be their guide in the same way and they will give ear to my voice so there will be one flock and one keeper
 for this reason am i loved by the father because i give up my life so that i may take it again
 no one takes it away from me i give it up of myself i have power to give it up and i have power to take it again these orders i have from my father
 there was a division again among the jews because of these words
 and a number of them said he has an evil spirit and is out of his mind why do you give ear to him
 others said these are not the words of one who has an evil spirit is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see
 then came the feast of the opening of the temple in jerusalem it was winter
 and jesus was walking in the temple in solomons covered way
 then the jews came round him saying how long are you going to keep us in doubt if you are the christ say so clearly
 jesus said in answer i have said it and you have no belief the works which i do in my fathers name these give witness about me
 but you have no belief because you are not of my sheep
 my sheep give ear to my voice and i have knowledge of them and they come after me
 and i give them eternal life they will never come to destruction and no one will ever take them out of my hand
 that which my father has given to me has more value than all and no one is able to take anything out of the fathers hand
 i and my father are one
 then the jews took up stones again to send at him
 jesus said to them in answer i have let you see a number of good works from the father for which of those works are you stoning me
 this was their answer we are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words because being a man you make yourself god
 in answer jesus said is there not a saying in your law i said you are gods
 if he said they were gods to whom the word of god came  and the writings may not be broken 
 do you say of him whom the father made holy and sent into the world your words are evil because i said i am gods son
 if i am not doing the works of my father do not have belief in me
 but if i am doing them then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me so that you may see clearly and be certain that the father is in me and i am in the father
 then again they made an attempt to take him but he got away from them
 and he went again to the other side of the jordan to the place where john first gave baptism and he was there for a time
 and a great number of people came to him saying john did no sign but everything john said of this man was true
 and a number came to have faith in him there
 now a certain man named lazarus was ill he was of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha
  the mary whose brother lazarus was ill was the mary who put perfumed oil on the lord and made his feet dry with her hair 
 so the sisters sent to him saying lord your dear friend is ill
 when this came to his ears jesus said the end of this disease is not death but the glory of god so that the son of god may have glory because of it
 now jesus had love in his heart for martha and her sister and lazarus
 so when the news came to him that lazarus was ill he did not go from the place where he was for two days
 then after that time he said to his disciples let us go into judaea again
 the disciples said to him master the jews were attempting only the other day to have you stoned and are you going back there again
 then jesus said in answer are there not twelve hours in the day a man may go about in the day without falling because he sees the light of this world
 but if a man goes about in the night he may have a fall because the light is not in him
 these things said he and after that he said to them lazarus our friend is at rest but i go so that i may make him come out of his sleep
 then his disciples said to him lord if he is resting he will get well
 jesus however was talking of his death but they had the idea that he was talking about taking rest in sleep
 then jesus said to them clearly lazarus is dead
 and because of you i am glad i was not there so that you may have faith but let us go to him
 then thomas who was named didymus said to the other disciples let us go so that we may be with him in death
 now when jesus came he made the discovery that lazarus had been put into the earth four days before
 now bethany was near to jerusalem about two miles away
 and a number of jews had come to martha and mary to give them comfort about their brother
 when martha had the news that jesus was on the way she went out to him but mary did not go from the house
 then martha said to jesus lord if you had been here my brother would not be dead
 but i am certain that even now whatever request you make to god god will give it to you
 jesus said to her your brother will come to life again
 martha said to him i am certain that he will come to life again when all come back from the dead at the last day
 jesus said to her i am myself that day and that life he who has faith in me will have life even if he is dead
 and no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death is this your faith
 she said to him yes lord my faith is that you are the christ the son of god who was to come into the world
 and having said this she went away and said secretly to her sister mary the master is here and has sent for you
 and mary hearing this got up quickly and went to him
 now jesus had not at this time come into the town but was still in the place where martha had seen him
 then the jews who were with her in the house comforting her when they saw mary get up quickly and go out went after her in the belief that she was going to the place of the dead and would be weeping there
 when mary came to where jesus was and saw him she went down at his feet saying lord if you had been here my brother would not be dead
 and when jesus saw her weeping and saw the jews weeping who came with her his spirit was moved and he was troubled
 and said where have you put him they said come and see lord
 and jesus himself was weeping
 so the jews said see how dear he was to him 
 but some of them said this man who made open the eyes of the blind man was he not able to keep his friend from death
 so jesus deeply troubled in heart came to the place of the dead it was a hole in the rock and a stone was over the opening
 jesus said take away the stone martha the sister of him who was dead said lord by this time the body will be smelling for he has been dead four days
 jesus said to her did i not say to you that if you had faith you would see the glory of god
 so they took away the stone and jesus looking up to heaven said father i give praise to you for hearing me
 i was certain that your ears are at all times open to me but i said it because of these who are here so that they may see that you sent me
 then he said in a loud voice lazarus come out 
 and he who was dead came out with linen bands folded tightly about his hands and feet and a cloth about his face jesus said to them make him free and let him go
 then a number of the jews who had come to mary and had seen the things which jesus did had belief in him
 but some of them went to the pharisees with the news of what jesus had done
 then the high priests and the pharisees had a meeting and said what are we doing this man is doing a number of signs
 if we let him go on in this way everybody will have belief in him and the romans will come and take away our place and our nation
 but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you have no knowledge of anything
 you do not see that it is in your interest for one man to be put to death for the people so that all the nation may not come to destruction
 he did not say this of himself but being the high priest that year he said as a prophet that jesus would be put to death for the nation
 and not for that nation only but for the purpose of uniting in one body the children of god all over the world
 and from that day they took thought together how to put him to death
 so jesus no longer went about publicly among the jews but went from there into the country near to the waste land to a town named ephraim where he was for some time with the disciples
 now the passover of the jews was near and numbers of people went up from the country to jerusalem to make themselves clean before the passover
 they were looking for jesus and saying to one another while they were in the temple what is your opinion will he not come to the feast
 now the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that if anyone had knowledge where he was he was to give them word so that they might take him
 then six days before the passover jesus came to bethany where lazarus was whom jesus had made to come back from the dead
 so they made him a meal there and he was waited on by martha and lazarus was among those who were seated with him at table
 then mary taking a pound of perfumed oil of great value put it on the feet of jesus and made them dry with her hair and the house became full of the smell of the perfume
 but one of his disciples judas iscariot  who was to give him up  said
 why was not this perfume traded for three hundred pence and the money given to the poor
  he said this not because he had any love for the poor but because he was a thief and having the money bag took for himself what was put into it 
 then jesus said let her be let her keep what she has for the day of my death
 the poor you have ever with you but me you have not for ever
 then a great number of the jews had news that he was there and they came not only because of jesus but so that they might see lazarus who had been dead and to whom he had given life
 now there was talk among the chief priests of putting lazarus to death
 for because of him a great number of the jews went away and had belief in jesus
 the day after a great number of people who were there for the feast when they had the news that jesus was coming to jerusalem
 took branches of palm trees and went out to him crying a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord the king of israel 
 and jesus saw a young ass and took his seat on it as the writings say
 have no fear daughter of zion see your king is coming seated on a young ass
  these things were not clear to his disciples at first but when jesus had been lifted up into his glory then it came to their minds that these things in the writings were about him and that they had been done to him 
 now the people who were with him when his voice came to lazarus in the place of the dead and gave him life again had been talking about it
 and that was the reason the people went out to him because it had come to their ears that he had done this sign
 then the pharisees said one to another you see you are unable to do anything the world has gone after him
 now there were some greeks among the people who had come up to give worship at the feast
 they came to philip who was of beth saida in galilee and made a request saying sir we have a desire to see jesus
 philip went and gave word of it to andrew and andrew went with philip to jesus
 and jesus said to them in answer the hour of the glory of the son of man has come
 truly i say to you if a seed of grain does not go into the earth and come to an end it is still a seed and no more but through its death it gives much fruit
 he who is in love with life will have it taken from him and he who has no care for his life in this world will keep it for ever and ever
 if any man is my servant let him come after me and where i am there will my servant be if any man becomes my servant my father will give him honour
 now is my soul troubled and what am i to say father keep me from this hour no for this purpose have i come to this hour
 father give glory to your name then there came a voice out of heaven saying i have given it glory and i will give it glory again
 hearing the sound a number of people who were there said that it was thunder others said an angel was talking to him
 jesus said in answer this voice came not for me but for you
 now is this world to be judged now will the ruler of this world be sent out
 and i if i am lifted up from the earth will make all men come to me
  this he said pointing to the sort of death he would have 
 then the people in answer said to him the law says that the christ will have life without end how say you then that it is necessary for the son of man to be lifted up who is this son of man
 jesus said to them for a little time longer the light will be among you while you have the light go on walking in it so that the dark may not overtake you one walking in the dark has no knowledge of where he is going
 in so far as you have the light put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light with these words jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them
 but though he had done such a number of signs before them they still had no belief in him
 so that the words of the prophet isaiah might come true when he said lord who has any belief in our preaching and the arm of the lord to whom has it been unveiled
 for this reason they were unable to have belief because isaiah said again
 he has made their eyes blind and their hearts hard for fear that they might see with their eyes and get knowledge with their hearts and be changed and i might make them well
  isaiah said these words because he saw his glory his words were about him 
 however a number even of the rulers had belief in him but because of the pharisees they did not say so openly for fear that they might be shut out from the synagogue
 for the praise of men was dearer to them than the approval of god
 then jesus said with a loud voice he who has faith in me has faith not in me but in him who sent me
 and he who sees me sees him who sent me
 i have come as a light into the world so that no one who has faith in me will go on living in the dark
 and if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them i am not his judge i did not come to be judge of the world but to give salvation to the world
 he who puts me on one side and does not take my words to heart is not without a judge the word which i have said will be his judge on the last day
 for i have not said it on my authority but the father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it
 and i have knowledge that his order is eternal life so that the things which i say i say them even as the father says them to me
 now before the feast of the passover it was clear to jesus that the time had come for him to go away from this world to the father having once had love for those in the world who were his his love for them went on to the end
 so while a meal was going on the evil one having now put it into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to be false to him
 jesus being conscious that the father had put everything into his hands and that he came from god and was going to god
 got up from table put off his robe and took a cloth and put it round him
 then he put water into a basin and was washing the feet of the disciples and drying them with the cloth which was round him
 so he came to simon peter peter said lord are my feet to be washed by you
 and jesus answering said to him what i do is not clear to you now but it will be clear to you in time to come
 peter said i will never let my feet be washed by you never jesus said in answer if i do not make you clean you have no part with me
 simon peter said to him lord not my feet only but my hands and my head
 jesus said to him he who is bathed has need only to have his feet washed and then he is clean all over and you my disciples are clean but not all of you
  he had knowledge who was false to him that is why he said you are not all clean 
 then after washing their feet and putting on his robe again he took his seat and said to them do you see what i have done to you
 you give me the name of master and lord and you are right that is what i am
 if then i the lord and the master have made your feet clean it is right for you to make one anothers feet clean
 i have given you an example so that you may do what i have done to you
 truly i say to you a servant is not greater than his lord and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him
 if these things are clear to you happy are you if you do them
 i am not talking of you all i have knowledge of my true disciples but things are as they are so that the writings may come true the foot of him who takes bread with me is lifted up against me
 from this time forward i give you knowledge of things before they come about so that when they come about you may have belief that i am he
 truly i say to you he who takes to his heart anyone whom i send takes me to his heart and he who so takes me takes him who sent me
 when jesus had said this he was troubled in spirit and gave witness saying truly i say to you that one of you will be false to me
 then the eyes of the disciples were turned on one another in doubt as to whom he had in mind
 there was at table one of his disciples the one dear to jesus resting his head on jesus breast
 making a sign to him simon peter said who is it he is talking about
 he then resting his head on jesus breast said to him lord who is it
 this was the answer jesus gave it is the one to whom i will give this bit of bread after i have put it in the vessel then he took the bit of bread put it into the vessel and gave it to judas the son of simon iscariot
 and when judas took the bread satan went into him then jesus said to him do quickly what you have to do
 now it was not clear to anyone at table why he said this to him
 some were of the opinion that because judas kept the money bag jesus said to him get the things we have need of for the feast or that he was to give something to the poor
 so judas having taken the bit of bread straight away went out and it was night
 then when he had gone out jesus said now is glory given to the son of man and god is given glory in him
 if god is given glory in him god will give him glory in himself and will give him glory even now
 my dear children i am only to be with you a little longer then you will be looking for me and as i said to the jews so now i say to you where i am going you may not come
 i give you a new law have love one for another even as i have had love for you so are you to have love one for another
 by this it will be clear to all men that you are my disciples if you have love one for another
 simon peter said to him lord where are you going jesus said in answer where i am going you may not come with me now but you will come later
 peter said to him why may i not come with you even now i will give up my life for you
 jesus said in answer will you give up your life for me truly i say to you before the cry of the cock you will have said three times that you are not my disciple
 let not your heart be troubled have faith in god and have faith in me
 in my fathers house are rooms enough if it was not so would i have said that i am going to make ready a place for you
 and if i go and make ready a place for you i will come back again and will take you to be with me so that you may be where i am
 and you all have knowledge of where i am going and of the way to it
 thomas said lord we have no knowledge of where you are going how may we have knowledge of the way
 jesus said to him i am the true and living way no one comes to the father but by me
 if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my father you have knowledge of him now and have seen him
 philip said to him lord let us see the father and we have need of nothing more
 jesus said to him philip have i been with you all this time and still you have no knowledge of me he who has seen me has seen the father why do you say let us see the father
 have you not faith that i am in the father and the father is in me the words which i say to you i say not from myself but the father who is in me all the time does his works
 have faith that i am in the father and that the father is in me at least have faith in me because of what i do
 truly i say to you he who puts his faith in me will do the very works which i do and he will do greater things than these because i am going to my father
 and whatever request you make in my name that i will do so that the father may have glory in the son
 if you make any request to me in my name i will do it
 if you have love for me you will keep my laws
 and i will make prayer to the father and he will give you another helper to be with you for ever
 even the spirit of true knowledge that spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him but you have knowledge of him because he is ever with you and will be in you
 i will not let you be without a friend i am coming to you
 a little time longer and the world will see me no more but you will see me and you will be living because i am living
 at that time it will be clear to you that i am in my father and you are in me and i in you
 he who has my laws and keeps them he it is who has love for me and he who has love for me will be loved by my father and i will have love for him and will let myself be seen clearly by him
 judas  not iscariot  said to him how is it that you will let yourself be seen clearly by us and not by the world
 jesus said to him in answer if anyone has love for me he will keep my words and he will be dear to my father and we will come to him and make our living place with him
 he who has no love for me does not keep my words and the word which you are hearing is not my word but the fathers who sent me
 i have said all this to you while i am still with you
 but the helper the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will be your teacher in all things and will put you in mind of everything i have said to you
 may peace be with you my peace i give to you i give it not as the world gives let not your heart be troubled let it be without fear
 keep in mind how i said to you i go away and come to you again if you had love for me you would be glad because i am going to the father for the father is greater than i
 and now i have given you word of it before it comes so that when it comes you may have faith
 after this i will not say much to you because the ruler of this world comes and he has no power over me
 but he comes so that the world may see that i have love for the father and that i am doing as i am ordered by the father get up and let us go
 i am the true vine and my father is the gardener
 he takes away every branch in me which has no fruit and every branch which has fruit he makes clean so that it may have more fruit
 you are clean even now through the teaching which i have given you
 be in me at all times as i am in you as the branch is not able to give fruit of itself if it is not still on the vine so you are not able to do so if you are not in me
 i am the vine you are the branches he who is in me at all times as i am in him gives much fruit because without me you are able to do nothing
 if a man does not keep himself in me he becomes dead and is cut off like a dry branch such branches are taken up and put in the fire and burned
 if you are in me at all times and my words are in you then anything for which you make a request will be done for you
 here is my fathers glory in that you give much fruit and so are my true disciples
 even as the father has given me his love so i have given my love to you be ever in my love
 if you keep my laws you will be ever in my love even as i have kept my fathers laws and am ever in his love
 i have said these things to you so that i may have joy in you and so that your joy may be complete
 this is the law i give you have love one for another even as i have love for you
 greater love has no man than this that a man gives up his life for his friends
 you are my friends if you do what i give you orders to do
 no longer do i give you the name of servants because a servant is without knowledge of what his master is doing i give you the name of friends because i have given you knowledge of all the things which my father has said to me
 you did not take me for yourselves but i took you for myself and i gave you the work of going about and producing fruit which will be for ever so that whatever request you make to the father in my name he may give it to you
 so this is my law for you have love one for another
 if you are hated by the world keep in mind that i was hated by the world before you
 if you were of the world you would be loved by the world but because you are not of the world but i have taken you out of the world you are hated by the world
 keep in mind the words i said to you a servant is not greater than his lord if they were cruel to me they will be cruel to you if they kept my words they will keep yours
 they will do all this to you because of my name  because they have no knowledge of him who sent me
 if i had not come and been their teacher they would have had no sin but now they have no reason to give for their sin
 he who has hate for me has hate for my father
 if i had not done among them the works which no other man ever did they would have had no sin but now they have seen and they have had hate in their hearts for me and my father
 this comes about so that the writing in their law may be made true their hate for me was without cause
 when the helper comes whom i will send to you from the father even the spirit of true knowledge who comes from the father  he will give witness about me
 and you in addition will give witness because you have been with me from the first
 i have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt
 they will put you out of the synagogues yes the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing gods pleasure
 they will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the father or of me
 i have said these things to you so that when the time comes what i have said may come to your mind i did not say them to you at the first because then i was still with you
 but now i am going to him who sent me and not one of you says to me where are you going
 but your hearts are full of sorrow because i have said these things
 but what i am saying is true my going is for your good for if i do not go away the helper will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you
 and he when he comes will make the world conscious of sin and of righteousness and of being judged
 of sin because they have not faith in me
 of righteousness because i go to the father and you will see me no more
 of being judged because the ruler of this world has been judged
 i have still much to say to you but you are not strong enough for it now
 however when he the spirit of true knowledge has come he will be your guide into all true knowledge for his words will not come from himself but whatever has come to his hearing that he will say and he will make clear to you the things to come
 he will give me glory because he will take of what is mine and make it clear to you
 everything which the father has is mine that is why i say he will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you
 after a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me
 so some of the disciples said one to another what is this he is saying after a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me and i am going to the father
 so they said again and again what is this he is saying a little time his words are not clear to us
 jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him so he said to them is this what you are questioning one with another why i said after a little time you will see me no longer and then again after a little time you will see me
 truly i say to you you will be weeping and sorrowing but the world will be glad you will be sad but your sorrow will be turned into joy
 when a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow because her hour is come but when she has given birth to the child the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world
 so you have sorrow now but i will see you again and your hearts will be glad and no one will take away your joy
 and on that day you will put no questions to me truly i say to you whatever request you make to the father he will give it to you in my name
 up to now you have made no request in my name do so and it will be answered so that your hearts may be full of joy
 all this i have said to you in veiled language but the time is coming when i will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the father clearly
 in that day you will make requests in my name and i do not say that i will make prayer to the father for you
 for the father himself gives his love to you because you have given your love to me and have had faith that i came from god
 i came out from the father and have come into the world again i go away from the world and go to the father
 his disciples said now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language
 now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you through this we have faith that you came from god
 jesus made answer have you faith now
 see a time is coming yes it is now here when you will go away in all directions every man to his house and i will be by myself but i am not by myself because the father is with me
 i have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace in the world you have trouble but take heart  i have overcome the world
 jesus said these things then lifting his eyes to heaven he said father the time has now come give glory to your son so that the son may give glory to you
 even as you gave him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all those whom you have given to him
 and this is eternal life to have knowledge of you the only true god and of him whom you have sent even jesus christ
 i have given you glory on the earth having done all the work which you gave me to do
 and now father let me have glory with you even that glory which i had with you before the world was
 i have given knowledge of your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world yours they were and you gave them to me and they have kept your words
 now it is clear to them that whatever you have given to me comes from you
 because i have given them the words which you gave to me and they have taken them to heart and have certain knowledge that i came from you and they have faith that you sent me
 my prayer is for them my prayer is not for the world but for those whom you have given to me because they are yours
  all mine are yours and yours are mine  and i have glory in them
 and now i will be no longer in the world but they are in the world and i come to you holy father keep them in your name which you have given to me so that they may be one even as we are one
 while i was with them i kept them safe in your name which you have given to me i took care of them and not one of them has come to destruction but only the son of destruction so that the writings might come true
 and now i come to you and these things i say in the world so that they may have my joy complete in them
 i have given your word to them and they are hated by the world because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
 my prayer is not that you will take them out of the world but that you will keep them from the evil one
 they are not of the world any more than i am of the world
 make them holy by the true word your word is the true word
 even as you have sent me into the world so i have sent them into the world
 and for them i make myself holy so that they may be made truly holy
 my prayer is not for them only but for all who will have faith in me through their word
 may they all be one  even as you father are in me and i am in you so let them be in us so that all men may come to have faith that you sent me
 and the glory which you have given to me i have given to them so that they may be one even as we are one
 i in them and you in me so that they may be made completely one and so that it may become clear to all men that you have sent me and that they are loved by you as i am loved by you
 father it is my desire that these whom you have given to me may be by my side where i am so that they may see my glory which you have given to me because you had love for me before the world came into being
 father of righteousness i have knowledge of you though the world has not and to these it is clear that you sent me
 and i have given to them knowledge of your name and will give it so that the love which you have for me may be in them and i in them
 when jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream kedron to a garden into which he went with his disciples
 and judas who was false to him had knowledge of the place because jesus went there frequently with his disciples
 so judas getting a band of armed men and police from the chief priests and pharisees went there with lights and with arms
 then jesus having knowledge of everything which was coming on him went forward and said to them who are you looking for
 their answer was jesus the nazarene jesus said i am he and judas who was false to him was there at their side
 and when he said to them i am he they went back falling to the earth
 so again he put the question to them who are you looking for and they said jesus the nazarene
 jesus made answer i have said that i am he if you are looking for me let these men go away
  he said this so that his words might come true i have kept safe all those whom you gave to me 
 then simon peter who had a sword took it out and gave the high priests servant a blow cutting off his right ear the servants name was malchus
 then jesus said to peter put back your sword am i not to take the cup which my father has given to me
 then the band and the chief captain and the police took jesus and put cords round him
 they took him first to annas because annas was the father in law of caiaphas who was the high priest that year
 it was caiaphas who had said to the jews that it was in their interest for one man to be put to death for the people
 and simon peter went after jesus with another disciple now that disciple was a friend of the high priest and he went in with jesus into the house of the high priest
 but peter was kept outside at the door then this other disciple who was a friend of the high priest came out and had a word with the girl who kept the door and took peter in
 then the girl who was the door keeper said to peter are you not one of this mans disciples in answer he said i am not
 now the servants and the police had made a fire of coals because it was cold they were warming themselves in front of it and peter was there with them warming himself
 then the high priest put questions to jesus about his disciples and his teaching
 jesus made answer i said things openly to the world at all times i have given my teaching in the synagogues and in the temple to which all the jews come and i have said nothing secretly
 why are you questioning me put questions to my hearers about what i have said to them they have knowledge of what i said
 when he said this one of the police by his side gave him a blow with his open hand saying do you give such an answer to the high priest
 jesus said in answer if i have said anything evil give witness to the evil but if i said what is true why do you give me blows
 then annas sent him chained to caiaphas the high priest
 but simon peter was still there warming himself by the fire they said to him are you not one of his disciples he said no i am not
 one of the servants of the high priest a relation of him whose ear had been cut off by peter said did i not see you with him in the garden
 then again peter said no and straight away a cock gave its cry
 so they took jesus from the house of caiaphas to the praetorium it was early they themselves did not go into the praetorium so that they might not become unclean but might take the passover
 so pilate came out to them and put the question what have you to say against this man
 they said to him in answer if the man was not a wrongdoer we would not have given him up to you
 then pilate said to them take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law but the jews said to him we have no right to put any man to death
  that the word of jesus might come true pointing to the sort of death he would have 
 then pilate went back into the praetorium and sent for jesus and said to him are you the king of the jews
 jesus made answer do you say this of yourself or did others say it about me
 pilate said am i a jew your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands what have you done
 jesus said in answer my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom was of this world my disciples would have made a good fight to keep me out of the hands of the jews but my kingdom is not here
 then pilate said to him are you then a king jesus made answer you say that i am a king for this purpose was i given birth and for this purpose i came into the world that i might give witness to what is true every lover of what is true gives ear to my voice
 pilate said to him true what is true having said this he went out again to the jews and said to them i see no wrong in him
 but every year you make a request to me to let a prisoner go free at the passover is it your desire that i let the king of the jews go free
 then again they gave a loud cry not this man but barabbas now barabbas was an outlaw
 then pilate took jesus and had him whipped with cords
 and the men of the army made a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put a purple robe on him
 and they kept coming and saying long life to the king of the jews  and they gave him blows with their hands
 and pilate went out again and said to them see i let him come out to you to make it clear to you that i see no wrong in him
 then jesus came out with the crown of thorns and the purple robe and pilate said to them here is the man 
 so when the chief priests and the police saw him they gave a loud cry to the cross  to the cross  pilate said to them take him yourselves and put him on the cross i see no crime in him
 and the jews made answer we have a law and by that law it is right for him to be put to death because he said he was the son of god
 when this saying came to pilates ears his fear became greater
 and he went again into the praetorium and said to jesus where do you come from but jesus gave him no answer
 then pilate said to him you say nothing to me is it not clear to you that i have power to let you go free and power to put you to death on the cross
 jesus gave this answer you would have no power at all over me if it was not given to you by god so that he who gave me up to you has the greater sin
 hearing this pilate had a desire to let him go free but the jews said in a loud voice if you let this man go you are not caesars friend everyone who makes himself a king goes against caesar
 so when these words came to pilates ear he took jesus out seating himself in the judges seat in a place named in hebrew gabbatha or the stone floor
  it was the day when they made ready for the passover and it was about the sixth hour  and he said to the jews there is your king 
 then they gave a loud cry away with him  away with him  to the cross  pilate said to them am i to put your king to death on the cross the chief priests said in answer we have no king but caesar
 so then he gave him up to them to be put to death on the cross and they took jesus away
 and he went out with his cross on him to the place which is named dead mans head  in hebrew golgotha 
 where they put him on the cross with two others one on this side and one on that and jesus in the middle
 and pilate put on the cross a statement in writing the writing was jesus the nazarene the king of the jews
 the writing was seen by a number of the jews for the place where jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town and the writing was in hebrew and latin and greek
 then the chief priests of the jews said to pilate do not put the king of the jews but he said i am the king of the jews
 but pilate made answer what i have put in writing will not be changed
 and when jesus was nailed to the cross the men of the army took his clothing and made a division of it into four parts to every man a part and they took his coat now the coat was without a join made out of one bit of cloth
 so they said among themselves let this not be cut up but let us put it to the decision of chance and see who gets it  they did this so that the writings might come true which say they made a distribution of my clothing among them and my coat they put to the decision of chance  this was what the men of the army did
 now by the side of the cross of jesus were his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of cleopas and mary magdalene
 so when jesus saw his mother and the disciple who was dear to him he said to his mother mother there is your son 
 then he said to the disciple there is your mother  and from that hour the disciple took her to his house
 after this being conscious that all things had now been done so that the writings might come true jesus said give me water
 now there was a vessel ready full of bitter wine and they put a sponge full of it on a stick and put it to his mouth
 so when jesus had taken the wine he said all is done and with his head bent he gave up his spirit
 now it was the day of getting ready for the passover and so that the bodies might not be on the cross on the sabbath  because the day of that sabbath was a great day  the jews made a request to pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away
 so the men of the army came and the legs of the first were broken and then of the other who was put to death on the cross with jesus
 but when they came to jesus they saw that he was dead by this time and so his legs were not broken
 but one of the men made a wound in his side with a spear and straight away there came out blood and water
 and he who saw it has given witness  and his witness is true he is certain that what he says is true  so that you may have belief
 these things came about so that the writings might be true no bone of his body will be broken
 and again another verse says they will see him who was wounded by their spears
 after these things joseph of arimathaea who was a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews made a request to pilate to let him take away the body of jesus and pilate said he might do so so he went and took away his body
 and nicodemus came  he who had first come to jesus by night  with a roll of myrrh and aloes mixed about a hundred pounds
 then they took the body of jesus folding linen about it with the spices as is the way of the jews when they put the dead to rest
 now there was a garden near the cross and in the garden a new place for the dead in which no man had ever been put
 so they put jesus there because it was the jews day of getting ready for the passover and the place was near
 on the third day two people were going to be married at cana in galilee the mother of jesus was there
 and jesus with his disciples came as guests
 when they had not enough wine the mother of jesus said to him they have no wine
 jesus said to her woman this is not your business my time is still to come
 his mother said to the servants whatever he says to you do it
 now six pots of stone every one taking two or three firkins of water were placed there for the purpose of washing as is the way of the jews
 jesus said to the servants make the pots full of water and they made them full to the top
 then he said to them now take some and give it to the master of the feast so they took it to him
 after tasting the water which had now become wine the master of the feast  having no idea where it came from though it was clear to the servants who took the water out  sent for the newly married man
 and said to him every man first puts out his best wine and when all have had enough he puts out what is not so good but you have kept the good wine till now
 this the first of his signs jesus did at cana in galilee and let his glory be seen openly and his disciples put their faith in him
 after this he went down to capernaum with his mother his brothers and his disciples and they were there not more than two or three days
 the time of the passover of the jews was near and jesus went up to jerusalem
 and there in the temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves and he saw the changers of money in their seats
 and he made a whip of small cords and put them all out of the temple with the sheep and the oxen sending in all directions the small money of the changers and overturning their tables
 and to those who were trading in doves he said take these things away do not make my fathers house a market
 and it came to the minds of the disciples that the writings say i am on fire with passion for your house
 then the jews put this question to him what sign of authority have you to give us seeing that you do these things
 and jesus said to them send destruction on this temple and i will put it up again in three days
 the jews said the building of this temple took forty six years and you will put it up in three days 
 but his words were about that holy building which was his body
 so when he had come back again from the dead the memory of these words came back to the disciples and they had faith in the holy writings and in the word which jesus had said
 now while he was in jerusalem at the feast of the passover a great number of people came to have faith in his name after seeing the signs which he did
 but jesus did not have faith in them because he had knowledge of them all
 he had no need for any witness about man for he himself had knowledge of what was in man
 now on the first day of the week very early while it was still dark mary magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it
 then she went running to simon peter and to the other disciple who was loved by jesus and said to them they have taken away the lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him
 so peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead
 they went running together and the other disciple got in front of peter and came first to the hole in the rock
 and looking in he saw the linen bands on the earth but he did not go in
 then simon peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock and he saw the linen bands on the earth
 and the cloth which had been round his head not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself
 then the other disciple who came there first went in and he saw and belief came to him
 for at that time they had no knowledge that the writings said that he would have to come again from the dead
 so then the disciples went away again to their houses
 but mary was still there outside the hole in the rock weeping and while she was weeping and looking into the hole
 she saw two angels in white seated where the body of jesus had been one at the head and the other at the feet
 they said to her woman why are you weeping she said to them because they have taken away my lord and i have no knowledge where they have put him
 and then looking round she saw jesus there but had no idea that it was jesus
 jesus said to her woman why are you weeping who are you looking for she taking him for the gardener said to him sir if you have taken him away from here say where you have put him and i will take him away
 jesus said to her mary  turning she said to him in hebrew rabboni   which is to say master 
 jesus said to her do not put your hand on me for i have not gone up to the father but go to my brothers and say to them i go up to my father and your father to my god and your god
 mary magdalene went with the news to the disciples and said she had seen the lord and that he had said these things to her
 at evening on that day the first day of the week when for fear of the jews the doors were shut where the disciples were jesus came among them and said to them may peace be with you 
 and when he had said this he let them see his hands and his side then the disciples were glad when they saw the lord
 and jesus said to them again may peace be with you  as the father sent me even so i now send you
 and when he had said this breathing on them he said to them let the holy spirit come on you
 any to whom you give forgiveness will be made free from their sins and any from whom you keep back forgiveness will still be in their sins
 now thomas one of the twelve named didymus was not with them when jesus came
 so the other disciples said to him we have seen the lord but he said to them if i do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and if i do not put my hand into his side i will never have belief
 and after eight days his disciples were again in the house and thomas was with them though the doors were shut jesus came and taking his place in the middle of them he said may peace be with you 
 then he said to thomas put out your finger and see my hands and put your hand here into my side and be no longer in doubt but have belief
 and thomas said in answer my lord and my god 
 jesus said to him because you have seen me you have belief a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me 
 a number of other signs jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book
 but these are recorded so that you may have faith that jesus is the christ the son of god and so that having this faith you may have life in his name
 after these things jesus let himself be seen again by the disciples at the sea of tiberias and it came about in this way
 simon peter thomas named didymus nathanael of cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two others of his disciples were all together
 simon peter said to them i am going fishing they said to him and we will come with you they went out and got into the boat but that night they took no fish
 now very early in the morning jesus was there by the edge of the sea  though the disciples were not conscious that it was jesus 
 so jesus said to them children have you taken any fish they made answer no
 and he said to them let down the net on the right side of the boat and you will get some so they put it in the water and now they were not able to get it up again because of the great number of fish
 so the disciple who was dear to jesus said to peter it is the lord  hearing that it was the lord peter put his coat round him  because he was not clothed  and went into the sea
 and the other disciples came in the little boat  they were not far from land only about two hundred cubits off  pulling the net full of fish
 when they got to land they saw a fire of coals there with fish cooking on it and bread
 jesus said to them get some of the fish which you have now taken
 so peter went to the boat and came back pulling the net to land full of great fish a hundred and fifty three and though there was such a number the net was not broken
 jesus said to them come and take some food and all the disciples were in fear of putting the question who are you being conscious that it was the lord
 then jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them and the fish in the same way
 now this was the third time that jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead
 then when they had taken food jesus said to simon peter simon son of john is your love for me greater than the love of these others he said to him yes lord you are certain of my love for you he said to him then give my lambs food
 again a second time he said to him simon son of john have you any love for me yes lord he said you are certain of my love for you then take care of my sheep said jesus
 he said to him a third time simon son of john am i dear to you now peter was troubled in his heart because he put the question a third time am i dear to you and he said to him lord you have knowledge of all things you see that you are dear to me jesus said to him then give my sheep food
 truly i say to you when you were young you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go but when you are old you will put out your hands and another will make you ready and you will be taken where you have no desire to go
 now this he said pointing out the sort of death by which he would give god glory and after saying this he said to him come after me
 then peter turning round saw the disciple who was dear to jesus coming after them  the disciple who was resting on his breast at the last meal and said lord who is it who will be false to you
 seeing him peter said to jesus what about this man
 jesus said to him if it is my desire for him to be here till i come back what is that to you come yourself after me
 so this saying went about among the brothers that this disciple would not undergo death jesus however did not say that he would not undergo death but if it is my desire for him to be here till i come back what is that to you
 this is the disciple who gives witness about these things and who put them in writing and we have knowledge that his witness is true
 and jesus did such a number of other things that if every one was recorded it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be
 now there was among the pharisees a man named nicodemus who was one of the rulers of the jews
 he came to jesus by night and said to him rabbi we are certain that you have come from god as a teacher because no man would be able to do these signs which you do if god was not with him
 jesus said to him truly i say to you without a new birth no man is able to see the kingdom of god
 nicodemus said to him how is it possible for a man to be given birth when he is old is he able to go into his mothers body a second time and come to birth again
 jesus said in answer truly i say to you if a mans birth is not from water and from the spirit it is not possible for him to go into the kingdom of god
 that which has birth from the flesh is flesh and that which has birth from the spirit is spirit
 do not be surprised that i say to you it is necessary for you to have a second birth
 the wind goes where its pleasure takes it and the sound of it comes to your ears but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes so it is with everyone whose birth is from the spirit
 and nicodemus said to him how is it possible for these things to be
 and jesus answering said are you the teacher of israel and have no knowledge of these things
 truly i say to you we say that of which we have knowledge we give witness of what we have seen and you do not take our witness to be true
 if you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven
 and no one has ever gone up to heaven but he who came down from heaven the son of man
 as the snake was lifted up by moses in the waste land even so it is necessary for the son of man to be lifted up
 so that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life
 for god had such love for the world that he gave his only son so that whoever has faith in him may not come to destruction but have eternal life
 god did not send his son into the world to be judge of the world he sent him so that the world might have salvation through him
 the man who has faith in him does not come up to be judged but he who has no faith in him has been judged even now because he has no faith in the name of the only son of god
 and this is the test by which men are judged the light has come into the world and men have more love for the dark than for the light because their acts are evil
 the light is hated by everyone whose acts are evil and he does not come to the light for fear that his acts will be seen
 but he whose life is true comes to the light so that it may be clearly seen that his acts have been done by the help of god
 after these things jesus and his disciples went into the land of judaea and there he was with them for some time giving baptism
 now john was then giving baptism at aenon near salim because there was much water there and people came and were given baptism
 for at this time john had not been put into prison
 then a question came up between johns disciples and a jew about washing
 and they went to john and said to him rabbi the man who was with you on the other side of the jordan the man to whom you gave witness is now giving baptism and everyone is going to him
 and this was johns answer a man is unable to have anything if it is not given to him from heaven
 you yourselves give witness that i said i am not the christ what i said was i am sent before the christ
 he who has the bride is the husband but the husbands friend whose place is by his side and whose ears are open to him is full of joy because of the husbands voice such is my joy and it is complete
 he has to become greater while i become less
 he who comes from heaven is greater than all others he who comes from earth is of the earth and of the earth are his words he who comes from heaven is over all
 he gives witness of what he has seen and of what has come to his ears and no man takes his witness as true
 he who so takes his witness has made clear his faith that god is true
 for he whom god has sent says gods words and god does not give him the spirit by measure
 the father has love for the son and has put all things into his hands
 he who has faith in the son has eternal life but he who has not faith in the son will not see life gods wrath is resting on him
 now when it was clear to the lord that word had come to the ears of the pharisees that jesus was making more disciples than john and was giving them baptism
  though in fact it was his disciples who gave baptism not jesus himself 
 he went out of judaea into galilee again
 and it was necessary for him to go through samaria
 so he came to a town of samaria which was named sychar near to the bit of land which jacob gave to his son joseph
 now jacobs fountain was there jesus being tired after his journey was resting by the fountain it was about the sixth hour
 a woman of samaria came to get water and jesus said to her give me some water
 for his disciples had gone to the town to get food
 the woman of samaria said to him why do you a jew make a request for water to me a woman of samaria she said this because jews have nothing to do with the people of samaria
 in answer jesus said if you had knowledge of what god gives freely and who it is who says to you give me water you would make your prayer to him and he would give you living water
 the woman said to him sir you have no vessel and the fountain is deep from where will you get the living water
 are you greater than our father jacob who gave us the fountain and took the water of it himself with his children and his cattle
 jesus said to her everyone who takes this water will be in need of it again
 but whoever takes the water i give him will never be in need of drink again for the water i give him will become in him a fountain of eternal life
 the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i may not be in need again of drink and will not have to come all this way for it
 jesus said to her go get your husband and come back here with him
 in answer the woman said i have no husband jesus said to her you have said rightly i have no husband
 you have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband that was truly said
 the woman said to him sir i see that you are a prophet
 our fathers gave worship on this mountain but you jews say that the right place for worship is in jerusalem
 jesus said to her woman take my word for this the time is coming when you will not give worship to the father on this mountain or in jerusalem
 you give worship but without knowledge of what you are worshipping we give worship to what we have knowledge of for salvation comes from the jews
 but the time is coming and is even now here when the true worshippers will give worship to the father in the true way of the spirit for these are the worshippers desired by the father
 god is spirit then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit
 the woman said to him i am certain that the messiah who is named christ is coming when he comes he will make all things clear to us
 jesus said to her i who am talking to you am he
 at that point the disciples came back and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman but not one of them said to him what is your purpose or why are you talking to her
 then the woman put down her water pot and went into the town and said to the people
 come and see a man who has been talking to me of everything i ever did  is it possible that this is the christ
 so they went out of the town and came to him
 while this was taking place the disciples were saying to jesus master take some food
 but he said to them i have food of which you have no knowledge
 so the disciples said one to another did anyone give him food
 jesus said my food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete
 you would say four months from now is the time of the grain cutting take a look i say to you at the fields they are even now white for cutting
 he who does the cutting now has his reward he is getting together fruit for eternal life so that he who did the planting and he who gets in the grain may have joy together
 in this the saying is a true one one does the planting and another gets in the grain
 i sent you to get in grain which you had no hand in planting other men did that work and you take the reward
 now a number of the people of that town had faith in him because of the womans witness he has been talking to me of everything i ever did
 so when the people came to him they made request to him to be among them for a time and he was there two days
 and a great number more of them came to have faith in him because of what he himself said
 and they said to the woman now we have faith but not because of your story we ourselves have given ear to his words and we are certain that he is truly the saviour of the world
 and after the two days he went on from there into galilee
 for jesus himself said that a prophet has no honour in the country of his birth
 so when he came into galilee the galilaeans took him to their hearts because of the things which they had seen him do in jerusalem at the feast  they themselves having been there at the feast
 so he came to cana in galilee where he had made the water wine and there was a certain man of high position whose son was ill at capernaum
 when it came to his ears that jesus had come from judaea into galilee he went to him and made a request that he would come down to his son who was near to death and make him well
 then jesus said to him you will not have faith if you do not see signs and wonders
 the man said sir come down before my boy is dead
 and jesus said go in peace your son is living the man had faith in the word which jesus said to him and went away
 and while he was going down his servants came to him and said your boy is living
 so he put a question to them as to the hour when he became better and they said to him the disease went from him yesterday at the seventh hour
 it was clear then to the father that this was the very time at which jesus said to him your son is living and he had faith in jesus he and all his family
 now this is the second sign which jesus did after he had come out of judaea into galilee
 after these things there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem
 now in jerusalem near the sheep market there is a public bath which in hebrew is named beth zatha it has five doorways
 in these doorways there were a great number of people with different diseases some unable to see some without the power of walking some with wasted bodies
   
 one man was there who had been ill for thirty eight years
 when jesus saw him there on the floor it was clear to him that he had been now a long time in that condition and so he said to the man is it your desire to get well
 the ill man said in answer sir i have nobody to put me into the bath when the water is moving and while i am on the way down some other person gets in before me
 jesus said to him get up take your bed and go
 and the man became well straight away and took up his bed and went now that day was the sabbath
 so the jews said to the man who had been made well it is the sabbath and it is against the law for you to take up your bed
 he said to them but he who made me well said to me take up your bed and go
 then they put to him the question who is the man who said to you take it up and go
 now he who had been made well had no knowledge who it was jesus having gone away because of the number of people who were in that place
 after a time jesus came across him in the temple and said to him see you are well and strong do no more sin for fear a worse thing comes to you
 the man went away and said to the jews that it was jesus who had made him well
 and for this reason the jews were turned against jesus because he was doing these things on the sabbath
 but his answer was my father is still working even now and so i am working
 for this cause the jews had an even greater desire to put jesus to death because not only did he not keep the sabbath but he said god was his father so making himself equal with god
 so jesus made answer and said truly i say to you the son is not able to do anything himself he is able to do only what he sees the father doing whatever the father does the son does it in the same way
 for the father has love for the son and lets him see everything which he does and he will let him see greater works than these so that you may be full of wonder
 in the same way as the father gives life to the dead even so the son gives life to those to whom he is pleased to give it
 the father is not the judge of men but he has given all decisions into the hands of the son
 so that all men may give honour to the son even as they give honour to the father he who gives no honour to the son gives no honour to the father who sent him
 truly i say to you the man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me has eternal life he will not be judged but has come from death into life
 truly i say to you the time is coming it has even now come when the voice of the son of god will come to the ears of the dead and those hearing it will have life
 for even as the father has life in himself so he has given to the son to have life in himself
 and he has given him authority to be judge because he is the son of man
 do not be surprised at this for the time is coming when his voice will come to all who are in the place of the dead
 and they will come out those who have done good into the new life and those who have done evil to be judged
 of myself i am unable to do anything as the voice comes to me so i give a decision and my decision is right because i have no desire to do what is pleasing to myself but only what is pleasing to him who sent me
 if i gave witness about myself my witness would not be true
 there is another who gives witness about me and i am certain that the witness he gives about me is true
 you sent to john and he gave true witness
 but i have no need of a mans witness i only say these things so that you may have salvation
 he was a burning and shining light and for a time you were ready to be happy in his light
 but the witness which i have is greater than that of john the work which the father has given me to do the very work which i am now doing is a witness that the father has sent me
 and the father himself who sent me has given witness about me not one of you has ever given ear to his voice his form you have not seen
 and you have not kept his word in your hearts because you have not faith in him whom he has sent
 you make search in the holy writings in the belief that through them you get eternal life and it is those writings which give witness about me
 and still you have no desire to come to me so that you may have life
 i do not take honour from men
 but i have knowledge of you that you have no love for god in your hearts
 i have come in my fathers name and your hearts are not open to me if another comes with no other authority but himself you will give him your approval
 how is it possible for you to have faith while you take honour one from another and have no desire for the honour which comes from the only god
 put out of your minds the thought that i will say things against you to the father the one who says things against you is moses on whom you put your hopes
 if you had belief in moses you would have belief in me for his writings are about me
 if you have no belief in his writings how will you have belief in my words
 after these things jesus went away to the other side of the sea of galilee  that is the sea of tiberias
 and a great number of people went after him because they saw the signs which he did on those who were ill
 then jesus went up the mountain and was seated there with his disciples
 now the passover a feast of the jews was near
 lifting up his eyes jesus saw a great number of people coming to where he was and he said to philip where may we get bread for all these people
 this he said testing him for he had no doubt what he himself would do
 philip made answer bread to the value of two hundred pence would not be enough even to give everyone a little
 one of his disciples andrew the brother of simon peter said to jesus
 there is a boy here with five barley cakes and two fishes but what is that among such a number
 jesus said let the people be seated now there was much grass in that place and those seated on the grass were about five thousand
 then jesus took the cakes and having given praise to god he gave them to the people who were seated and the fishes in the same way as much as they had need of
 and when they had had enough jesus said to his disciples take up the broken bits which are over so that nothing may be wasted
 so they took them up twelve baskets full of broken bits of the five cakes which were over after the people had had enough
 and when the people saw the sign which he had done they said truly this is the prophet who is to come into the world
 now when jesus saw that the people were about to come and take him by force to make him a king he went away again up the mountain by himself
 when evening came the disciples went down to the sea
 and they took a boat and went across the sea in the direction of capernaum by then it was dark and still jesus had not come to them
 the sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing
 after they had gone three or four miles they saw jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat and they had great fear
 but he said to them it is i have no fear
 then they readily took him into the boat and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going
 the day after the people who were on the other side of the sea saw that only one small boat had been there that jesus had not gone in that boat with the disciples but that the disciples had gone away by themselves
 some other boats however came from tiberias near to the place where they had taken the bread after the lord had given praise
 so when the people saw that jesus was not there or his disciples they got into those boats and went over to capernaum looking for jesus
 and when they came across him on the other side of the sea they said rabbi when did you come here
 jesus answering them said truly i say to you you come after me not because you saw signs but because you were given the bread and had enough
 let your work not be for the food which comes to an end but for the food which goes on for eternal life which the son of man will give to you for on him has god the father put his mark
 then they said to him how may we do the works of god
 jesus answering said to them this is to do the work of god to have faith in him whom god has sent
 so they said what sign do you give us so that we may see and have faith in you what do you do
 our fathers had the manna in the waste land as the writings say he gave them bread from heaven
 jesus then said to them truly i say to you what moses gave you was not the bread from heaven it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven
 the bread of god is the bread which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world
 ah lord they said give us that bread for ever 
 and this was the answer of jesus i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never be in need of food and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink
 but it is as i said to you you have seen me and still you have no faith
 whatever the father gives to me will come to me and i will not send away anyone who comes to me
 for i have come down from heaven not to do my pleasure but the pleasure of him who sent me
 and this is the pleasure of him who sent me that i am not to let out of my hands anything which he has given me but i am to give it new life on the last day
 this i say is my fathers pleasure that everyone who sees the son and has faith in him may have eternal life and i will take him up on the last day
 now the jews said bitter things about jesus because of his words i am the bread which came down from heaven
 and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we have seen how is it then that he now says i have come down from heaven
 jesus made answer and said do not say things against me one to another
 no man is able to come to me if the father who sent me does not give him the desire to come and i will take him up from the dead on the last day
 the writings of the prophets say and they will all have teaching from god everyone whose ears have been open to the teaching of the father comes to me
 not that anyone has ever seen the father only he who is from god he has seen the father
 truly i say to you he who has faith in me has eternal life
 i am the bread of life
 your fathers took the manna in the waste land  and they are dead
 the bread which comes from heaven is such bread that a man may take it for food and never see death
 i am the living bread which has come from heaven if any man takes this bread for food he will have life for ever and more than this the bread which i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world
 then the jews had an angry discussion among themselves saying how is it possible for this man to give us his flesh for food
 then jesus said to them truly i say to you if you do not take the flesh of the son of man for food and if you do not take his blood for drink you have no life in you
 he who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life and i will take him up from the dead at the last day
 my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink
 he who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink is in me and i in him
 as the living father has sent me and i have life because of the father even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me
 this is the bread which has come down from heaven it is not like the food which your fathers had they took of the manna and are dead but he who takes this bread for food will have life for ever
 jesus said these things in the synagogue while he was teaching at capernaum
 then hearing this a number of his disciples said this is a hard saying who is able to take in such teaching
 when jesus became conscious that his disciples were protesting about what he said he said to them does this give you trouble
 what then will you say if you see the son of man going up to where he was before
 the spirit is the life giver the flesh is of no value the words which i have said to you are spirit and they are life
 but still some of you have no faith for it was clear to jesus from the first who they were who had no faith and who it was who would be false to him
 and he said this is why i said to you no man is able to come to me if he is not given the power to do so by the father
 because of what he said a number of the disciples went back and would no longer go with him
 so jesus said to the twelve have you a desire to go away
 then simon peter gave this answer lord to whom are we to go you have the words of eternal life
 and we have faith and are certain that you are the holy one of god
 then jesus said did i not make a selection of you the twelve and one of you is a son of the evil one
 he was talking of judas the son of simon iscariot it was he who was to be false to jesus  one of the twelve
 after this jesus went from place to place in galilee he did not go about in judaea because the jews were looking for a chance to put him to death
 but the feast of the jews the feast of tents was near
 so his brothers said to him go away from here into judaea so that your disciples may see the works which you do
 because no man does things secretly if he has a desire that men may have knowledge of him if you do these things let yourself be seen by all men
 for even his brothers had no belief in him
 jesus said to them my time is still to come but any time is good for you
 it is not possible for you to be hated by the world but i am hated by it because i give witness that what it does is evil
 go you up to the feast i am not going up now to the feast because my time has not fully come
 having said these things to them he still kept in galilee
 but after his brothers had gone up to the feast then he went up not publicly but in secret
 at the feast the jews were looking for him and saying where is he
 and there was much discussion about him among the mass of the people some said he is a good man but others said no he is giving people false ideas
 but no man said anything about him openly for fear of the jews
 now in the middle of the feast jesus went up to the temple and was teaching
 then the jews were surprised and said how has this man got knowledge of books he has never been to school
 jesus gave them this answer it is not my teaching but his who sent me
 if any man is ready to do gods pleasure he will have knowledge of the teaching and of where it comes from  from god or from myself
 the man whose words come from himself is looking for glory for himself but he who is looking for the glory of him who sent him  that man is true and there is no evil in him
 did not moses give you the law even so not one of you keeps the law why have you a desire to put me to death
 the people said in answer you have an evil spirit who has any desire to put you to death
 this was the answer of jesus i have done one work and you are all surprised at it
 moses gave you circumcision  not that it comes from moses but from the fathers  and even on the sabbath you give a child circumcision
 if a child is given circumcision on the sabbath so that the law of moses may not be broken why are you angry with me because i made a man completely well on the sabbath
 let not your decisions be based on what you see but on righteousness
 then some of the people of jerusalem said is not this the man whose death is desired
 and here he is talking openly and they say nothing to him  is it possible that the rulers have knowledge that this is truly the christ
 however it is clear to us where this man comes from but when the christ comes no one will have knowledge where he comes from
 then when he was teaching in the temple jesus said with a loud voice you have knowledge of me and you have knowledge of where i come from and i have not come of myself but there is one who has sent me he is true but you have no knowledge of him
 i have knowledge of him because i came from him and he sent me
 then they had a desire to take him but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come
 and numbers of the people had belief in him and they said when the christ comes will he do more signs than this man has done
 this discussion of the people came to the ears of the pharisees and the chief priests and the pharisees sent servants to take him
 then jesus said i will be with you a little longer and then i go to him who sent me
 you will be looking for me and you will not see me and where i am you may not come
 so the jews said among themselves to what place is he going where we will not see him will he go to the jews living among the greeks and become the teacher of the greeks
 what is this saying of his you will be looking for me and will not see me and where i am you may not come
 on the last day the great day of the feast jesus got up and said in a loud voice if any man is in need of drink let him come to me and i will give it to him
 he who has faith in me out of his body as the writings have said will come rivers of living water
 this he said of the spirit which would be given to those who had faith in him the spirit had not been given then because the glory of jesus was still to come
 when these words came to their ears some of the people said this is certainly the prophet
 others said this is the christ but others said not so will the christ come from galilee
 do not the writings say that the christ comes of the seed of david and from beth lehem the little town where david was
 so there was a division among the people because of him
 and some of them had a desire to take him but no man put hands on him
 then the servants went back to the chief priests and pharisees who said to them why have you not got him with you
 the servants made answer no man ever said things like this man
 then the pharisees said to them have you like the others been given false ideas
 have any of the rulers belief in him or any one of the pharisees
 but these people who have no knowledge of the law are cursed
 nicodemus  he who had come to jesus before being himself one of them  said to them
 is a man judged by our law before it has given him a hearing and has knowledge of what he has done
 this was their answer and do you come from galilee make search and you will see that no prophet comes out of galilee
  and every man went to his house
 but jesus went to the mountain of olives
 and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came to him and he was seated teaching them
 now the scribes and pharisees came with a woman who had been taken in the act of sinning against the married relation
 and putting her forward they said to him master this woman has been taken in the very act of sinning against the married relation
 now in the law moses gave directions that such women were to be stoned what do you say about it
 they said this testing him so that they might have something against him but jesus with his head bent down made letters on the floor with his finger
 but when they went on with their questions he got up and said to them let him among you who is without sin be the first to send a stone at her
 and again with bent head he made letters on the floor
 and when his words came to their ears they went out one by one starting with the oldest even to the last because they were conscious of what was in their hearts and jesus was there by himself with the woman before him
 then jesus got up and seeing nobody but the woman he said to her where are the men who said things against you did no one give a decision against you
 and she said no man lord and jesus said and i do not give a decision against you go and never do wrong again 
 then again jesus said to them i am the light of the world he who comes with me will not be walking in the dark but will have the light of life
 so the pharisees said to him the witness you give is about yourself your witness is not true
 jesus said in answer even if i give witness about myself my witness is true because i have knowledge of where i came from and where i am going but you have no knowledge of where i come from or of where i am going
 you are judging from what you see i am judging no man
 even if i am judging my decision is right because i am not by myself  with me is the father who sent me
 even in your law it is said that the witness of two men is true
 i give witness about myself and the father who sent me gives witness about me
 then they said to him where is your father jesus said in answer you have no knowledge of me or of my father if you had knowledge of me you would have knowledge of my father
 jesus said these words in the place where the offerings were stored while he was teaching in the temple but no man took him because his time was still to come
 then he said to them again i am going away and you will be looking for me but death will overtake you in your sins it is not possible for you to come where i am going
 so the jews said will he take his life is that why he says where i go it is not possible for you to come
 and he said to them you are of the earth i am from heaven you are of this world i am not of this world
 for this reason i said to you that death will overtake you in your sins for if you have not faith that i am he death will come to you while you are in your sins
 then they said to him who are you jesus said what i said to you from the first
 i have much to say about you and against you but he who sent me is true and what he has said to me i say to the world
 they did not see that his words were about the father
 so jesus said when the son of man has been lifted up by you then it will be clear to you who i am and that i do nothing of myself but say as the father gave me teaching
 he who sent me is with me he has not gone from me because at all times i do the things which are pleasing to him
 when he said this a number came to have faith in him
 then jesus said to the jews who had faith in him if you keep my word then you are truly my disciples
 and you will have knowledge of what is true and that will make you free
 they said to him in answer we are abrahams seed and have never been any mans servant why do you say you will become free
 and this was the answer jesus gave them truly i say to you everyone who does evil is the servant of sin
 now the servant does not go on living in the house for ever but the son does
 if then the son makes you free you will be truly free
 i am conscious that you are abrahams seed but you have a desire to put me to death because my word has no place in you
 i say the things which i have seen in my fathers house and you do the things which come to you from your fathers house
 in answer they said to him our father is abraham jesus said to them if you were abrahams children you would do what abraham did
 but now you have a desire to put me to death a man who has said to you what is true as i had it from god abraham did not do that
 you are doing the works of your father they said to him we are true sons of abraham we have one father who is god
 jesus said to them if god was your father you would have love for me because it was from god i came and am here i did not come of myself but he sent me
 why are my words not clear to you it is because your ears are shut to my teaching
 you are the children of your father the evil one and it is your pleasure to do his desires from the first he was a taker of life and he did not go in the true way because there is no true thing in him when he says what is false it is natural to him for he is false and the father of what is false
 but because i say what is true you have no belief in me
 which of you is able truly to say that i am a sinner if i say what is true why have you no belief in me
 he who is a child of god gives ear to the words of god your ears are not open to them because you are not from god
 the jews said to him in answer are we not right in saying that you are of samaria and have an evil spirit
 and this was the answer of jesus i have not an evil spirit but i give honour to my father and you do not give honour to me
 i however am not in search of glory for myself there is one who is searching for it and he is judge
 truly i say to you if a man keeps my word he will never see death
 the jews said to him now we are certain that you have an evil spirit abraham is dead and the prophets are dead and you say if a man keeps my word he will never see death
 are you greater than our father abraham who is dead and the prophets are dead who do you say that you are
 jesus said in answer if i take glory for myself my glory is nothing it is my father who gives me glory of whom you say that he is your god
 you have no knowledge of him but i have knowledge of him and if i said i have no knowledge of him i would be talking falsely like you but i have full knowledge of him and i keep his word
 your father abraham was full of joy at the hope of seeing my day he saw it and was glad
 then the jews said to him you are not fifty years old have you seen abraham
 jesus said to them truly i say to you before abraham came into being i am
 so they took up stones to send at him but jesus got secretly out of their way and went out of the temple
 and when he went on his way he saw a man blind from birth
 and his disciples put a question to him saying master was it because of this mans sin or the sin of his father and mother that he has been blind from birth
 jesus said in answer it was not because of his sin or because of his fathers or mothers it was so that the works of god might be seen openly in him
 while it is day we have to do the works of him who sent me the night comes when no work may be done
 as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
 having said these words he put earth mixed with water from his mouth on the mans eyes
 and said to him go and make yourself clean in the bath of siloam  the sense of the name is sent  so he went away and after washing came back able to see
 then the neighbours and others who had seen him before in the street with his hand out for money said is not this the man who got money from people
 some said it is he others said no but he is like him he said i am he
 so they said to him how then were your eyes made open
 his answer was the man who is named jesus put earth mixed with water on my eyes and said to me go and make yourself clean in siloam so i went away and after washing am now able to see
 and they said to him where is he his answer was i have no knowledge
 they took him before the pharisees  this man who had been blind
 now the day on which the earth was mixed by jesus and the mans eyes were made open was the sabbath
 so the pharisees put more questions to him about how his eyes had been made open and he said to them he put earth on my eyes and i had a wash and am able to see
 then some of the pharisees said that man has not come from god for he does not keep the sabbath others said how is it possible for a sinner to do such signs so there was a division among them
 again they said to the blind man what have you to say about him for opening your eyes and he said he is a prophet
 now the jews had no belief in the statement that he had been blind and was now able to see till they sent for the father and mother of the man whose eyes had been made open
 and put the question to them saying is this your son of whom you say that he was blind at birth how is it then that he is now able to see
 in answer his father and mother said we are certain that this is our son and that he was blind at birth
 but how it is he is now able to see or who made his eyes open we are not able to say put the question to him he is old enough to give an answer for himself
 they said this because of their fear of the jews for the jews had come to an agreement that if any man said that jesus was the christ he would be put out of the synagogue
 that was the reason why they said he is old enough put the question to him
 so they sent a second time for the man who had been blind and they said to him give glory to god it is clear to us that this man is a sinner
 he said in answer i have no knowledge if he is a sinner or not but one thing i am certain about i was blind and now i see
 then they said to him what did he do to you how did he give you the use of your eyes
 his answer was i have said it before but your ears were shut why would you have me say it again is it your desire to become his disciples
 and they were angry with him and said you are his disciple but we are disciples of moses
 we are certain that god gave his word to moses but as for this man we have no knowledge where he comes from
 the man said in answer why here is a strange thing  you have no knowledge where he comes from though he gave me the use of my eyes
 we have knowledge that god does not give ear to sinners but if any man is a worshipper of god and does his pleasure to him gods ears are open
 in all the years nobody has ever before seen the eyes of a man blind from birth made open
 if this man did not come from god he would be unable to do anything
 their answer was you came to birth through sin do you make yourself our teacher and they put him out of the synagogue
 it came to the ears of jesus that they had put him out and meeting him he said have you faith in the son of man
 he said in answer and who is he lord say so that i may have faith in him
 jesus said to him you have seen him it is he who is talking to you
 and he said lord i have faith and he gave him worship
 and jesus said i came into this world to be a judge so that those who do not see may see and those who see may become blind
 these words came to the ears of the pharisees who were with him and they said to him are we then blind
 jesus said to them if you were blind you would have no sin but now that you say we see your sin is there still
 jude a servant of jesus christ and the brother of james to those of gods selection who have been made holy by god the father and are kept safe for jesus christ
 may mercy and peace and love be increased in you
 my loved ones while my thoughts were full of a letter which i was going to send you about our common salvation it was necessary for me to send you one requesting you with all my heart to go on fighting strongly for the faith which has been given to the saints once and for ever
 for certain men have come among you secretly marked out before in the holy writings for this evil fate men without the fear of god turning his grace into an unclean thing and false to our only master and lord jesus christ
 now it is my purpose to put you in mind though you once had knowledge of all these things of how the lord having taken a people safely out of egypt later sent destruction on those who had no faith
 and the angels who did not keep to their kingdom but went out from the place which was theirs he has put in eternal chains and in dark night till the great day of the judging
 even as sodom and gomorrah and the towns near them having like these given themselves up to unclean desires and gone after strange flesh have been made an example undergoing the punishment of eternal fire
 in the same way these dreamers make the flesh unclean having no respect for authorities and say evil of rulers
 now when michael one of the chief angels was fighting against the evil one for the body of moses fearing to make use of violent words against him he only said may the lord be your judge
 but these men say evil about such things as they have no knowledge of and the things of which they have natural knowledge like beasts without reason are the cause of their destruction
 a curse on them  they have gone in the way of cain running uncontrolled into the error of balaam for reward and have come to destruction by saying evil against the lord like korah
 these men are unseen rocks at your love feasts when they take part in them with you keepers of sheep who without fear take the food of the sheep clouds without water rushing before the wind wasted trees without fruit twice dead pulled up by the roots
 violent waves of the sea streaming with their shame wandering stars for whom the darkest night is kept in store for ever
 the prophet enoch who was the seventh after adam said of these men the lord came with tens of thousands of his saints
 to be the judge of all and to give a decision against all those whose lives are unpleasing to him because of the evil acts which they have done and because of all the hard things which sinners without fear of god have said against him
 these are the men who make trouble ever desiring change going after evil pleasures using high sounding words respecting mens position in the hope of reward
 but you my loved ones keep in memory the words which were said before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ
 how they said to you in the last days there will be men who guided by their evil desires will make sport of holy things
 these are the men who make divisions natural men not having the spirit
 but you my loved ones building yourselves up on your most holy faith and making prayers in the holy spirit
 keep yourselves in the love of god looking for life eternal through the mercy of our lord jesus christ
 and have pity on those who are in doubt
 and to some give salvation pulling them out of the fire and on some have mercy with fear hating even the clothing which is made unclean by the flesh
 now to him who is able to keep you from falling and to give you a place in his glory free from all evil with great joy
 to the only god our saviour through jesus christ our lord let us give glory and honour and authority and power before all time and now and for ever so be it
 as a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us
 as they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word
 it seemed good to me having made observation with great care of the direction of events in their order to put the facts in writing for you most noble theophilus
 so that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching
 in the days of herod king of judaea there was a certain priest by name zacharias of the order of abijah and he had a wife of the family of aaron and her name was elisabeth
 they were upright in the eyes of god keeping all the rules and orders of god and doing no wrong
 and they were without children because elisabeth had never given birth and they were at that time very old
 now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before god
 and as was the way of the priests he had to go into the temple to see to the burning of perfumes
 and all the people were offering prayers outside at the time of the burning of perfumes
 and he saw an angel of the lord in his place on the right side of the altar
 and zacharias was troubled when he saw him and fear came on him
 but the angel said have no fear zacharias for your prayer has come to the ears of god and your wife elisabeth will have a son and his name will be john
 and you will be glad and have great delight and numbers of people will have joy at his birth
 for he will be great in the eyes of the lord he will not take wine or strong drink and he will be full of the spirit of god from his birth
 and through him great numbers of the children of israel will be turned to the lord their god
 and he will go before his face in the spirit and power of elijah turning the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the lord
 and zacharias said to the angel how may i be certain of this for i am an old man and my wife is far on in years
 and the angel answering said i am gabriel whose place is before god i have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news
 now see you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about because you had not faith in my words which will have effect at the right time
 and the people were waiting for zacharias and were surprised because he was in the temple for such a long time
 and when he came out he was not able to say anything and they saw that he had seen a vision in the temple and he was making signs to them without words
 and when the days of his work in the temple were ended he went back to his house
 after that time elisabeth being certain that she was to become a mother kept herself from mens eyes for five months saying
 the lord has done this to me for his eyes were on me to take away my shame in the eyes of men
 now in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god to a town in galilee named nazareth
 to a virgin who was to be married to a man named joseph of the family of david and the name of the virgin was mary
 and the angel came in to her and said peace be with you to whom special grace has been given the lord is with you
 but she was greatly troubled at his words and said to herself what may be the purpose of these words
 and the angel said to her have no fear mary for you have gods approval
 and see you will give birth to a son and his name will be jesus
 he will be great and will be named the son of the most high and the lord god will give him the kingdom of david his father
 he will have rule over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there will be no end
 and mary said to the angel how may this be because i have had no knowledge of a man
 and the angel in answer said to her the holy spirit will come on you and the power of the most high will come to rest on you and so that which will come to birth will be named holy son of god
 even now elisabeth who is of your family is to be a mother though she is old and this is the sixth month with her who was without children
 for there is nothing which god is not able to do
 and mary said i am the servant of the lord may it be to me as you say and the angel went away
 then mary got up and went quickly into the high lands to a town of judah
 and went into the house of zacharias and took elisabeth in her arms
 and when the voice of mary came to the ears of elisabeth the baby made a sudden move inside her then elisabeth was full of the holy spirit
 and she said with a loud voice may blessing be on you among women and a blessing on the child of your body
 how is it that the mother of my lord comes to me
 for truly when the sound of your voice came to my ears the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy
 happy will she be who had faith that the things which the lord has said to her will be done
 and mary said my soul gives glory to god
 my spirit is glad in god my saviour
 for he has had pity on his servant though she is poor and lowly placed and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me
 for he who is strong has done great things for me and holy is his name
 his mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him
 with his arm he has done acts of power he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts
 he has put down kings from their seats lifting up on high the men of low degree
 those who had no food he made full of good things the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands
 his help he has given to israel his servant so that he might keep in mind his mercy to abraham and his seed for ever
 as he gave his word to our fathers
 and mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house
 now it was time for elisabeth to give birth and she had a son
 and it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the lord had been very good to her and they took part in her joy
 and on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child and they would have given him the name of zacharias his fathers name
 but his mother made answer and said no his name is john
 and they said not one of your relations has that name
 and they made signs to his father to say what name was to be given to him
 and he sent for writing materials and put down his name is john and they were all surprised
 and straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to god
 and fear came on all those who were living round about them and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill country of judaea
 and all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said what will this child be for the hand of the lord was with him
 and his father zacharias was full of the holy spirit and with the voice of a prophet said these words
 praise be to the lord the god of israel for he has come to his people and made them free
 lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david
  as he said by the mouth of his holy prophets from the earliest times 
 salvation from those who are against us and from the hands of those who have hate for us
 to do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word
 the oath which he made to abraham our father
 that we being made free from the fear of those who are against us might give him worship
 in righteousness and holy living before him all our days
 and you child will be named the prophet of the most high you will go before the face of the lord to make ready his ways
 to give knowledge of salvation to his people through the forgiveness of sins
 because of the loving mercies of our god by which the dawn from heaven has come to us
 to give light to those in dark places and in the shade of death so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace
 and the child became tall and strong in spirit and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of israel
 now after these things the lord made selection of seventy others and sent them before him two together into every town and place where he himself was about to come
 and he said to them there is much grain ready to be cut but not enough workers so make prayer to the lord of the grain fields that he will send workers to get in the grain
 go on your way see i send you out like lambs among wolves
 take no bag for money or for food and no shoes say no word to any man on the way
 and whenever you go into a house first say peace be to this house
 and if a son of peace is there your peace will be with him but if not it will come back to you again
 and keep in that same house taking what food and drink they give you for the worker has a right to his reward do not go from house to house
 and into whatever town you go if they take you in take whatever food is given to you
 and make well those in it who are ill and say to them the kingdom of god is near to you
 but if you go into a town where they will not have you go out into the streets of it and say
 even the dust of your town which is on our feet we put off as a witness against you but be certain of this that the kingdom of god is near
 i say to you it will be better in that day for sodom than for that town
 a curse is on you chorazin  a curse is on you beth saida  for if such works of power had been done in tyre and sidon as have been done in you they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by seated in the dust
 but it will be better for tyre and sidon in the day of judging than for you
 and you capernaum were you not lifted up to heaven you will go down to hell
 whoever gives ear to you gives ear to me and whoever is against you is against me and whoever is against me is against him who sent me
 and the seventy came back with joy saying lord even the evil spirits are under our power in your name
 and he said i was watching for satan falling from heaven like a star
 see i have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts and over all the strength of him who is against you and nothing will do you damage
 do not be glad however because you have power over spirits but because your names are recorded in heaven
 in that same hour he was full of joy in the holy spirit and said i give praise to you o father lord of heaven and earth because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning and have made them clear to little children for so o father it was pleasing in your eyes
 all things have been given to me by my father and no one has knowledge of the son but only the father and of the father but only the son and he to whom the son will make it clear
 and turning to the disciples he said privately happy are the eyes which see the things you see
 for i say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears and they had it not
 and a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test saying master what have i to do so that i may have eternal life
 and he said to him what does the law say in your reading of it
 and he answering said have love for the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and for your neighbour as for yourself
 and he said you have given the right answer do this and you will have life
 but he desiring to put himself in the right said to jesus and who is my neighbour
 and jesus answering him said a certain man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and he got into the hands of thieves who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows and when they went away he was half dead
 and by chance a certain priest was going down that way and when he saw him he went by on the other side
 and in the same way a levite when he came to the place and saw him went by on the other side
 but a certain man of samaria journeying that way came where he was and when he saw him he was moved with pity for him
 and came to him and put clean linen round his wounds with oil and wine and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him
 and the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said take care of him and if this money is not enough when i come again i will give you whatever more is needed
 which of these three men in your opinion was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves
 and he said the one who had mercy on him and jesus said go and do the same
 now while they were on their way he came to a certain town and a woman named martha took him into her house
 and she had a sister by name mary who took her seat at the lords feet and gave attention to his words
 but martha had her hands full of the work of the house and she came to him and said lord is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work say to her that she is to give me some help
 but the lord answering said to her martha martha you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things
 little is needed or even one thing only for mary has taken that good part which will not be taken away from her
 and it came about that he was in prayer in a certain place and when he came to an end one of his disciples said to him lord will you give us teaching about prayer as john did to his disciples
 and he said to them when you say your prayers say father may your name be kept holy and your kingdom come
 give us every day bread for our needs
 may we have forgiveness for our sins as we make free all those who are in debt to us and let us not be put to the test
 and he said to them which of you having a friend would go to him in the middle of the night and say to him friend let me have three cakes of bread
 because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey and i have nothing to put before him
 and he from inside the house would say in answer do not be a trouble to me the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed it is not possible for me to get up and give to you
 i say to you though he will not get up and give to him because he is his friend still if he keeps on making his request he will get up and give him as much as he has need of
 and i say to you make requests and they will be answered what you are searching for you will get when you give the sign the door will be open to you
 for to everyone who makes a request it will be given and he who is searching will get his desire and to him who gives the sign the door will be open
 and which of you being a father will give a stone to his son who makes request for bread or for a fish will give him a snake
 or for an egg will give him a scorpion
 if then you who are evil are able to give good things to your children how much more will your father in heaven give the holy spirit to those who make request to him
 and he was sending an evil spirit out of a man who was without the power of talking and it came about that when the spirit had gone the man had the power of talking and the people were full of wonder
 but some of them said he sends out evil spirits by beelzebul the ruler of evil spirits
 and others testing him were looking for a sign from heaven from him
 but he having knowledge of their thoughts said to them every kingdom in which there is division is made waste and a house in which there is division comes to destruction
 if then satan is at war with himself how will he keep his kingdom because you say that i send evil spirits out of men by the help of beelzebul
 and if i by beelzebul send out evil spirits by whose help do your sons send them out so let them be your judges
 but if i by the finger of god send out evil spirits then the kingdom of god has overtaken you
 when the strong man armed keeps watch over his house then his goods are safe
 but when one who is stronger makes an attack on him and overcomes him he takes away his instruments of war in which he had put his faith and makes division of his goods
 he who is not with me is against me and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away
 the unclean spirit when he has gone out of a man goes through dry places looking for rest and when he does not get it he says i will go back to my house from which i came
 and when he comes he sees that it has been made fair and clean
 then he goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than himself and they go in and take their places there and the last condition of that man is worse than the first
 and it came about that when he said these things a certain woman among the people said in a loud voice happy is the body which gave you birth and the breasts from which you took milk
 but he said more happy are they who give hearing to the word of god and keep it
 and when a great number of people came together to him he said this generation is an evil generation it is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of jonah
 for even as jonah became a sign to the ninevites so will the son of man be to this generation
 the queen of the south will come up on the day of judging and give her decision against the men of this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of solomon and now something greater than solomon is here
 the men of nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation for they were turned away from their sins at the preaching of jonah but now something greater than jonah is here
 no man when the light has been lighted puts it in a secret place or under a vessel but on its table so that those who come in may see the light
 the light of the body is the eye when your eye is true all your body is full of light but when it is evil your body is dark
 so take care that the light which is in you is not dark
 if then all your body is light with no part of it dark it will be completely full of light as when a flame with its bright shining gives you light
 now while he was talking a pharisee made a request that he would come to a meal with him and he went in and took his seat at the meal
 and when the pharisee saw it he was surprised because he came to the meal without first washing himself
 and the lord said to him you pharisees make the outside of the cup and the plate clean but inside you are thieves and full of evil
 o you foolish ones  did not he who made the outside in the same way make the inside
 but if you give to the poor such things as you are able then all things are clean to you
 but a curse is on you pharisees  for you make men give a tenth of every sort of plant and give no thought to right and the love of god but it is right for you to do these things and not let the others be undone
 a curse is on you pharisees  for your desires are for the most important seats in the synagogues and for words of respect said to you in the market place
 a curse is on you  for you are like the resting places of dead men which are not seen and men go walking over them without knowledge of it
 and one of the teachers of the law answering said to him master in saying this you give a bad name to us as to them
 and he said a curse is on you teachers of the law  for while other men are crushed under the weight of the rules you make for them you yourselves do not put so much as one finger to them
 a curse is on you  for you make resting places for the bodies of the prophets but your fathers put them to death
 so you are witnesses and give approval to the work of your fathers for they put them to death and you make their last resting places
 for this reason the wisdom of god has said i will send them prophets and teachers and to some of them they will give death and cruel pains
 so that punishment may come on this generation for the blood of all the prophets which was given from the earliest days
 from the blood of abel to the blood of zachariah who was put to death between the altar and the temple yes i say to you it will come on this generation
 a curse is on you teachers of the law  for you have taken away the key of knowledge you did not go in yourselves and you got in the way of those who were going in
 and when he had come out of that place the scribes and the pharisees came round him angrily questioning him about more things
 and watching him for a chance to get something from his words which might be used against him
 at that time when thousands of the people had come together in such numbers that they were crushing one another he said first to his disciples have nothing to do with the leaven of the pharisees which is deceit
 but nothing is covered up which will not come to light or secret which will not be made clear
 so whatever you have said in the dark will come to mens hearing in the light and what you have said secretly inside the house will be made public from the house tops
 and i say to you my friends have no fear of those who may put the body to death and are able to do no more than that
 but i will make clear to you of whom you are to be in fear of him who after death has power to send you to hell yes truly i say have fear of him
 are not five sparrows given in exchange for two farthings and god has every one of them in mind
 but even the hairs of your head are numbered have no fear you are of more value than a flock of sparrows
 and i say to you that to everyone who gives witness to me before men the son of man will give witness before the angels of god
 but if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me i will say that i have no knowledge of him before the angels of god
 and if anyone says a word against the son of man he will have forgiveness but for him who says evil words against the holy spirit there will be no forgiveness
 and when they take you before the synagogues and the authorities and the rulers take no thought about what answers you will give or what you will say
 for the holy spirit will make clear to you in that very hour what to say
 and one of the people said to him master give an order to my brother to make division of the heritage with me
 but he said man who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you
 and he said to them take care to keep yourselves free from the desire for property for a mans life is not made up of the number of things which he has
 and he said to them in a story the land of a certain man of great wealth was very fertile
 and he said to himself what is to be done for i have no place in which to put all my fruit
 and he said this i will do i will take down my store houses and make greater ones and there i will put all my grain and my goods
 and i will say to my soul soul you have a great amount of goods in store enough for a number of years be at rest take food and wine and be happy
 but god said to him you foolish one tonight i will take your soul from you and who then will be the owner of all the things which you have got together
 so that is what comes to the man who gets wealth for himself and has not wealth in the eyes of god
 and he said to his disciples for this reason i say to you take no thought for your life about what food you will take or for your body how it may be clothed
 is not life more than food and the body than its clothing
 give thought to the ravens they do not put seeds into the earth or get together grain they have no store houses or buildings and god gives them their food of how much greater value are you than the birds 
 and which of you by taking thought is able to make himself any taller
 if then you are not able to do even that which is least why are you troubled about the rest
 give thought to the flowers they do no work they make no thread and still i say to you even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
 but if god gives such clothing to the grass in the field which today is living and tomorrow will be burned in the oven how much more will he give clothing to you o men of little faith
 and do not give overmuch thought to your food and drink and let not your mind be full of doubts
 for the nations of the world go in search of all these things but your father has knowledge that you have need of them
 but let your chief care be for his kingdom and these other things will be given to you in addition
 have no fear little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
 give what property you have in exchange for money and give the money to the poor make for yourselves money bags which will not get old wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction
 for where your wealth is there will your heart be
 be ready dressed as for a journey with your lights burning
 and be like men who are looking for their lord when he comes back from the bride feast so that when he comes to the door it will be open to him quickly
 happy are those servants who are watching when the lord comes truly i say to you he will make himself their servant and placing them at the table he will come out and give them food
 and if he comes in the second division of the night or in the third and they are watching for him happy are those servants
 but be certain of this that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming he would have been watching and would not have let his house be broken into
 so be ready for the son of man is coming at a time when you are not looking for him
 and peter said to him lord are these words said to us only or to all men
 and the lord said who then is the wise and responsible servant whom his lord will put in control of his family to give them their food at the right time
 happy is that servant who when his lord comes is doing so
 truly i say to you he will put him in control of all his goods
 but if that servant says to himself my lord is a long time coming and goes about giving blows to the men servants and the women servants feasting and taking overmuch wine
 the lord of that servant will come at a time when he is not looking for him and at an hour when he is not ready for him and he will have him cut in two and will give him his part in the fate of those who have no faith
 and the servant who had knowledge of his lords desires and was not ready for him and did not do as he was ordered will be given a great number of blows
 but he who without knowledge did things for which punishment is given will get only a small number of blows the man to whom much is given will have to give much if much is given into his care of him more will be requested
 i came to send a fire on the earth and it may even now have been lighted
 but there is a baptism which i have to undergo and how am i kept back till it is complete 
 is it your opinion that i have come to give peace on earth i say to you no but division
 for from this time a family of five in one house will be on opposite sides three against two and two against three
 they will be at war the father against his son and the son against his father mother against daughter and daughter against mother mother in law against daughter in law and daughter in law against mother in law
 then he said to the people when you see a cloud coming up in the west straight away you say there will be rain and so it is
 and when you see a south wind blowing you say there will be heat and so it is
 o false ones  the face of the earth and the heaven is clear to you how is it that the signs of these times are not as clear to you
 and why are you in your hearts unable to be judges of what is right
 for if anyone has a cause at law against you and you are going with him before the ruler make an attempt on the way to come to an agreement with him for if you do not he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police and they will put you in prison
 i say to you you will not come out of it till you have made payment to the very last farthing
 now some people who were there at that time gave him an account of how the blood of some galilaeans had been mixed by pilate with their offerings
 and he in answer said to them are you of the opinion that these galilaeans were worse than all other galilaeans because these things were done to them
 i say to you it is not so but if your hearts are not changed you will all come to the same end
 or those eighteen men who were crushed by the fall of the tower of siloam were they worse than all the other men living in jerusalem
 i say to you it is not so but if your hearts are not changed you will all come to an end in the same way
 and he made up this story for them a certain man had a fig tree in his garden and he came to get fruit from it and there was no fruit
 and he said to the gardener see for three years i have been looking for fruit from this tree and i have not had any let it be cut down why is it taking up space
 and he said lord let it be for this year and i will have the earth turned up round it and put animal waste on it to make it fertile
 and if after that it has fruit it is well if not let it be cut down
 and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
 and there was a woman who had had a disease for eighteen years she was bent and was not able to make herself straight
 and when jesus saw her he said to her woman you are made free from your disease
 and he put his hands on her and she was made straight and gave praise to god
 and the ruler of the synagogue was angry because jesus had made her well on the sabbath and he said to the people there are six days in which men may do work so come on those days to be made well and not on the sabbath
 but the lord gave him an answer and said o you false men  do you not every one of you on the sabbath let loose his ox and his ass and take it to the water
 and is it not right for this daughter of abraham who has been in the power of satan for eighteen years to be made free on the sabbath
 and when he said these things those who were against him were shamed and all the people were full of joy because of the great things which were done by him
 then he said what is the kingdom of god like what comparison may i make of it
 it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden and it became a tree and the birds of heaven made their resting places in its branches
 and again he said what is the kingdom of god like
 it is like leaven which a woman put into three measures of meal and it was all leavened
 and he went on his way through towns and country places teaching and journeying to jerusalem
 and someone said to him lord will only a small number have salvation and he said to them
 do your best to go in by the narrow door for i say to you a number will make the attempt to go in but will not be able to do so
 when the master of the house has got up and the door has been shut and you still outside give blows on the door saying lord let us in he will make answer and say i have no knowledge of where you come from
 then you will say we have taken food and drink with you and you were teaching in our streets
 but he will say truly i have no knowledge of you or where you come from go away from me you workers of evil
 there will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see abraham isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god but you yourselves are shut outside
 and they will come from the east and from the west from the north and from the south and take their places in the kingdom of god
 and the last will be first and the first will be last
 at that time certain pharisees came to him and said go away from this place because herods purpose is to put you to death
 and he said go and say to that fox i send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow and on the third day my work will be complete
 but i have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside jerusalem
 o jerusalem jerusalem putting to death the prophets and stoning those who were sent to her  again and again would i have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings but you would not 
 now see your house is waste and i say to you you will not see me again till you say a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord
 and it came about that when he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees on the sabbath to have a meal they were watching him
 and a certain man was there who had a disease
 and jesus answering said to the scribes and pharisees is it right to make people well on the sabbath or not
 but they said nothing and he made him well and sent him away
 and he said to them which of you whose ox or ass has got into a water hole will not straight away get him out on the sabbath
 and they had no answer to that question
 and he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast when he saw how they took the best seats saying to them
 when you get a request to come to a feast do not take the best seat for a more important man than you may be coming
 and then the giver of the feast will come to you and say give your place to this man and you with shame will have to take the lowest seat
 but when you come go and take the lowest seat so that when the giver of the feast comes he may say to you friend come up higher and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there
 for every man who gives himself a high place will be put down but he who takes a low place will be lifted up
 and he said to the master of the house when you give a feast do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth for they may give a feast for you and so you will get a reward
 but when you give a feast send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body
 and you will have a blessing because they will not be able to give you any payment and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead
 and hearing these words one of those who were at table with him said to him happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of god
 and he said to them a certain man gave a great feast and sent word of it to a number of people
 and when the time had come he sent his servants to say to them come for all things are now ready
 and they all gave reasons why they were not able to come the first said to him i have got a new field and it is necessary for me to go and see it i am full of regret that i am unable to come
 and another said i have got some cattle and i am going to make a test of them i am full of regret that i am unable to come
 and another said i have been married and so i am not able to come
 and the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor the blind and those who are broken in body
 and the servant said lord your orders have been done and still there is room
 and the lord said to the servant go out into the roads and the fields and make them come in so that my house may be full
 for i say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast
 now a great number of people went with him
 and turning round he said to them if any man comes to me and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters and even for his life he may not be my disciple
 whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple
 for which of you desiring to put up a tower does not first give much thought to the price if he will have enough to make it complete
 for fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end all who see it will be laughing at him
 and saying this man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete
 or what king going to war with another king will not first take thought if he will be strong enough with ten thousand men to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand
 or while the other is still a great distance away he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace
 and so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple
 for salt is good but if the taste goes from it of what use is it
 it is no good for the land or for the place of waste no one has a use for it he who has ears let him give ear
 now all the tax farmers and sinners came near to give ear to him
 and the pharisees and scribes were angry saying this man gives approval to sinners and takes food with them
 and he made a story for them saying
 what man of you having a hundred sheep if one of them gets loose and goes away will not let the ninety nine be in the waste land by themselves and go after the wandering one till he sees where it is
 and when he has got it again he takes it in his arms with joy
 and when he gets back to his house he sends for his neighbours and friends saying to them be glad with me for i have got back my sheep which had gone away
 i say to you that even so there will be more joy in heaven when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing than for ninety nine good men who have no need of a change of heart
 or what woman having ten bits of silver if one bit has gone from her hands will not get a light and go through her house searching with care till she sees it
 and when she has it again she gets her friends and neighbours together saying be glad with me for i have got back the bit of silver which had gone from me
 even so i say to you there is joy among the angels of god when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing
 and he said a certain man had two sons
 and the younger of them said to his father father give me that part of your property which will be mine and he made division of his goods between them
 and not long after the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far away country and there all his money went in foolish living
 and when everything was gone there was no food to be had in that country and he was in need
 and he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food
 and so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs food and no one gave him anything
 but when he came to his senses he said what numbers of my fathers servants have bread enough and more while i am near to death here through need of food 
 i will get up and go to my father and will say to him father i have done wrong against heaven and in your eyes
 i am no longer good enough to be named your son make me like one of your servants
 and he got up and went to his father but while he was still far away his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss
 and his son said to him father i have done wrong against heaven and in your eyes i am no longer good enough to be named your son
 but the father said to his servants get out the first robe quickly and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
 and get the fat young ox and put it to death and let us have a feast and be glad
 for this my son who was dead is living again he had gone away from me and has come back and they were full of joy
 now the older son was in the field and when he came near the house the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears
 and he sent for one of the servants questioning him about what it might be
 and he said to him your brother has come and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely
 but he was angry and would not go in and his father came out and made a request to him to come in
 but he made answer and said to his father see all these years i have been your servant doing your orders in everything and you never gave me even a young goat so that i might have a feast with my friends
 but when this your son came who has been wasting your property with bad women you put to death the fat young ox for him
 and he said to him son you are with me at all times and all i have is yours
 but it was right to be glad and to have a feast for this your brother who was dead is living again he had gone away and has come back
 and another time he said to the disciples there was a certain man of great wealth who had a servant and it was said to him that this servant was wasting his goods
 and he sent for him and said what is this which is said about you give me an account of all you have done for you will no longer be the manager of my property
 and the servant said to himself what am i to do now that my lord takes away my position i have not enough strength for working in the fields and i would be shamed if i made requests for money from people in the streets
 i have come to a decision what to do so that when i am put out of my position they will take me into their houses
 and sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first what is the amount of your debt to my lord
 and he said a hundred measures of oil and he said take your account straight away and put down fifty
 then he said to another what is the amount of your debt and he said a hundred measures of grain and he said to him take your account and put down eighty
 and his lord was pleased with the false servant because he had been wise for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light
 and i say to you make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life so that when it comes to an end you may be taken into the eternal resting places
 he who is true in a little is true in much he who is false in small things is false in great
 if then you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life who will give into your care the true wealth
 and if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people who will give you that which is yours
 no man may be a servant to two masters for he will have hate for the one and love for the other or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other you may not be servants of god and of wealth
 and the pharisees who had a great love of money hearing these things were making sport of him
 and he said you take care to seem right in the eyes of men but god sees your hearts and those things which are important in the opinion of men are evil in the eyes of god
 the law and the prophets were till john but then came the preaching of the kingdom of god and everyone makes his way into it by force
 but heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out
 everyone who puts away his wife and takes another is a false husband and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away is no true husband to her
 now there was a certain man of great wealth who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen and was shining and glad every day
 and a certain poor man named lazarus was stretched out at his door full of wounds
 desiring the broken bits of food which came from the table of the man of wealth and even the dogs came and put their tongues on his wounds
 and in time the poor man came to his end and angels took him to abrahams breast and the man of wealth came to his end and was put in the earth
 and in hell being in great pain lifting up his eyes he saw abraham far away and lazarus on his breast
 and he gave a cry and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue for i am cruelly burning in this flame
 but abraham said keep in mind my son that when you were living you had your good things while lazarus had evil things but now he is comforted and you are in pain
 and in addition there is a deep division fixed between us and you so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so and no one may come from you to us
 and he said father it is my request that you will send him to my fathers house
 for i have five brothers and let him give them an account of these things so that they may not come to this place of pain
 but abraham said they have moses and the prophets let them give ear to what they say
 and he said no father abraham but if someone went to them from the dead their hearts would be changed
 and he said to him if they will not give attention to moses and the prophets they will not be moved even if someone comes back from the dead
 and he said to his disciples it is necessary for causes of trouble to come about but unhappy is he by whom they come
 it would be well for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea before he made trouble for any of these little ones
 give attention to yourselves if your brother does wrong say a sharp word to him and if he has sorrow for his sin let him have forgiveness
 and if he does you wrong seven times in a day and seven times comes to you and says i have regret for what i have done let him have forgiveness
 and the twelve said to the lord make our faith greater
 and the lord said if your faith was only as great as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this tree be rooted up and planted in the sea and it would be done
 but which of you having a servant who is ploughing or keeping sheep will say to him when he comes in from the field come now and be seated and have a meal
 will he not say get a meal for me and make yourself ready and see to my needs till i have had my food and drink and after that you may have yours
 does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered
 in the same way when you have done all the things which are given you to do say there is no profit in us for we have only done what we were ordered to do
 and it came about that when they were on the way to jerusalem he went through samaria and galilee
 and when he went into a certain small town he came across ten men who were lepers and they keeping themselves at a distance
 said in loud voices jesus master have mercy on us
 and when he saw them he said go and let the priests see you and while they were going they were made clean
 and one of them when he saw that he was clean turning back gave praise to god in a loud voice
 and falling down on his face at the feet of jesus he gave the credit to him and he was a man of samaria
 and jesus said were there not ten men who were made clean where are the nine
 have not any of them come back to give glory to god but only this one from a strange land
 and he said to him get up and go on your way your faith has made you well
 and when the pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of god would come he gave them an answer and said the kingdom of god will not come through observation
 and men will not say see it is here  or there  for the kingdom of god is among you
 and he said to his disciples the time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the son of man but you will not see it
 and if they say to you see it is there  or it is here  do not go away or go after them
 for as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other so will the son of man be when his time comes
 but first he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation
 and as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the day of the son of man
 they were feasting and taking wives and getting married till the day of the overflowing of the waters when noah went into the ark and they all came to destruction
 in the same way in the days of lot they were feasting and trading they were planting and building
 but on the day when lot went out of sodom fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all
 so will it be in the day of the revelation of the son of man
 on that day if anyone is on the roof of the house and his goods are in the house let him not go down to take them away and let him who is in the field not go back to his house
 keep in mind lots wife
 if anyone makes an attempt to keep his life it will be taken from him but if anyone gives up his life he will keep it
 i say to you in that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed and one will be taken away and the other let go
 two women will be crushing grain together one will be taken away and the other let go
   
 and they answering him said where lord and he said to them where the body is there will the eagles come together
 and he made a story for them the point of which was that men were to go on making prayer and not get tired
 saying there was a judge in a certain town who had no fear of god or respect for man
 and there was a widow in that town and she kept on coming to him and saying give me my right against the man who has done me wrong
 and for a time he would not but later he said to himself though i have no fear of god or respect for man
 because this widow is a trouble to me i will give her her right for if not i will be completely tired out by her frequent coming
 and the lord said give ear to the words of the evil judge
 and will not god do right in the cause of his saints whose cries come day and night to his ears though he is long in doing it
 i say to you that he will quickly do right in their cause but when the son of man comes will there be any faith on earth
 and he made this story for some people who were certain that they were good and had a low opinion of others
 two men went up to the temple for prayer one a pharisee and the other a tax farmer
 the pharisee taking up his position said to himself these words god i give you praise because i am not like other men who take more than their right who are evil doers who are untrue to their wives or even like this tax farmer
 twice in the week i go without food i give a tenth of all i have
 the tax farmer on the other hand keeping far away and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven made signs of grief and said god have mercy on me a sinner
 i say to you this man went back to his house with gods approval and not the other for everyone who makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high
 and they took their children to him so that he might put his hands on them but when the disciples saw it they said sharp words to them
 but jesus sent for them saying let the children come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of heaven
 truly i say to you whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of god like a little child will not come into it at all
 and a certain ruler put a question to him saying good master what have i to do so that i may have eternal life
 and jesus said to him why do you say that i am good no one is good but only god
 you have knowledge of what the law says do not be untrue to your wife do not put anyone to death do not take what is not yours do not give false witness give honour to your father and mother
 and he said all these things i have done from the time when i was a boy
 and jesus hearing it said to him one thing you still have need of get money for your goods and give it away to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come after me
 but at these words he became very sad for he had great wealth
 and jesus looking at him said how hard it is for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of god 
 it is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of god
 and those who were present said then who may have salvation
 but he said things which are not possible with man are possible with god
 and peter said see we have given up what is ours to come after you
 and he said to them truly i say to you there is no man who has given up house or wife or brothers or father or mother or children because of the kingdom of god
 who will not get much more in this time and in the world to come eternal life
 and he took with him the twelve and said to them now we are going up to jerusalem and all the things which were said by the prophets will be done to the son of man
 for he will be given up to the gentiles and will be made sport of and put to shame
 and he will be given cruel blows and put to death and on the third day he will come back to life
 but they did not take in the sense of any of these words and what he said was not clear to them and their minds were not able to see it
 and it came about that when he got near jericho a certain blind man was seated by the side of the road making requests for money from those who went by
 and hearing the sound of a great number of people going by he said what is this
 and they said to him jesus of nazareth is going by
 and he said in a loud voice jesus son of david have mercy on me
 and those who were in front made protests and said to him be quiet but he said all the more o son of david have mercy on me
 and jesus stopping gave orders that he was to come to him and when he came near he said to him
 what would you have me do for you and he said lord that i may be able to see again
 and jesus said see again your faith has made you well
 and straight away he was able to see and he went after him giving glory to god and all the people when they saw it gave praise to god
 and he went into jericho and when he was going through it
 a man named zacchaeus who was the chief tax farmer and a man of wealth
 made an attempt to get a view of jesus and was not able to do so because of the people for he was a small man
 and he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him for he was going that way
 and when jesus came to the place looking up he said to him zacchaeus be quick and come down for i am coming to your house today
 and he came down quickly and took him into his house with joy
 and when they saw it they were all angry saying he has gone into the house of a sinner
 and zacchaeus waiting before him said to the lord see lord half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken anything from anyone wrongly i give him back four times as much
 and jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house for even he is a son of abraham
 for the son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way and to be their saviour
 and while they were giving ear to these words he made another story for them because he was near jerusalem and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of god was coming straight away
 so he said a certain man of high birth went into a far away country to get a kingdom for himself and to come back
 and he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them do business with this till i come
 but his people had no love for him and sent representatives after him saying we will not have this man for our ruler
 and when he came back again having got his kingdom he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him so that he might have an account of what business they had done
 and the first came before him saying lord your pound has made ten pounds
 and he said to him you have done well o good servant because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns
 and another came saying your pound has made five pounds
 and he said you will be ruler over five towns
 and another came saying lord here is your pound which i put away in a cloth
 because i was in fear of you for you are a hard man you take up what you have not put down and get in grain where you have not put seed
 he said to him by the words of your mouth you will be judged you bad servant you had knowledge that i am a hard man taking up what i have not put down and getting in grain where i have not put seed
 why then did you not put my money in a bank so that when i came i would get it back with interest
 and he said to the others who were near take the pound away from him and give it to the man who has ten
 and they say to him lord he has ten pounds
 and i say to you that to everyone who has more will be given but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
 and as for those who were against me who would not have me for their ruler let them come here and be put to death before me
 and when he had said this he went on in front of them going up to jerusalem
 and it came about that when he got near beth phage and bethany by the mountain which is named the mountain of olives he sent two of the disciples
 saying go into the little town in front of you and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord on which no man has ever been seated let him loose and take him
 and if anyone says to you why are you taking him say the lord has need of him
 and those whom he sent went away and it was as he said
 and when they were getting the young ass the owners of it said to them why are you taking the young ass
 and they said the lord has need of him
 and they took him to jesus and they put their clothing on the ass and jesus got on to him
 and while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him
 and when he came near the foot of the mountain of olives all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to god with joy because of all the great works which they had seen
 saying a blessing on the king who comes in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest
 and some of the pharisees among the people said to him master make your disciples be quiet
 and he said in answer i say to you if these men keep quiet the very stones will be crying out
 and when he got near and saw the town he was overcome with weeping for it
 saying if you even you had knowledge today of the things which give peace  but you are not able to see them
 for the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you and come all round you and keep you in on every side
 and will make you level with the earth and your children with you and there will not be one stone resting on another in you because you did not see that it was your day of mercy
 and he went into the temple and put out those who were trading there
 saying to them it has been said my house is to be a house of prayer but you have made it a hole of thieves
 and every day he was teaching in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death
 but they were not able to do anything because the people all kept near him being greatly interested in his words
 now it came about in those days that an order went out from caesar augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world
 this was the first numbering which was made when quirinius was ruler of syria
 and all men went to be numbered everyone to his town
 and joseph went up from galilee out of the town of nazareth into judaea to beth lehem the town of david because he was of the house and family of david
 to be put on the list with mary his future wife who was about to become a mother
 and while they were there the time came for her to give birth
 and she had her first son and folding him in linen she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food because there was no room for them in the house
 and in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields watching over their flock by night
 and an angel of the lord came to them and the glory of the lord was shining round about them and fear came on them
 and the angel said have no fear for truly i give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people
 for on this day in the town of david a saviour has come to birth who is christ the lord
 and this is the sign to you you will see a young child folded in linen in the place where the cattle have their food
 and suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven giving praise to god and saying
 glory to god in the highest and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased
 and when the angels had gone away from them into heaven the keepers of the sheep said to one another let us go now to beth lehem and see this thing which has come about which the lord has made clear to us
 and they came quickly and saw mary and joseph and the child in the place where the cattle had their food
 and when they saw it they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child
 and all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep
 but mary kept all these words in her heart and gave much thought to them
 then the keepers of the sheep went back giving glory and praise to god for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen as it had been said to them
 and when after eight days the time came for his circumcision he was named jesus the name which the angel had given to him before his birth
 and when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of moses had come to an end they took him to jerusalem to give him to the lord
  as it says in the law of the lord every mothers first male child is to be holy to the lord 
 and to make an offering as it is ordered in the law of the lord of two doves or other young birds
 and there was then in jerusalem a man whose name was simeon and he was an upright man fearing god and waiting for the comfort of israel and the holy spirit was on him
 and he had knowledge through the holy spirit that he would not see death till he had seen the lords christ
 and full of the spirit he came into the temple and when the father and mother came in with the child jesus to do with him what was ordered by the law
 then he took him in his arms and gave praise to god and said
 now you are letting your servant go in peace o lord as you have said
 for my eyes have seen your salvation
 which you have made ready before the face of all nations
 a light of revelation to the gentiles and the glory of your people israel
 and his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him
 and simeon gave them his blessing and said to mary his mother see this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in israel and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said
  and a sword will go through your heart  so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light
 and there was one anna a woman prophet the daughter of phanuel of the family of asher  she was very old and after seven years of married life
 she had been a widow for eighty four years  she was in the temple at all times worshipping with prayers and going without food night and day
 and coming up at that time she gave praise to god talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of jerusalem
 and when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the lord they went back to galilee to nazareth the town where they were living
 and the child became tall and strong and full of wisdom and the grace of god was on him
 and every year his father and mother went to jerusalem at the feast of the passover
 and when he was twelve years old they went up as their way was to the feast
 and when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back the boy jesus was still in jerusalem but they had no knowledge of it
 and in the belief that he was with some of their number they went a days journey and after looking for him among their relations and friends
 and seeing that he was not there they went back to jerusalem to make search for him
 and after three days they came across him in the temple seated among the wise men giving ear to their words and putting questions to them
 and all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave
 and when they saw him they were surprised and his mother said to him son why have you done this to us see your father and i have been looking for you with sorrow
 and he said to them why were you looking for me was it not clear to you that my right place was in my fathers house
 and his words seemed strange to them
 and he went down with them and came to nazareth and did as he was ordered and his mother kept all these words in her heart
 and jesus was increasing in wisdom and in years and in grace before god and men
 and it came about on one of those days when he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the good news
 that the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority
 and in answer he said to them i will put a question to you and do you give me an answer
 the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men
 and they said among themselves if we say from heaven he will say why did you not have faith in him
 but if we say of men we will be stoned by the people for they are certain that john was a prophet
 and they made answer that they had no idea where it came from
 and jesus said and i will not make clear to you by what authority i do these things
 and he gave the people this story a man made a vine garden and gave the use of it to some field workers and went into another country for a long time
 and at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing
 and he sent another servant and they gave blows to him in the same way and put shame on him and sent him away with nothing
 and he sent a third and they gave him wounds and put him out
 and the lord of the garden said what am i to do i will send my dearly loved son they may give respect to him
 but when the workmen saw him they said to one another this is he who will one day be the owner of the property let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours
 and driving him out of the garden they put him to death now what will the lord do to these workmen
 he will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others and when he said this they said may it not be so
 but he looking on them said is it not in the writings the stone which the builders put on one side the same has become the chief stone of the building
 everyone falling on that stone will be broken but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust
 and the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour and they were in fear of the people for they saw that he had made up this story against them
 and they kept watch on him and sent out secret representatives who were acting the part of good men in order that they might get something from his words on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler
 and they put a question to him saying master we are certain that your teaching and your words are right and that you have no respect for a mans position but you are teaching the true way of god
 is it right for us to make payment of taxes to caesar or not
 but he saw through their trick and said to them
 let me see a penny whose image and name are on it and they said caesars
 and he said then give to caesar the things which are caesars and to god the things which are gods
 and they were not able to get anything from these words before the people but they were full of wonder at his answer and said nothing
 and some of the sadducees came to him who say that there is no coming back from the dead and they said to him
 master moses said that if a mans brother comes to his end having a wife but no children his brother is to take the wife and get a family for his brother
 now there were seven brothers and the first had a wife and came to his end having no children
 and the second
 and the third took her and in the same way all the seven without having any children came to their end
 and last of all the woman came to her end
 when they come back from the dead whose wife will she be for all the seven had her
 and jesus said to them the sons of this world are married and have wives
 but those to whom is given the reward of the world to come and to come back from the dead have no wives and are not married
 and death has no more power over them for they are equal to the angels and are sons of god being of those who will come back from the dead
 but even moses made it clear that the dead come back to life saying in the story of the burning thorn tree the lord the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
 now he is not the god of the dead but of the living for all men are living to him
 and some of the scribes in answer to this said master you have said well
 and they had fear of putting any more questions to him
 and he said to them why do they say that the christ is the son of david
 for david himself says in the book of psalms the lord said to my lord take your seat at my right hand
 till i put under your feet all those who are against you
 david then gives him the name of lord so how is it possible for him to be his son
 and in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples
 keep away from the scribes whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and to have words of respect said to them in the market places and to take the chief seats in the synagogues and the first places at feasts
 who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers they will get a greater punishment
 and looking up he saw the men of wealth putting their offerings in the money box
 and he saw a certain poor widow putting in a farthing
 and he said truly i say to you this poor widow has given more than all of them
 for they gave out of their wealth having more than enough for themselves but she even out of her need has put in all her living
 and some were talking about the temple how it was made fair with beautiful stones and with offerings but he said
 as for these things which you see the days will come when not one stone will be resting on another but all will be broken down
 and they said to him master when will these things be and what sign will there be when these events are to take place
 and he said take care that you are not tricked for a number of people will come in my name saying i am he and the time is near do not go after them
 and when news of wars and troubled times comes to your ears have no fear for these things have to be but the end will not be now
 then he said to them nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom
 there will be great earth shocks and outbursts of disease in a number of places and men will be without food and there will be wonders and great signs from heaven
 but before all this they will take you and be very cruel to you giving you up to the synagogues and to prisons taking you before kings and rulers because of my name
 and it will be turned to a witness for you
 so take care not to be troubled before the time comes about what answers you will give
 for i will give you words and wisdom so that not one of those who are against you will be able to get the better of you or to put you in the wrong
 but you will be given up even by your fathers and mothers your brothers and relations and friends and some of you will be put to death
 and you will be hated by all men because of me
 but not a hair of your head will come to destruction
 by going through all these things you will keep your lives
 but when you see armies all round about jerusalem then be certain that her destruction is near
 then let those who are in judaea go in flight to the mountains and those who are in the middle of the town go out and let not those who are in the country come in
 for these are the days of punishment in which all the things in the writings will be put into effect
 it will be hard for women who are with child and for her with a baby at the breast in those days for great trouble will come on the land and wrath on this people
 and they will be put to death with the sword and will be taken as prisoners into all the nations and jerusalem will be crushed under the feet of the gentiles till the times of the gentiles are complete
 and there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars and on the earth fear among the nations and doubt because of the loud noise of the sea and the waves
 mens strength will go from them in fear and in waiting for the things which are coming on the earth for the powers of the heavens will be moved
 and then they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory
 but when these things come about let your heads be lifted up because your salvation is near
 and he made a story for them see the fig tree and all the trees
 when they put out their young leaves you take note of it and it is clear to you that summer is coming
 in the same way when you see these things taking place you may be certain that the kingdom of god is near
 truly i say to you this generation will not come to an end till all things are complete
 heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
 but give attention to yourselves for fear that your hearts become over full of the pleasures of food and wine and the cares of this life and that day may come on you suddenly and take you as in a net
 for so it will come on all those who are living on the face of all the earth
 but keep watch at all times with prayer that you may be strong enough to come through all these things and take your place before the son of man
 and every day he was teaching in the temple and every night he went out to the mountain which is named the mountain of olives to take his rest
 and all the people came early in the morning to give ear to his words in the temple
 now the feast of unleavened bread was near which is called the passover
 and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a chance to put him to death but they went in fear of the people
 and satan came into judas iscariot who was one of the twelve
 and he went away and had a discussion with the chief priests and the rulers about how he might give him up to them
 and they were glad and undertook to give him money
 and he made an agreement with them to give him up to them if he got a chance when the people were not present
 and the day of unleavened bread came when the passover lamb is put to death
 and jesus sent peter and john saying go and make the passover ready for us so that we may take it
 and they said to him where are we to get it ready
 and he said to them when you go into the town you will see a man coming to you with a vessel of water go after him into the house into which he goes
 and say to the master of the house the master says where is the guest room where i may take the passover with my disciples
 and he will take you up to a great room with a table and seats there make ready
 and they went and it was as he had said and they made the passover ready
 and when the time had come he took his seat and the apostles with him
 and he said i have had a great desire to keep this passover with you before i come to my death
 for i say to you i will not take it till it is made complete in the kingdom of god
 and he took a cup and having given praise he said make division of this among yourselves
 for i say to you i will not take of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of god has come
 and he took bread and having given praise he gave it to them when it had been broken saying this is my body which is given for you do this in memory of me
 and in the same way after the meal he took the cup saying this cup is the new testament made with my blood which is given for you
 but the hand of him who is false to me is with me at the table
 for it will be done to the son of man after the purpose of god but unhappy is that man by whom he is given up
 and they were wondering among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing
 and there was an argument among them about which of them was the greatest
 and he said the kings of the gentiles are lords over them and those who have authority are given names of honour
 but let it not be so with you but he who is greater let him become like the younger and he who is chief like a servant
 for which is greater the guest who is seated at a meal or the servant who is waiting on him is it not the guest but i am among you as a servant
 but you are those who have kept with me through my troubles
 and i will give you a kingdom as my father has given one to me
 so that you may take food and drink at my table in my kingdom and be seated like kings judging the twelve tribes of israel
 simon simon satan has made a request to have you so that he may put you to the test as grain is tested
 but i have made prayer for you that your faith may not go from you and when you are turned again make your brothers strong
 and he said to him lord i am ready to go with you to prison and to death
 and he said i say to you peter before the cocks second cry today you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
 and he said to them when i sent you out without money or bag or shoes were you in need of anything and they said nothing
 and he said to them but now he who has a money bag or a bag for food let him take it and he who has not let him give his coat for money and get a sword
 for i say to you that these words will be put into effect in me and he was numbered among the evil doers for what has been said in the writings about me has an end
 and they said lord here are two swords and he said it is enough
 and he came out and went as his way was to the mountain of olives and the disciples went with him
 and when he came to the place he said to them make a prayer that you may not be put to the test
 and he went a little distance away from them and falling on his knees in prayer he said
 father if it is your pleasure take this cup from me but still let your pleasure not mine be done
 and an angel from heaven came to him to give him strength
 and being in great trouble of soul the force of his prayer became stronger and great drops like blood came from him falling to the earth
 and getting up from prayer he came to the disciples and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow
 and he said why are you sleeping get up and give yourselves to prayer so that you may not be put to the test
 and while he was saying these words there came a band of people and judas one of the twelve was in front of them and he came near to jesus to give him a kiss
 but jesus said to him judas will you be false to the son of man with a kiss
 and when those who were with him saw what was coming they said lord may we not make use of our swords
 and one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest cutting off his right ear
 but jesus answering said put up with this at least and touching his ear he made it well
 and jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the temple and the rulers who had come against him have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks
 when i was in the temple with you every day your hands were not stretched out against me but this is your hour and the authority of the dark power
 and they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest but peter went after them at a distance
 and a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square and they were seated together and peter was among them
 and a certain woman servant seeing him in the light of the fire and looking at him with attention said this man was with him
 but he said woman it is not true i have no knowledge of him
 and after a little time another saw him and said you are one of them and he said man i am not
 and after about an hour another man said with decision certainly this man was with him for he is a galilaean
 and peter said man i have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking and straight away while he was saying these words there came the cry of a cock
 and the lord turning gave peter a look and the words of the lord came to peters mind how he had said this night before the hour of the cocks cry you will be false to me three times
 and he went out weeping bitterly
 and the men in whose hands jesus was made sport of him and gave him blows
 and covering his eyes they said to him are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow
 and they said a number of other evil things against him
 and when it was day the rulers of the people came together with the chief priests and the scribes and they took him before their sanhedrin saying
 if you are the christ say so but he said if i say so you will not have belief
 and if i put a question to you you will not give an answer
 but in the future the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of god
 and they all said are you then the son of god and he said you say that i am
 and they said what more need have we of witness we have the very words of his mouth
 and they all went and took him before pilate
 and they made statements against him saying this man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong and not to make payment of taxes to caesar even saying that he himself is christ a king
 and pilate said to him are you the king of the jews and he said in answer you say so
 and pilate said to the chief priests and the people in my opinion this man has done no wrong
 but they became more violent than before saying he has made trouble among the people teaching through all judaea from galilee to this place
 but at these words pilate said is the man a galilaean
 and when he saw that he was under the authority of herod he sent him to herod who was in jerusalem himself at that time
 now when herod saw jesus he was very glad having for a long time had a desire to see him for he had had accounts of him and was hoping to see some wonders done by him
 and he put a great number of questions to him but he said nothing
 and the chief priests and the scribes were there making statements against him violently
 and herod with the men of his army put shame on him and made sport of him and dressing him in shining robes he sent him back to pilate
 and that day herod and pilate became friends with one another for before they had been against one another
 and pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people and said to them
 you say that this man has been teaching the people evil things now i after going into the question before you see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him
 and herod is of the same opinion for he has sent him back to us for you see he has done nothing for which i might put him to death
 and so i will give him punishment and let him go
   
 but with loud voices they said all together put this man to death and make barabbas free
 now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town in which there had been loss of life
 and pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let jesus go free
 but crying out they said to the cross with him 
 and he said to them a third time why what evil has he done i see no reason for putting him to death i will give him punishment and let him go
 but they went on crying out loudly let him be put to death on the cross and they had their way
 and pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect
 and in answer to their request he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death and jesus he gave up to their pleasure
 and while they were taking him away they put their hands on simon of cyrene who was coming from the country and made him take the cross after jesus
 and a great band of people went after him and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him
 but jesus turning to them said daughters of jerusalem let not your weeping be for me but for yourselves and for your children
 for the days are coming in which they will say happy are those who have had no children whose bodies have never given birth whose breasts have never given milk
 and they will say to the mountains come down on us and to the hills be a cover over us
 for if they do these things when the tree is green what will they do when it is dry
 and two others evil doers were taken with him to be put to death
 and when they came to the place which is named golgotha they put him on the cross and the evil doers one on the right side and the other on the left
 and jesus said father let them have forgiveness for they have no knowledge of what they are doing and they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance
 and the people were looking on and the rulers made sport of him saying he was a saviour of others let him do something for himself if he is the christ the man of gods selection
 and the men of the army made sport of him coming to him and giving him bitter wine
 and saying if you are the king of the jews get yourself free
 and these words were put in writing over him this is the king of the jews
 and one of the evil doers on the cross with bitter feeling said to him are you not the christ get yourself and us out of this
 but the other protesting said have you no fear of god for you have a part in the same punishment
 and with reason for we have the right reward of our acts but this man has done nothing wrong
 and he said jesus keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom
 and he said to him truly i say to you today you will be with me in paradise
 and it was now about the sixth hour and all the land was dark till the ninth hour
 the light of the sun went out and the curtain in the temple was parted in two
 and jesus gave a loud cry and said father into your hands i give my spirit and when he had said this he gave up his spirit
 and when the captain saw what was done he gave praise to god saying without doubt this was an upright man
 and all the people who had come together to see it when they saw the things which were done went back again making signs of grief
 and all his friends and the women who came with him from galilee were waiting at a distance watching these things
 now there was a man named joseph a man of authority and a good and upright man
  he had not given his approval to their decision or their acts  of arimathaea a town of the jews who was waiting for the kingdom of god
 this man went to pilate and made a request for the body of jesus
 and he took it down and folding it in a linen cloth he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body and no one had ever been put in it
 now it was the day of making ready and the sabbath was coming on
 and the women who had come with him from galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest
 and they went back and got ready spices and perfumes and on the sabbath they took their rest in agreement with the law
 but on the first day of the week at dawn they came to the place where his body had been put taking the spices which they had got ready
 and they saw that the stone had been rolled away
 and they went in but the body of the lord jesus was not there
 and while they were in doubt about it they saw two men in shining clothing by them
 and while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear these said to them why are you looking for the living among the dead
 he is not here he has come back to life have in mind what he said to you when he was still in galilee saying
 the son of man will be given up into the hands of evil doers and be put to death on the cross and on the third day he will come back to life
 and his words came back into their minds
 and they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others
 now they were mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and the other women with them said these things to the apostles
 but these words seemed foolish to them and they had no belief in them
 but peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place
 and then two of them on that very day were going to a little town named emmaus which was about seven miles from jerusalem
 and they were talking together about all those things which had taken place
 and while they were talking and questioning together jesus himself came near and went with them
 but their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him
 and he said to them what are you talking about together while you go
 then stopping and looking sadly at him one of them named cleopas said to him are you the only man living in jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time
 and he said to them what things and they said the things to do with jesus of nazareth who was a prophet great in his acts and his words before god and all the people
 and how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross
 but we were hoping that he would be the saviour of israel in addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place
 and certain women among us gave us cause for wonder for they went early to the place where his body had been put
 and it was not there then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living
 and some of those who were with us went to the place and saw that it was as the women had said but him they did not see
 and he said o foolish men  how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said
 was it not necessary for the christ to go through these things and to come into his glory
 and he made clear to them all the things in the writings from moses and from all the prophets which had to do with himself
 and they came near the town to which they were going and he seemed as if he was going on
 but they kept him back saying do not go for evening is near the day is almost gone and he went in with them
 and when he was seated with them at table he took the bread and said words of blessing and making division of it he gave it to them
 and then their eyes were open and they had knowledge of him but he went from their view
 and they said to one another were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way making clear to us the holy writings
 and that very hour they got up and went back to jerusalem where the eleven and the others had come together
 and they said to them the lord has truly come back to life again and simon has seen him
 and they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way and how when he gave them bread they had knowledge of him
 and while they were saying these things he himself was among them and said to them peace be with you 
 but they were full of fear being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit
 and he said to them why are you troubled and why are your hearts full of doubt
 see my hands and my feet it is i myself put your hands on me and make certain for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that i have
 and when he had said this he let them see his hands and his feet
 and because for joy and wonder they were still in doubt he said to them have you any food here
 and they gave him a bit of cooked fish
 and before their eyes he took a meal
 and he said to them these are the words which i said to you when i was still with you how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of moses and the prophets and in the psalms about me to be put into effect
 then he made the holy writings clear to their minds
 and he said to them so it is in the writings that the christ would undergo death and come back to life again on the third day
 and that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to jerusalem first and to all nations in his name
 you are witnesses of these things
 and now i will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you but do not go from the town till the power from heaven comes to you
 and he took them out till they were near bethany and lifting up his hands he gave them a blessing
 and while he was doing so he went from them and was taken up into heaven
 and they gave him worship and went back to jerusalem with great joy
 and they were in the temple at all times giving praise to god
 now in the fifteenth year of the rule of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being ruler of judaea and herod being king of galilee his brother philip king of the country of ituraea and trachonitis and lysanias king of abilene
 when annas and caiaphas were high priests the word of the lord came to john the son of zacharias in the waste land
 and he came into all the country round about jordan preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed
 as it says in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet the voice of one crying in the waste land make ready the way of the lord make his roads straight
 every valley will be lifted up and all the mountains and hills made low and the twisted will be made straight and the rough ways smooth
 and all flesh will see the salvation of god
 so he said to the people who went out to him for baptism you offspring of snakes at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come
 make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed and do not say to yourselves we have abraham for our father for i say to you that god is able from these stones to make children of abraham
 and even now the axe is put to the root of the trees and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire
 and the people put questions to him saying what have we to do
 and he made answer and said to them he who has two coats let him give to him who has not even one and he who has food let him do the same
 then tax farmers came to him for baptism and said to him master what have we to do
 and he said to them do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount
 and men of the army put questions to him saying and what have we to do and he said to them do no violent acts to any man and do not take anything without right and let your payment be enough for you
 and while the people were waiting and all men were questioning in their hearts about john if he was the christ or not
 john made answer saying to them all truly i give you baptism with water but one is coming who is greater than i whose shoes i am not good enough to undo he will give you baptism with the holy spirit and with fire
 in whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain he will put the good grain in his store but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out
 and so comforting them with these and other words he gave the good news to the people
 but herod the king because john had made a protest on account of herodias his brothers wife and other evil things which herod had done
 did this most evil thing of all and had john shut up in prison
 now it came about that when all the people had been given baptism jesus having had baptism with them was in prayer when the heaven being open
 the holy spirit came down in the form of a dove and a voice came from heaven saying you are my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 and jesus at this time was about thirty years old being the son  as it seemed  of joseph the son of heli
 the son of matthat the son of levi the son of melchi the son of jannai the son of joseph
 the son of mattathias the son of amos the son of nahum the son of esli the son of naggai
 the son of maath the son of mattathias the son of semein the son of josech the son of joda
 the son of joanan the son of rhesa the son of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel the son of neri
 the son of melchi the son of addi the son of cosam the son of elmadam the son of er
 the son of jesus the son of eliezer the son of jorim the son of matthat the son of levi
 the son of symeon the son of judas the son of joseph the son of jonam the son of eliakim
 the son of melea the son of menna the son of mattatha the son of nathan the son of david
 the son of jesse the son of obed the son of boaz the son of salmon the son of nahshon
 the son of amminadab the son of arni the son of hezron the son of perez the son of judah
 the son of jacob the son of isaac the son of abraham the son of terah the son of nahor
 the son of serug the son of reu the son of peleg the son of eber the son of shelah
 the son of cainan the son of arphaxad the son of shem the son of noah the son of lamech
 the son of methuselah the son of enoch the son of jared the son of mahalaleel the son of cainan
 the son of enos the son of seth the son of adam the son of god
 and jesus full of the holy spirit came back from the jordan and was guided by the spirit in the waste land
 for forty days being tested by the evil one and he had no food in those days and when they came to an end he was in need of food
 and the evil one said to him if you are the son of god give orders to this stone to become bread
 and jesus made answer to him it has been said in the writings bread is not mans only need
 and he took him up and let him see all the kingdoms of the earth in a minute of time
 and the evil one said i will give you authority over all these and the glory of them for it has been given to me and i give it to anyone at my pleasure
 if then you will give worship to me it will all be yours
 and jesus in answer said to him it has been said in the writings give worship to the lord your god and be his servant only
 and he took him to jerusalem and put him on the highest point of the temple and said to him if you are the son of god let yourself go down from here for it is said in the writings
 he will give his angels orders to take care of you
 and in their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
 and jesus made answer and said to him it is said in the writings you may not put the lord your god to the test
 and when all these tests were ended the evil one went away from him for a time
 and jesus came back to galilee in the power of the spirit and the news of him went through all the country round about
 and he was teaching in their synagogues and all men gave him praise
 and he came to nazareth where he had been as a child and he went as his way was into the synagogue on the sabbath and got up to give a reading
 and the book of the prophet isaiah was given to him and opening the book he came on the place where it is said
 the spirit of the lord is on me because i am marked out by him to give good news to the poor he has sent me to make well those who are broken hearted to say that the prisoners will be let go and the blind will see and to make the wounded free from their chains
 to give knowledge that the year of the lords good pleasure is come
 and shutting the book he gave it back to the servant and took his seat and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him
 then he said to them today this word has come true in your hearing
 and they were all giving witness with wonder to the words of grace which came from his mouth and they said is not this the son of joseph
 and he said to them without doubt you will say to me let the medical man make himself well the things which to our knowledge were done at capernaum do them here in your country
 and he said to them truly i say to you no prophet is honoured in his country
 truly i say to you there were a number of widows in israel in the days of elijah when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months and there was no food in the land
 but elijah was not sent to one of them but only to zarephath in the land of sidon to a woman who was a widow
 and there were a number of lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet and not one of them was made clean but only naaman the syrian
 and all who were in the synagogue were very angry when these things were said to them
 and they got up and took him out of the town to the edge of the mountain on which their town was so that they might send him down to his death
 but he came through them and went on his way
 and he came down to capernaum a town of galilee and he was giving them teaching on the sabbath
 and they were surprised at his teaching for his word was with authority
 and there was a man in the synagogue who had an unclean spirit and he gave a loud cry and said
 let us be  what have we to do with you jesus of nazareth have you come to put an end to us i have knowledge who you are the holy one of god
 and jesus said to him be quiet and come out of him and when the evil spirit had put him down on the earth in the middle of them he came out of him having done him no damage
 and wonder came on them all and they said to one another what are these words for with authority and power he gives orders to the evil spirits and they come out
 and there was much talk about him in all the places round about
 and he got up and went out of the synagogue and went into the house of simon and simons wifes mother was very ill with a burning heat and in answer to their prayers for her
 he went near her and with a sharp word he gave orders to the disease and it went away from her and straight away she got up and took care of their needs
 and at sundown all those who had anyone ill with any sort of disease took them to him and he put his hands on every one of them and made them well
 and evil spirits came out of a number of them crying out and saying you are the son of god but he gave them sharp orders not to say a word because they had knowledge that he was the christ
 and when it was day he came out and went to a waste place and great numbers of people came looking for him and they came to him and would have kept him from going away
 but he said to them i have to give the good news of the kingdom of god in other towns because that is why i was sent
 and he was teaching in the synagogues of galilee
 now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him and to have knowledge of the word of god he was by a wide stretch of water named gennesaret
 and he saw two boats by the edge of the water but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets
 and he got into one of the boats the property of simon and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land and being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat
 and when his talk was ended he said to simon go out into deep water and let down your nets for fish
 and simon answering said master we were working all night and we took nothing but at your word i will let down the nets
 and when they had done this they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken
 and they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help and they came and the two boats were so full that they were going down
 but simon when he saw it went down at the knees of jesus and said go away from me o lord for i am a sinner
 for he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him at the number of fish which they had taken
 and so were james and john the sons of zebedee who were working with simon and jesus said to simon have no fear from this time forward you will be a fisher of men
 and when they had got their boats to the land they gave up everything and went after him
 and it came about that while he was in one of the towns there was a leper there and when he saw jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him saying lord if it is your pleasure you have power to make me clean
 and he put out his hand to him and said it is my pleasure be clean and straight away his disease went from him
 and he gave him orders say nothing to any man but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean as the law of moses says and for a witness to them
 but news of him went out all the more in every direction and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases
 but he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer
 and it came about that on one of these days he was teaching and some pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there who had come from every town of galilee and judaea and from jerusalem and the power of the lord was with him to make those who were ill free from their diseases
 and some men had with them on a bed a man who was ill without power of moving and they made attempts to get him in and put him before jesus
 and because of the mass of people there was no way to get him in so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof on his bed into the middle in front of jesus
 and seeing their faith he said man you have forgiveness for your sins
 and the scribes and pharisees were having an argument saying who is this who has no respect for god who is able to give forgiveness for sins but god only
 but jesus who had knowledge of their thoughts said to them why are you reasoning in your hearts
 which is the simpler to say you have forgiveness for your sins or to say get up and go
 but so that you may see that on earth the son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins  he said to the man who was ill  i say to you get up and take up your bed and go into your house
 and straight away he got up before them and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to god
 and wonder overcame them all and they gave glory to god and they were full of fear saying we have seen strange things today
 and after these things he went out and saw levi a tax farmer seated at the place where taxes were taken and said to him come after me
 and giving up his business he got up and went after him
 and levi made a great feast for him in his house and a great number of tax farmers and others were seated at table with them
 and the pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples saying why do you take food and drink with tax farmers and sinners
 and jesus answering said to them those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill
 i have come not to get the upright but sinners so that they may be turned from their sins
 and they said to him the disciples of john frequently go without food and make prayers and so do the disciples of the pharisees but your disciples take food and drink
 and jesus said are you able to make the friends of the newly married man go without food when he is with them
 but the days will come when he will be taken away from them and then they will go without food
 and he said to them in a story no man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old
 and no man puts new wine into old wine skins for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine and the wine be let out and the skins come to destruction
 but new wine has to be put into new wine skins
 and no man having had old wine has any desire for new for he says the old is better
 now it came about that on the sabbath he was going through the fields of grain and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food crushing them in their hands
 but some of the pharisees said why do you do what it is not right to do on the sabbath
 and jesus said have you not seen in the writings what david did when he was in need of food he and those who were with him
 how he went into the house of god and took for food the holy bread which only the priests may take and gave it to those who were with him
 and he said the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
 and it came about on another sabbath that he went into the synagogue and was teaching there and a man was there whose right hand was dead
 and the scribes and pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the sabbath so that they might be able to say something against him
 but he had knowledge of their thoughts and he said to the man whose hand was dead get up and come into the middle and he got up and came forward
 and jesus said i put the question to you is it right to do good on the sabbath or to do evil to give life or to take it away
 and looking round on all of them he said to him put out your hand and he did so and his hand was made well
 but they were full of wrath and were talking together about what they might do to jesus
 and it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer and he was all night in prayer to god
 and the day came and turning to his disciples he made a selection from among them of twelve to whom he gave the name of apostles
 simon to whom he gave the name of peter and andrew his brother and james and john and philip and bartholomew
 and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and simon who was named the zealot
 and judas the son of james and judas iscariot he who was false to him
 and he came down with them to a level place and a great band of his disciples and a very great number of people from all judaea and jerusalem and from the parts of tyre and sidon by the sea came to give hearing to him and to be made well from their diseases
 and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were made well
 and all the people were desiring to be touched by him for power came from him and made them all well
 and turning his eyes to his disciples he said happy are you who are poor for the kingdom of god is yours
 happy are you who are in need of food now for you will be made full happy are you who are weeping now for you will be glad
 happy are you when men have hate for you and put you away from among them and say angry words to you turning away in disgust at your name because of the son of man
 be glad in that day and be lifted up for joy for your reward in heaven will be great for their fathers did these same things to the prophets
 but unhappy are you who have wealth for you have been comforted now
 unhappy are you who are full of food now for you will be in need unhappy are you who are laughing now for you will be crying in sorrow
 unhappy are you when all men give you their approval for so their fathers did to the false prophets
 but i say to you who give ear to me have love for those who are against you do good to those who have hate for you
 give blessing to those who give you curses say prayers for those who are cruel to you
 if a man gives you a blow on one side of your face then let the other side be turned to him from him who takes away your coat do not keep back your robe
 give to everyone who comes with a request and if a man takes away your property make no attempt to get it back again
 do to others as you would have them do to you
 if you have love for those who have love for you what credit is it to you for even sinners have love for those who have love for them
 and if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is it to you for even sinners do the same
 and if you let those have the use of your money from whom you are hoping to get it back what credit is it to you even sinners do so to sinners hoping to get back as much as they gave
 but be loving to those who are against you and do them good and give them your money not giving up hope and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the most high for he is kind to evil men and to those who have hard hearts
 be full of pity even as your father is full of pity
 be not judges of others and you will not be judged do not give punishment to others and you will not get punishment yourselves make others free and you will be made free
 give and it will be given to you good measure crushed down full and running over they will give to you for in the same measure as you give it will be given to you again
 and he gave them teaching in the form of a story saying is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another will they not go falling together into a hole
 the disciple is not greater than his master but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master
 and why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brothers eye but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye
 how will you say to your brother brother let me take the grain of dust out of your eye when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye o false one  first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your brothers eye
 for no good tree gives bad fruit and no bad tree gives good fruit
 for every tree is judged by its fruit men do not get figs from thorns or grapes from blackberry plants
 the good man out of the good store of his heart gives good things and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth
 why do you say to me lord lord and do not the things which i say
 everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them i will make clear to you what he is like
 he is like a man building a house who went deep and put the base of it on a rock and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house it was not moved because the building was good
 but he who gives hearing without doing is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it and when the force of the river came against it straight away it came down and the destruction of that house was great
 after he had come to the end of all his words in the hearing of the people he went into capernaum
 and a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him this servant was ill and near to death
 and when news of jesus came to his ears he sent to him rulers of the jews requesting that he would come and make his servant well
 and they when they came to jesus made their request warmly saying
 it is right for you to do this for him because he is a friend to our nation and himself has put up a synagogue for us
 and jesus went with them and when he was not far from the house the man sent friends to him saying lord do not give yourself trouble for i am not important enough for you to come into my house
 and i had the feeling that i was not even good enough to come to you but say the word only and my servant will be well
 for i myself am a man under authority having men under me and i say to this one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it
 and when these things were said to jesus he was surprised and turning to the mass of people coming after him said i have not seen such great faith no not in israel
 and when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well
 and it came about after a little time that he went to a town named nain and his disciples went with him and a great number of people
 now when he came near the door of the town a dead man was being taken out the only son of his mother who was a widow and a great number of people from the town were with her
 and when the lord saw her he had pity on her and said to her be not sad
 and he came near and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was and those who were moving it came to a stop and he said young man i say to you get up
 and the dead man got up and words came from his lips and he gave him to his mother
 and fear came on all and they gave praise to god saying a great prophet is among us and god has given thought to his people
 and this story about him went through all judaea and the places round about
 and the disciples of john gave him an account of all these things
 then john sent two of his disciples to the lord saying are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
 and when the men came to him they said john the baptist has sent us to you saying are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
 at that time he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains and from evil spirits and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes
 and answering them he said go back and give news to john of what you have seen and the things which have come to your ears the blind now see those who had no power in their legs are walking lepers are made clean those who had no hearing now have their ears open dead men come to life again and the poor have the good news given to them
 and a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me
 and when the men who were sent by john had gone away he said to the people about john what did you go out into the waste land to see a tall stem moving in the wind
 but what did you go out to see a man in soft clothing see now those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings houses
 but what did you go out to see a prophet yes i say to you and more than a prophet
 this is he of whom it has been said see i send my servant before your face who will make ready your way before you
 i say to you among all the sons of women not one is greater than john but he who is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he
  and all the people and the tax farmers to whom john had given baptism when they had knowledge of these things gave glory to god
 but the pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of god for themselves not having had his baptism 
 what comparison am i to make of the men of this generation what are they like
 they are like children who are seated in the market place crying out to one another and saying we made music for you but you did not take part in the dance we gave cries of sorrow but you were not sad
 for john the baptist came taking no food or drink and you say he has an evil spirit
 the son of man came feasting and you say here is a lover of food and wine a friend of tax farmers and sinners
 but wisdom is judged to be right by all her children
 and one of the pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him and he went into the pharisees house and took his seat at the table
 and there was a woman in the town who was a sinner and when she had news that he was a guest in the pharisees house she took a bottle of perfume
 and went in and took her place at the back of him near his feet weeping so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes and with her hair she made them dry and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them
 now when the pharisee in whose house he was saw it he said to himself this man if he was a prophet would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him that she is a sinner
 and jesus answering said simon i have something to say to you and he said master say on
 and he said two men were in debt to a certain man of business one had a debt of five hundred pence and the other of fifty
 when they were unable to make payment he made the two of them free of their debts which of them now will have the greater love for him
 simon in answer said it seems he whose debt was greater and he said your decision is right
 and turning to the woman he said to simon you see this woman i came into your house you did not give me water for my feet but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes and drying them with her hair
 you did not give me a kiss but she from the time when i came in has gone on kissing my feet
 you put no oil on my head but she has put perfume on my feet
 and so i say to you she will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number because of her great love but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love
 and he said to her you have forgiveness for your sins
 and those who were seated at table with him said to themselves who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins
 and he said to the woman by your faith you have salvation go in peace
 and it came about after a short time that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of god and with him were the twelve
 and certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases mary named magdalene from whom seven evil spirits had gone out
 and joanna the wife of chuza herods chief house servant and susanna and a number of others who gave him of their wealth for his needs
 and when a great number of people came together and men from every town went out to him he gave them teaching in the form of a story
 a man went out to put in seed and while he was doing it some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot and was taken by the birds of heaven
 and some went on the rock and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water
 and some went among thorns and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth
 and some falling on good earth came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much and with these words he said in a loud voice he who has ears let him give ear
 and his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story
 and he said to you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of god but to the others they are given in stories so that seeing they may not see and though they give hearing the sense will not be clear to them
 now this is the point of the story the seed is the word of god
 those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing then the evil one comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not have faith and get salvation
 and those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word but having no root they have faith for a time and when the test comes they give up
 and those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing and go on their way but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life and they give no fruit
 and those in the good earth are those who having given ear to the word keep it with a good and true heart and in quiet strength give fruit
 no man when the light is lighted puts a cover over it or puts it under a bed but he puts it on its table so that those who come in may see the light
 for nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light
 so take care how you give hearing for to him who has will be given and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have
 and his mother and his brothers came to him and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people
 and someone said to him your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you
 but he said to them in answer my mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of god and do it
 now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples and he said to them let us go over to the other side of the water and they put out the boat
 but while they were sailing he went to sleep and a storm of wind came down on the sea and the boat became full of water and they were in danger
 then they came to him and awaking him out of his sleep said master master destruction is near and he when he was awake gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves and the storm came to an end and all was calm
 and he said to them where is your faith and fear and wonder overcame them and they said to one another who then is this who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says
 and they came to the country of the gerasenes which is opposite galilee
 and when he had come to the land there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits and for a long time he had had no clothing on and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead
 and when he saw jesus he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said what have i to do with you jesus son of the most high god do not be cruel to me
 for he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man for frequently it would take a grip of him and he was kept under control and prisoned with chains but parting the chains in two he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places
 and jesus said to him what is your name and he said legion for a number of spirits had gone into him
 and they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep
 now there was a great herd of pigs in that place getting food on the mountain and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs and he let them
 and the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction
 and when the men who took care of them saw what had come about they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country
 and they went out to see what had taken place and they came to jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone seated clothed and with full use of his senses at the feet of jesus and fear came on them
 and those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well
 and all the people of the country of the gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them for they were in great fear and he got into a boat and went back
 but the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him but he sent him away saying
 go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which god has done for you and he went away giving word through all the town of the great things which jesus had done for him
 and when jesus went back the people were glad to see him for they were all waiting for him
 then there came a man named jairus who was a ruler in the synagogue and he went down at the feet of jesus desiring him to come to his house
 for he had an only daughter about twelve years old and she was near to death but while he was on his way the people were pushing to be near him
 and a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years and had given all her money to medical men and not one of them was able to make her well
 came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped
 and jesus said who was touching me and when they all said it is not i peter and those who were with him said master the people are pushing round you on every side
 but jesus said someone was touching me for i had the feeling that power had gone out from me
 and when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret she came shaking with fear and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him and how she was made well straight away
 and he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace
 while he was still talking someone came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue saying your daughter is dead do not go on troubling the master
 but jesus at these words said to him have no fear only have faith and she will be made well
 and when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him but only peter and john and james and the father of the girl and her mother
 and all the people were weeping and crying for her but he said do not be sad for she is not dead but sleeping
 and they were laughing at him being certain that she was dead
 but he taking her hand said to her my child get up
 and her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away and he gave orders that food was to be given to her
 and her father and mother were full of wonder but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone
 and getting the twelve together he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases to make them well
 and he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of god and to make well those who were ill
 and he said to them take nothing for your journey no stick or bag or bread or money and do not take two coats
 and if you go into a house let that house be your resting place till you go away
 and if any people will not take you in when you go away from that town put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them
 and they went away journeying through all the towns preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places
 now herod the king had news of all these things and he was in doubt because it was said by some people that john had come back from the dead
 and by some that elijah had come and by others that one of the old prophets had come back to life
 and herod said i put john to death but who is this of whom such stories are given to me and he had a desire to see him
 and the twelve when they came back gave him an account of what they had done and he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named beth saida
 but the people getting news of it went after him and he was pleased to see them and gave them teaching about the kingdom of god and made those well who were in need of it
 and the day went on and the twelve came to him and said send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting places and food for themselves for we are in a waste place
 but he said give them food yourselves and they said we have only five cakes of bread and two fishes if we do not go and get food for all these people
 for there were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them be seated in groups about fifty to a group
 and they did so and made them all be seated
 and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing over them and when they had been broken he gave them to the disciples to give to the people
 and they all took the food and had enough and they took up of the broken bits which were over twelve baskets full
 and it came about that when he was in prayer by himself and the disciples were with him he put a question to them saying who do the people say i am
 and they answering said john the baptist but others say elijah and others that one of the old prophets has come back
 and he said but who do you say that i am and peter answering said the christ of god
 but he gave them special orders not to say this to any man
 saying the son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law and be put to death and on the third day he will come back to life
 and he said to them all if any man has a desire to come after me let him give up all and take up his cross every day and come after me
 for whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him but whoever gives up his life because of me will keep it
 for what profit will a man have if he gets all the world but undergoes loss or destruction himself
 for if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words the son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the holy angels
 but truly i say to you some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of god
 and about eight days after he had said these things he took peter and john and james with him and went up into the mountain for prayer
 and while he was in prayer his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining
 and two men moses and elijah were talking with him
 who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in jerusalem
 now peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep but when they were fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who were with him
 and when they were about to go away from him peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here let us make three tents one for you and one for moses and one for elijah having no knowledge of what he was saying
 and while he said these things the shade of a cloud came over them and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud
 and there was a voice from the cloud saying this is my son the man of my selection give ear to him
 and after the voice was gone they saw that jesus was by himself and they kept quiet and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen
 and on the day after when they came down from the mountain a great band of people came to him
 and a man from among them crying out said master i make a request to you give a thought to my son for he is my only child
 and see a spirit takes him and suddenly he gives a cry twisted in pain and streaming at the lips and when it goes away from him at last he is marked as from blows
 and i made a request to your disciples to send it out of him but they were not able to do it
 and jesus said o generation without faith and false in heart how long will i have to be with you and put up with you let your son come here
 and while he was coming he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit but jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit and made the boy well and gave him back to his father
 and they were full of wonder at the great power of god but while they were all wondering at all the things which he did he said to his disciples
 let these words go deep into your ears for the son of man will be given up into the hands of men
 but this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it and they had fear of questioning him about it
 now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest
 but when jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts he took a small child and put him by his side
 and said to them whoever gives honour to this child in my name gives honour to me and whoever gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me for whoever is least among you all that man is great
 and john answering said master we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name and we did not let him do it because he was not one of us
 but jesus said to him let him do it for he who is not against you is for you
 and it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up his face was turned to go to jerusalem
 and he sent men before and they came to a small town of samaria to make ready for him
 but they would not have him there because he was clearly going to jerusalem
 and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them
 but turning round he said sharp words to them
 and they went to another small town
 and when they were on the way a certain man said to him i will come after you wherever you go
 and jesus said to him foxes have holes and the birds of the air have resting places but the son of man has nowhere to put his head
 and he said to another come after me but he said lord let me first go and give the last honours to my father
 but he said to him let the dead take care of their dead it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of god
 and another man said i will come with you lord but first let me say a last good day to those who are at my house
 but jesus said no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is good enough for the kingdom of god
 the first words of the good news of jesus christ the son of god
 even as it is said in the book of isaiah the prophet see i send my servant before your face who will make ready your way
 the voice of one crying in the waste land make ready the way of the lord make his roads straight
 john came and gave baptism in the waste land preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed
 and there went out to him all the people of judaea and all those of jerusalem and they were given baptism by him in the river jordan saying that they were sinners
 and john was clothed in camels hair with a leather band about him and his food was locusts and honey
 and he said to them all there is one coming after me who is greater than i whose shoes i am not good enough to undo
 i have given you baptism with water but he will give you baptism with the holy spirit
 and it came about in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was given baptism by john in the jordan
 and straight away coming up out of the water he saw the heavens broken open and the spirit coming down on him as a dove
 and a voice came out of heaven you are my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 and straight away the spirit sent him out into the waste land
 and he was in the waste land for forty days being tested by satan and he was with the beasts and the angels took care of him
 now after john had been put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the good news of god
 and saying the time has come and the kingdom of god is near let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news
 and going by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon putting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
 and jesus said to them come after me and i will make you fishers of men
 and they went straight from their nets and came after him
 and going on a little farther he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who were in their boat stitching up their nets
 and he said come after me and they went away from their father zebedee who was in the boat with the servants and came after him
 and they came to capernaum and on the sabbath he went into the synagogue and gave teaching
 and they were full of wonder at his teaching because he gave it as one having authority and not like the scribes
 and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he gave a cry
 saying what have we to do with you jesus of nazareth have you come to put an end to us i see well who you are the holy one of god
 and jesus said to him sharply be quiet and come out of him
 and the unclean spirit shaking him violently and crying with a loud voice came out of him
 and they were all greatly surprised so that they put questions to one another saying what is this a new teaching  with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits and they do what he says
 and news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of galilee round about
 and when they came out of the synagogue they went into the house of simon and andrew with james and john
 now simons wifes mother was ill with a burning heat and they gave him word of her
 and he came and took her by the hand lifting her up and she became well and took care of their needs
 and in the evening at sundown they took to him all who were diseased and those who had evil spirits
 and all the town had come together at the door
 and a number who were ill with different diseases he made well and sent out evil spirits but he did not let the evil spirits say anything because they had knowledge of him
 and in the morning a long time before daylight he got up and went out to a quiet place and there he gave himself up to prayer
 and simon and those who were with him came after him
 and when they came up with him they said to him everyone is looking for you
 and he said to them let us go to other parts into the nearest towns so that i may give teaching there because for this purpose i came
 and he went into their synagogues in every part of galilee preaching and driving out evil spirits
 and a leper came to him and going down on his knees before him made a request saying if it is your pleasure you have the power to make me clean
 and being moved with pity he put out his hand and touching him said to him it is my pleasure be made clean
 and straight away the disease went from him and he was made clean
 and he sent him away saying to him very sharply
 see that you say nothing to any man but go and let the priest see you and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by moses for a witness to them
 but he went out and made it public giving an account of it everywhere so that jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town but was outside in the waste land and they came to him from every part
 and he got up and went into the country of judaea on the other side of jordan and great numbers of people came together to him again and as was his way he gave them teaching
 and pharisees came to him testing him with the question is it right for a man to put away his wife
 and he said to them in answer what did moses say you were to do
 and they said to him moses let us give her a statement in writing and be free from her
 but jesus said to them because of your hard hearts he gave you this law
 but from the first male and female made he them
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife
 and the two will become one flesh so that they are no longer two but one flesh
 let not that which has been joined together by god be parted by man
 and in the house the disciples put questions to him again about this thing
 and he said to them whoever puts away his wife and takes another is false to his wife
 and if she herself puts away her husband and takes another she is false to her husband
 and they took to him little children so that he might put his hands on them and the disciples said sharp words to them
 and when jesus saw it he was angry and said to them let the little children come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of god
 truly i say to you whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of god like a little child will not come into it at all
 and he took them in his arms and gave them a blessing putting his hands on them
 and while he was going out into the way a man came running to him and went down on his knees saying good master what have i to do so that i may have eternal life
 and jesus said to him why do you say i am good no one is good but one and that is god
 you have knowledge of what is said in the law do not put any one to death do not be untrue in married life do not take what is not yours do not give false witness do not get money by deceit give honour to your father and mother
 and he said to him master all these laws i have kept from the time when i was young
 and jesus looking on him and loving him said there is one thing needed go get money for your goods and give it to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come with me
 but his face became sad at the saying and he went away sorrowing for he was one who had much property
 and jesus looking round about said to his disciples how hard it is for those who have wealth to come into the kingdom of god 
 and the disciples were full of wonder at his words but jesus said to them again children how hard it is for those who put faith in wealth to come into the kingdom of god 
 it is simpler for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a man of wealth to come into the kingdom of god
 and they were greatly surprised saying to him who then may have salvation
 jesus looking on them said with men it is impossible but not with god for all things are possible with god
 peter said to him see we have given up everything and come after you
 jesus said truly i say to you there is no man who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or land because of me and the good news
 who will not get a hundred times as much now in this time houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and land  though with great troubles and in the world to come eternal life
 but a great number who are first will be last and those who are last will be first
 and they were on the way going up to jerusalem and jesus was going before them and they were full of wonder but those who came after him were in fear and again he took the twelve and gave them word of the things which were to come on him
 saying see we go up to jerusalem and the son of man will be given up to the chief priests and the scribes and they will give an order for his death and will give him up to the gentiles
 and they will make sport of him and put shame on him and give him cruel blows and will put him to death and after three days he will come back from the dead
 and there came to him james and john the sons of zebedee saying to him master will you give us whatever may be our request
 and he said to them what would you have me do for you
 and they said to him let us be seated one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory
 but jesus said to them you have no knowledge of what you are saying are you able to take of my cup or to undergo the baptism which i am to undergo
 and they said to him we are able and jesus said to them you will take of the cup from which i take and the baptism which i am about to undergo you will undergo
 but to be seated at my right hand or at my left is not for me to give but it is for those for whom it has been made ready
 and hearing this the ten became very angry with james and john
 and jesus made them come to him and said to them you see that those who are made rulers over the gentiles are lords over them and their great ones have authority over them
 but it is not so among you but whoever has a desire to become great among you let him be your servant
 and whoever has a desire to be first among you let him be servant of all
 for truly the son of man did not come to have servants but to be a servant and to give his life for the salvation of men
 and they came to jericho and when he was going out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people the son of timaeus bartimaeus a blind man was seated by the wayside with his hand out for money
 and when it came to his ears that it was jesus of nazareth he gave a cry and said jesus son of david have mercy on me
 and some of them turning in protest gave him an order to be quiet but he went on crying out all the more son of david have mercy on me
 and jesus came to a stop and said let him come and crying out to the blind man they said to him be comforted come he has sent for you
 and he putting off his coat got up quickly and came to jesus
 and jesus said to him what would you have me do to you and the blind man said master make me able to see
 and jesus said to him go on your way your faith has made you well and straight away he was able to see and went after him in the way
 and when they came near to jerusalem to beth phage and bethany at the mountain of olives he sent two of his disciples
 and said to them go into the little town opposite and when you come to it you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck on which no man has ever been seated let him loose and come back with him
 and if anyone says to you why are you doing this say the lord has need of him and will send him back straight away
 and they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street and they were getting him loose
 and some of those who were there said to them what are you doing taking the ass
 and they said to them the words which jesus had said and they let them go
 and they took the young ass to jesus and put their clothing on him and he got on his back
 and a great number put down their clothing in the way and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields
 and those who went in front and those who came after were crying glory a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord
 a blessing on the coming kingdom of our father david glory in the highest
 and he went into jerusalem into the temple and after looking round about on all things it being now evening he went out to bethany with the twelve
 and on the day after when they had come out from bethany he was in need of food
 and seeing a fig tree in the distance with leaves he went to see if by chance it had anything on it and when he came to it he saw nothing but leaves for it was not the time for the fruit
 and he said to it let no man take fruit from you for ever and his disciples took note of his words
 and they came to jerusalem and he went into the temple and sent out those who were trading there overturning the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money
 and he would not let any man take a vessel through the temple
 and he gave them teaching and said to them is it not in the writings my house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations but you have made it a hole of thieves
 and it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes and they took thought how they might put him to death being in fear of him because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching
 and every evening he went out of the town
 and when they were going by in the morning they saw the fig tree dead from the roots
 and peter having a memory of it said to him master see the tree which was cursed by you is dead
 and jesus answering said to them have gods faith
 truly i say to you whoever says to this mountain be taken up and be put into the sea and has no doubt in his heart but has faith that what he says will come about he will have his desire
 for this reason i say to you whatever you make a request for in prayer have faith that it has been given to you and you will have it
 and whenever you make a prayer let there be forgiveness in your hearts if you have anything against anyone so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your father who is in heaven
   
 and they came again to jerusalem and while he was walking in the temple there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority
 and they said to him by what authority do you do these things or who gave you authority to do these things
 and jesus said to them i will put to you one question give me an answer and i will say by what authority i do these things
 the baptism of john was it from heaven or from men give me an answer
 and they gave thought to it among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say why then did you not have faith in him
 but if we say from men  they were in fear of the people because all took john to be truly a prophet
 and they said in answer to jesus we have no idea and jesus said to them and i will not say to you by what authority i do these things
 and he gave them teaching in the form of stories a man had a vine garden planted and put a wall about it and made a place for crushing out the wine and put up a tower and let it out to field workers and went into another country
 and when the time came he sent a servant to get from the workmen some of the fruit of the garden
 and they took him and gave him blows and sent him away with nothing
 and again he sent to them another servant and they gave him wounds on the head and were very cruel to him
 and he sent another and they put him to death and a number of others whipping some and putting some to death
 he still had one a dearly loved son he sent him last to them saying they will have respect for my son
 but those workmen said among themselves this is he who will one day be the owner of the property come let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours
 and they took him and put him to death pushing his body out of the garden
 what then will the master of the garden do he will come and put the workmen to death and will give the garden into the hands of others
 have you not seen this which is in the writings the stone which the builders put on one side the same was made the chief stone of the building
 this was the lords doing and it is a wonder in our eyes
 and they made attempts to take him but they were in fear of the people because they saw that the story was against them and they went away from him
 then they sent to him certain of the pharisees and the herodians so that they might make use of his words to take him by a trick
 and when they had come they said to him master we are certain that you are true and have no fear of anyone you have no respect for a mans position but you are teaching the true way of god is it right to give taxes to caesar or not
 are we to give or not to give but he conscious of their false hearts said to them why do you put me to the test give me a penny so that i may see it
 and they gave him one and he said to them whose is this image and name on it and they said to him caesars
 and jesus said to them give to caesar the things which are caesars and to god the things which are gods and they were full of wonder at him
 and there came to him sadducees who say there is no coming back from the dead and they put a question to him saying
 master in the law moses says if a mans brother comes to his end and has a wife still living and no child it is right for his brother to take his wife and get a family for his brother
 there were seven brothers and the first took a wife and at his death there were no offspring
 and the second took her and at his death there were no offspring and the third the same
 and all the seven had no seed last of all the woman herself came to her death
 in the future life when they come back from the dead whose wife will she be for the seven had her for a wife
 jesus said to them is not this the reason for your error that you have no knowledge of the holy writings or of the power of god
 when they come back from the dead they do not get married but are like the angels in heaven
 but as to the dead coming back to life have you not seen in the book of moses about the burning thorn tree how god said to him i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
 he is not the god of the dead but of the living you are greatly in error
 and one of the scribes came and hearing their argument together and seeing that he had given them a good answer put the question to him which law is the first of all
 jesus said in answer the first is give ear o israel the lord our god is one lord
 and you are to have love for the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
 the second is this have love for your neighbour as for yourself there is no other law greater than these
 and the scribe said to him truly master you have well said that he is one and there is no other but he
 and to have love for him with all the heart and with all the mind and with all the strength and to have the same love for his neighbour as for himself is much more than all forms of offerings
 and when jesus saw that he gave a wise answer he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god and every man after that was in fear of questioning him any more
 and jesus when he was teaching in the temple said how do the scribes say that the christ is the son of david
 david himself said in the holy spirit the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand till i put those who are against you under your feet
 david himself gives him the name of lord and how then is he his son and the common people gave ear to him gladly
 and in his teaching he said be on your watch against the scribes whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes and be respected in the market places
 and to have the chief seats in the synagogues and the first places at feasts
 who take away the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers these will be judged more hardly
 and he took a seat by the place where the money was kept and saw how the people put money into the boxes and a number who had wealth put in much
 and there came a poor widow and she put in two little bits of money which make a farthing
 and he made his disciples come to him and said to them truly i say to you this poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting money into the box
 because they all put in something out of what they had no need for but she out of her need put in all she had even all her living
 and when he was going out of the temple one of his disciples said to him master see what stones and what buildings 
 and jesus said to him do you see these great buildings there is not one stone here resting on another which will not be overturned
 and while he was seated on the mountain of olives opposite the temple peter and james and john and andrew said to him privately
 say when these things will be and what will be the sign when these things are all about to be done
 and jesus said to them take care that you are not tricked by anyone
 people will come in my name saying i am he and a number will be turned from the true way
 and when you have news of wars and talk of wars do not be troubled these things have to be but it is still not the end
 nation will go to war with nation and kingdom with kingdom there will be earth shocks in different places there will be times when there is no food these things are the first of the troubles
 but take care for they will give you up to the sanhedrins and in synagogues you will be whipped and you will be taken before rulers and kings because of me for a sign to them
 and the good news has first to be given to all the nations
 and when you are taken and given up to be judged do not be troubled about what to say but whatever is given to you in that hour say because it is not you who say it but the holy spirit
 and brother will give up brother to death and the father his child and children will go against their fathers and mothers and put them to death
 and you will be hated by all men because of my name but he who goes through to the end will have salvation
 but when you see the unclean thing which makes destruction in the place where it has no right to be  let this be clear to the reader  then let those who are in judaea go quickly to the mountains
 and let him who is on the house top not go down or go in to take anything out of his house
 and let not him who is in the field go back to take his coat
 and it will be hard for women who are with child and for her who has a baby at the breast in those days
 and say a prayer that it may not be in the winter
 for in those days there will be sorrow such as there has not been from the time when god made the world till now and will not ever be again
 and if the lord had not made the time short no flesh would have been kept from destruction but because of the saints he has made the time short
 and then if any man says to you see here is christ or see there have no faith in it
 because there will be false christs and false prophets and they will give signs and wonders in the hope of turning even the saints from the true way
 but take care see i have made all things clear to you before the time
 but in those days after that time of trouble the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light
 and the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers which are in the heavens will be moved
 and then they will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory
 and then he will send out the angels and will get together his saints from the four winds from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven
 take an example from the fig tree when its branches become soft and put out their leaves you see that the summer is near
 even so when you see these things taking place you may be certain that he is near even at the doors
 truly i say to you this generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete
 heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
 but of that day or that hour no one has knowledge not even the angels in heaven or the son but the father
 take care keep watch with prayer for you are not certain when the time will be
 it is as when a man who is in another country for a time having gone away from his house and given authority to his servants and to everyone his work gives the porter an order to keep watch
 so you are to keep watch because you are not certain when the master of the house is coming in the evening or in the middle of the night or at the cocks cry or in the morning
 for fear that coming suddenly he sees you sleeping
 and what i say to you i say to all keep watch
 it was now two days before the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes made designs how they might take him by deceit and put him to death
 but they said not while the feast is going on for fear there may be trouble among the people
 and while he was in bethany in the house of simon the leper seated at table there came a woman with a bottle of perfumed oil of great price and when the bottle was broken she put the perfume on his head
 but some of them were angry among themselves saying for what purpose has this oil been wasted
 we might have got more than three hundred pence for it and given the money to the poor and they said things against her among themselves
 but jesus said let her be why are you troubling her she has done a kind act to me
 the poor you have ever with you and whenever you have the desire you may do them good but me you have not for ever
 she has done what she was able she has put oil on my body to make it ready for its last resting place
 and truly i say to you wherever the good news goes out through all the earth what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her
 and judas iscariot who was one of the twelve went away to the chief priests so that he might give him up to them
 and hearing what he said they were glad and gave him their word to make him a payment of money and he took thought how he might best give him up to them
 and on the first day of unleavened bread when the passover lamb is put to death his disciples said to him where are we to go and make ready for you to take the passover meal
 and he sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the town and there will come to you a man with a vessel of water go after him
 and wherever he goes in say to the owner of the house the master says where is my guest room where i may take the passover with my disciples
 and he will take you up himself to a great room with a table and seats there make ready for us
 and the disciples went out and came into the town and saw that it was as he had said and they made ready the passover
 and when it was evening he came with the twelve
 and while they were seated taking food jesus said truly i say to you one of you will be false to me one who is taking food with me
 they were sad and said to him one by one is it i
 and he said to them it is one of the twelve one who is putting his bread with me into the same plate
 the son of man goes even as the writings say of him but cursed is that man through whom the son of man is given up  it would have been well for that man if he had never been given birth
 and while they were taking food he took bread and after blessing it he gave the broken bread to them and said take it this is my body
 and he took a cup and when he had given praise he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it
 and he said to them this is my blood of the testament which is given for men
 truly i say to you i will take no more of the fruit of the vine till the day when i take it new in the kingdom of god
 and after a song of praise to god they went out to the mountain of olives
 and jesus said to them you will all be turned away from me for it is in the writings i will put the keeper of the sheep to death and the sheep will be put to flight
 but after i have come back from the dead i will go before you into galilee
 but peter said to him though the others may be turned away from you i will not
 and jesus said to him truly i say to you that you today even this night before the cocks second cry will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
 but he said with passion if i have to be put to death with you i will not be false to you and they all said the same
 and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he said to his disciples be seated here while i say a prayer
 and he took with him peter and james and john and grief and great trouble came on him
 and he said to them my soul is very sad even to death be here a little time and keep watch
 and he went forward a little and falling down on the earth made request that if possible the hour might go from him
 and he said abba father all things are possible to you take away this cup from me but even so let not my pleasure but yours be done
 and he came and saw them sleeping and said to peter simon are you sleeping were you not able to keep watch one hour
 keep watch with prayer so that you may not be put to the test the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is feeble
 and again he went away and said a prayer using the same words
 and again he came and saw them sleeping because their eyes were very tired and they had nothing to say in answer
 and he came the third time and said to them go on sleeping now and take your rest it is enough the hour has come see the son of man is given up into the hands of evil men
 get up let us be going see he who gives me up is near
 and straight away while he was still talking judas one of the twelve came and with him a great band with swords and sticks from the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority
 now he who had been false to him had given them a sign saying the one to whom i give a kiss that is he take him and get him away safely
 and when he had come he went straight to him and said master and gave him a kiss
 and they put their hands on him and took him
 but a certain one of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow cutting off his ear
 and jesus said to them have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me
 i was with you every day in the temple teaching and you did not take me but this is done so that the writings may come true
 and they all went away from him in fear
 and a certain young man went after him with only a linen cloth about his body and they put their hands on him
 but he got away unclothed without the linen cloth
 and they took jesus away to the high priest and there came together with him all the chief priests and those in authority and the scribes
 and peter had come after him at a distance even into the house of the high priest and he was seated with the captains warming himself in the light of the fire
 now the chief priests and all the sanhedrin were looking for witness against jesus so that they might put him to death and they were unable to get any
 for a number gave false witness against him and their witness was not in agreement
 then some got up and gave false witness against him saying
 he said in our hearing i will put an end to this temple which is made with hands and in three days i will make another without hands
 and even so their witness was not in agreement
 and the high priest got up in the middle of them and said to jesus do you say nothing in answer what is it which these say against you
 but he kept quiet and said nothing again the high priest questioning him said are you the christ the son of the holy one
 and jesus said i am and you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven
 and the high priest violently parting his robes said what more need have we of witnesses
 his words against god have come to your ears what is your opinion and they all said it was right for him to be put to death
 and some put shame on him and covering his face gave him blows and said to him now say what is to come and the captains took him and gave him blows with their hands
 and while peter was down in the open square of the building one of the servant girls of the high priest came
 and seeing peter warming himself by the fire she gave him a look and said you were with this nazarene even jesus
 but he said i have no knowledge of him or of what you are saying and he went out into the doorway and there came the cry of a cock
 and the girl saw him and said again to those who were near this is one of them
 but again he said it was not so and after a little time again those who were near said to peter truly you are one of them for you are a galilaean
 but with curses and oaths he said i have no knowledge of the man about whom you are talking
 and in the same minute the cock gave a second cry and it came to peters mind how jesus had said to him before the cocks second cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me and at this thought he was overcome with weeping
 and the first thing in the morning the chief priests with those in authority and the scribes and all the sanhedrin had a meeting and put cords round jesus and took him away and gave him up to pilate
 and pilate put a question to him are you the king of the jews and he answering said to him you say so
 and the chief priests said a number of things against him
 and pilate again put a question do you say nothing in answer see how much evil they say you have done
 but jesus gave no more answers so that pilate was full of wonder
 now at the feast every year he let one prisoner go free at their request
 and there was one named barabbas in prison with those who had gone against the government and in the fight had taken life
 and the people went up requesting him to do as he had done for them in other years
 and pilate said in answer to them is it your desire that i let the king of the jews go free
 for he saw that the chief priests had given him up through envy
 but the people were moved by the chief priests to make him let barabbas go free
 and pilate again said in answer to them what then am i to do to him to whom you give the name of the king of the jews
 and they said again loudly to the cross with him 
 and pilate said to them why what evil has he done but their cry was the louder to the cross 
 and pilate desiring to do what was pleasing to the people let barabbas go free and gave up jesus when he had been whipped to be put to death on the cross
 and the men of the army took him away into the square in front of the building which is the praetorium and they got together all the band
 and they put a purple robe on him and twisting a crown of thorns they put it on him
 and as if honouring him they said long life to the king of the jews 
 and they gave him blows on the head with a stick and put shame on him and going down on their knees gave him worship
 and when they had made sport of him they took the purple robe off him and put his clothing on him and they took him out to put him to death on the cross
 and they made one simon of cyrene the father of alexander and rufus who was going by coming from the country go with them so that he might take his cross
 and they took him to the place named golgotha which is dead mans head
 and they gave him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it
 and he was nailed to the cross and they made a division of his clothing among them putting to the decision of chance what everyone was to take
 and it was the third hour when they put him on the cross
 and the statement of his crime was put in writing on the cross the king of the jews
 and they put two thieves on crosses with him one on his right side and one on his left
   
 and those who went by made sport of him shaking their heads and saying ha  you who give the temple to destruction and put it up again in three days
 keep yourself from death and come down from the cross
 in the same way the chief priests laughing at him among themselves with the scribes said a saviour of others he has no salvation for himself
 let the christ the king of israel come down now from the cross so that we may see and have belief and those who were put on crosses with him said evil things against him
 and when the sixth hour had come it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour
 and at the ninth hour jesus said in a loud voice eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is my god my god why are you turned away from me
 and some of those who were near hearing it said see he is crying to elijah
 and one of them went quickly and getting a sponge full of bitter wine put it on a rod and gave it to him for drink saying let be let us see if elijah will come to take him down
 and jesus gave a loud cry and gave up his spirit
 and the curtain of the temple was parted in two from end to end
 and when the captain who was near saw how he gave up his spirit he said truly this man was a son of god
 and there were women watching from a distance among them were mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome
 who went with him when he was in galilee and took care of him and a number of other women who came up with him to jerusalem
 and when it was evening because it was the time of getting ready that is the day before the sabbath
 there came joseph of arimathaea a responsible man in high honour who was himself waiting for the kingdom of god and he went in to pilate without fear and made a request for the body of jesus
 and pilate was surprised that he was dead and sending for the captain he put a question to see if he had been dead for long
 and when he had news of it from the captain he let joseph have the body
 and he got a linen cloth and taking him down put the linen cloth round him and put him in a place for the dead which had been cut out of a rock and a stone was rolled against the door
 and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw where he was put
 and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome got spices so that they might come and put them on him
 and very early after dawn on the first day of the week they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put
 and they were saying among themselves who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us
 and looking up they saw that the stone was rolled back and it was of great size
 and when they went in they saw a young man seated on the right side dressed in a white robe and they were full of wonder
 and he said to them do not be troubled you are looking for jesus the nazarene who has been put to death on the cross he has come back from the dead he is not here see the place where they put him 
 but go say to his disciples and to peter he goes before you into galilee there you will see him as he said to you
 and they went out quickly from the place because fear and great wonder had come on them and they said nothing to anyone because they were full of fear that 
 now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week he went first to mary magdalene from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits
 she went and gave news of it to those who had been with him while they were sorrowing and weeping
 and they when it came to their ears that he was living and had been seen by her had no belief in it
 and after these things he was seen in another form by two of them while they were walking on their way into the country
 and they went away and gave news of it to the rest and they had no belief in what was said
 and later he was seen by the eleven themselves while they were taking food and he said sharp words to them because they had no faith and their hearts were hard and because they had no belief in those who had seen him after he had come back from the dead
 and he said to them go into all the world and give the good news to everyone
 he who has faith and is given baptism will get salvation but he who has not faith will be judged
 and these signs will be with those who have faith in my name they will send out evil spirits and they will make use of new languages
 they will take up snakes and if there is poison in their drink it will do them no evil they will put their hands on those who are ill and they will get well
 so then the lord jesus after he had said these words to them was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of god
 and they went out preaching everywhere the lord working with them and giving witness to the word by the signs which came after so be it
 and when he came into capernaum again after some days the news went about that he was in the house
 and a great number had come together so that there was no longer room for them no not even about the door and he gave them teaching
 and four men came to him with one on a bed who had no power of moving
 and when they were unable to get near him because of all the people they got the roof uncovered where he was and when it was broken up they let down the bed on which the man was
 and jesus seeing their faith said to him son you have forgiveness for your sins
 but there were certain of the scribes seated there and reasoning in their hearts
 why does this man say such things he has no respect for god from whom does forgiveness come but from god only
 and jesus having knowledge in his spirit of their thoughts said to them why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts
 which is the simpler to say to a man who is ill you have forgiveness for your sins or get up take up your bed and go
 but so that you may see that the son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins on earth  he said to the man 
 i say to you get up take up your bed and go to your house
 and he got up and straight away took up the bed and went out before them all so that they were all full of wonder and gave glory to god saying we have never seen anything like this
 and he went out again by the seaside and all the people came to him and he gave them teaching
 and when he went by he saw levi the son of alphaeus seated at the place where taxes were taken and he said to him come with me and he got up and went with him
 and it came about that he was seated at meat in his house and a number of tax farmers and sinners were at table with jesus and his disciples for there were a great number of them and they came after him
 and the scribes of the pharisees when they saw that he was taking food with the tax farmers and sinners said to his disciples why does he take food and drink with such men
 and jesus hearing it said to them those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill i have come not to get the upright but sinners
 and johns disciples and the pharisees were taking no food and they came and said to him why do johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees go without food but your disciples do not
 and jesus said to them will the friends of a newly married man go without food while he is with them as long as they have him with them they will not go without food
 but the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them and then they will go without food
 no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat or the new by pulling away from the old makes a worse hole
 and no man puts new wine into old wine skins or the skins will be burst by the wine and the wine and the skins will be wasted but new wine has to be put into new wine skins
 and it came about that on the sabbath day he was going through the grain fields and while they were walking his disciples took the heads of grain
 and the pharisees said to him why are they doing what it is not right to do on the sabbath
 and he said to them have you no knowledge of what david did when he had need and was without food he and those who were with him
 how he went into the house of god when abiathar was high priest and took for food the holy bread which only the priests may take and gave it to those who were with him
 and he said to them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath
 so that the son of man is lord even of the sabbath
 and he went again into the synagogue and there was a man there whose hand was dead
 and they were watching him to see if he would make him well on the sabbath day so that they might have something against him
 and he said to the man get up and come forward
 and he said to them is it right to do good on the sabbath or to do evil to give life or to put to death but they said nothing
 and looking round on them he was angry being sad because of their hard hearts and he said to the man put out your hand and he put it out and his hand was made well
 and the pharisees went out and straight away made designs with the herodians about how they might put him to death
 and jesus went away with his disciples to the sea and a great number from galilee came after him and from judaea
 and from jerusalem and from idumaea and the other side of jordan and the country about tyre and sidon a great number hearing what great things he did came to him
 and he made a request to his disciples to have a little boat ready for him so that he might not be crushed by the people
 for he had made such a great number well that all those who were diseased were falling down before him for the purpose of touching him
 and the unclean spirits whenever they saw him went down before him crying out and saying you are the son of god
 and he gave them special orders not to say who he was
 and he went up into the mountain and sent for those whom it was his pleasure to have with him and they went to him
 and he took twelve to be with him so that he might send them out as preachers
 and give them the power of driving out evil spirits
 to simon he gave the second name of peter
 and to james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james he gave the second name of boanerges which is sons of thunder
 and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the zealot
 and judas iscariot who was false to him
 and he went into a house and the people came together again so that they were not even able to take bread
 and when his friends had news of it they went out to get him saying he is off his head
 and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said he has beelzebub and by the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men
 and turning to them he said to them in the form of a story how is it possible for satan to put out satan
 if there is division in a kingdom that kingdom will come to destruction
 and if there is division in a house that house will come to destruction
 and if satan is at war with himself and there is division in him he will not keep his place but will come to an end
 but no one is able to go into the house of the strong man and take his goods without first putting cords round the strong man and then he will take his goods
 truly i say to you the sons of men will have forgiveness for all their sins and for all the evil words they say
 but whoever says evil things against the holy spirit will never have forgiveness but the evil he has done will be with him for ever
 because they said he has an unclean spirit
 and his mother and brothers came and were outside and sent for him requesting to see him
 and a great number were seated round him and they said to him see your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you
 and he said in answer who are my mother and my brothers
 and looking round at those who were seated about him he said see my mother and my brothers 
 whoever does gods pleasure the same is my brother and sister and mother
 and again he was teaching by the seaside and a very great number of people had come to him so that he got into a boat on the sea and took his seat and all the people were on the land by the seaside
 and he gave them teaching about a number of things in the form of stories and said to them in his teaching give ear
 a man went out to put seed in the earth
 and while he was doing it some was dropped by the wayside and the birds came and took it for food
 and some went on the stones where it had not much earth and it came up straight away because the earth was not deep
 and when the sun was high it was burned and because it had no root it became dry and dead
 and some went among the thorns and the thorns came up and it had no room for growth and gave no fruit
 and some falling on good earth gave fruit coming up and increasing and giving thirty sixty and a hundred times as much
 and he said to them whoever has ears let him give ear
 and when he was by himself those who were round him with the twelve put questions to him about the purpose of the stories
 and he said to them to you is given the secret of the kingdom of god but to those who are outside all things are given in the form of stories
 so that seeing they may see and it will not be clear to them and hearing it they will not get the sense for fear that they may be turned again to me and have forgiveness
 and he said to them if you are not clear about this story how will you be clear about the others
 the seed is the word
 and these are they by the wayside where the word is planted and when they have given ear the evil one comes straight away and takes away the word which has been planted in them
 and in the same way these are they who are planted on the stones who when the word has come to their ears straight away take it with joy
 and they have no root in themselves but go on for a time then when trouble comes or pain because of the word they quickly become full of doubts
 and others are those planted among the thorns these are they who have given ear to the word
 and the cares of this life and the deceits of wealth and the desire for other things coming in put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit
 and these are they who were planted on the good earth such as give ear to the word and take it into their hearts and give fruit thirty and sixty and a hundred times as much
 and he said to them when the light comes in do people put it under a vessel or under the bed and not on its table
 there is nothing covered which will not be seen openly and nothing has been made secret which will not come to light
 if any man has ears let him give ear
 and he said to them take care what you give ear to in the same measure as you give you will get and more will be given to you
 he who has to him will be given and he who has not from him will be taken even that which he has
 and he said such is the kingdom of god as if a man put seed in the earth
 and went to sleep and got up night and day and the seed came to growth though he had no idea how
 the earth gives fruit by herself first the leaf then the head then the full grain
 but when the grain is ready he quickly sends men to get it cut because the time for cutting has come
 and he said what picture may we give of the kingdom of god or with what story may we make it clear
 it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is put in the earth is smaller than all the seeds on the earth
 but when it is planted it comes up and becomes taller than all the plants and puts out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade
 and with a number of such stories he gave them his teaching as they were able to take it
 and without a story he said nothing to them but privately to his disciples he made all things clear
 and on that day when the evening had come he said to them let us go over to the other side
 and going away from the people they took him with them as he was in the boat and other boats were with him
 and a great storm of wind came up and the waves came into the boat so that the boat was now becoming full
 and he himself was in the back of the boat sleeping on the cushion and they awaking him said master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction
 and he came out of his sleep and gave strong orders to the wind and said to the sea peace be at rest and the wind went down and there was a great calm
 and he said to them why are you full of fear have you still no faith
 and their fear was great and they said one to another who then is this that even the wind and the sea do his orders
 and they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the gerasenes
 and when he had got out of the boat straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit
 he was living in the place of the dead and no man was able to keep him down no not with a chain
 because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him and no man was strong enough to make him quiet
 and all the time by day and by night in the place of the dead and in the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones
 and when he saw jesus from far off he went quickly to him and gave him worship
 and crying out with a loud voice he said what have i to do with you jesus son of the most high god in gods name do not be cruel to me
 for jesus had said to him come out of the man you unclean spirit
 and jesus said what is your name and he made answer my name is legion because there are a great number of us
 and he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country
 now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food
 and they said to him send us into the pigs so that we may go into them
 and he let them do it and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea about two thousand of them and they came to their death in the sea
 and their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country and people came to see what had taken place
 and they came to jesus and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated clothed and with full use of his senses and they were full of fear
 and those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits and of the fate of the pigs
 and they made a request to him to go out of their country
 and when he was getting into the boat the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him
 and he would not let him but said to him go to your house to your friends and give them news of the great things the lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you
 and he went on his way and made public in the country of decapolis what great things jesus had done for him and all men were full of wonder
 and when jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side a great number of people came to him and he was by the sea
 and one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name came and seeing him went down at his feet
 and made strong prayers to him saying my little daughter is near to death it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her so that she may be made well and have life
 and he went with him and a great number of people went after him and came round him
 and a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years
 and had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men and had given all she had and was no better but even worse
 when she had news of the things which jesus did went among the people coming after him and put her hand on his robe
 for she said if i may only put my hand on his robe i will be made well
 and straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well
 and straight away jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him and turning to the people he said who was touching my robe
 and his disciples said to him you see the people round you on every side and you say who was touching me
 and on his looking round to see her who had done this thing
 the woman shaking with fear conscious of what had been done to her came and falling on her face before him gave him a true account of everything
 and he said to her daughter your faith has made you well go in peace and be free from your disease
 and while he was still talking they came from the ruler of the synagogues house saying your daughter is dead why are you still troubling the master
 but jesus giving no attention to their words said to the ruler of the synagogue have no fear only have faith
 and he did not let anyone come with him but peter and james and john the brother of james
 and they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and he saw people running this way and that and weeping and crying loudly
 and when he had gone in he said to them why are you making such a noise and weeping the child is not dead but sleeping
 and they were laughing at him but he having sent them all out took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was
 and taking her by the hand he said to her talitha cumi which is my child i say to you get up
 and the young girl got up straight away and was walking about she being twelve years old and they were overcome with wonder
 and he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this and he said that some food was to be given to her
 and he went away from there and came into his country and his disciples went with him
 and when the sabbath day had come he was teaching in the synagogue and a number of people hearing him were surprised saying from where did this man get these things and what is the wisdom given to this man and what are these works of power done by his hands
 is not this the woodworker the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were bitter against him
 and jesus said to them a prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his relations and in his family
 and he was unable to do any work of power there but only to put his hands on one or two persons who were ill and make them well
 and he was greatly surprised because they had no faith and he went about the country places teaching
 and he gave orders to the twelve and sent them out two by two and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits
 and he said that they were to take nothing for their journey but a stick only no bread no bag no money in their pockets
 they were to go with common shoes on their feet and not to take two coats
 and he said to them wherever you go into a house make that your resting place till you go away
 and whatever place will not take you in and will not give ear to you when you go away put off the dust from your feet as a witness against them
 and they went out preaching the need for a change of heart in men
 and they sent out a number of evil spirits and put oil on a great number who were ill and made them well
 and king herod had news of him because his name was on the lips of all and he said john the baptist has come back from the dead and for this reason these powers are working in him
 but others said it is elijah and others said it is a prophet even like one of the prophets
 but herod when he had news of it said john whom i put to death has come back from the dead
 for herod himself had sent men out to take john and put him in prison because of herodias his brother philips wife whom he had taken for himself
 for john said to herod it is wrong for you to have your brothers wife
 and herodias was bitter against him desiring to put him to death but she was not able
 for herod was in fear of john being conscious that he was an upright and holy man and kept him safe and hearing him he was much troubled and he gave ear to him gladly
 and the chance came when herod on his birthday gave a feast to his lords and the high captains and the chief men of galilee
 and when the daughter of herodias herself came in and did a dance herod and those who were at table with him were pleased with her and the king said to the girl make a request for anything and i will give it you
 and he took an oath saying to her whatever is your desire i will give it to you even half of my kingdom
 and she went out and said to her mother what is my request to be and she said the head of john the baptist
 and she came in quickly to the king and said my desire is that you give me straight away on a plate the head of john the baptist
 and the king was very sad but because of his oaths and those who were with him at table he would not say no to her
 and straight away the king sent out one of his armed men and gave him an order to come back with the head and he went and took off johns head in prison
 and came back with the head on a plate and gave it to the girl and the girl gave it to her mother
 and when his disciples had news of it they came and took up his body and put it in its last resting place
 and the twelve came together to jesus and they gave him an account of all the things they had done and all they had been teaching
 and he said to them come away by yourselves to a quiet place and take a rest for a time because there were a great number coming and going and they had no time even for food
 and they went away in the boat to a waste place by themselves
 and the people saw them going and a number of them having knowledge who they were went running there together on foot from all the towns and got there before them
 and he got out and saw a great mass of people and he had pity on them because they were like sheep without a keeper and he gave them teaching about a number of things
 and at the end of the day his disciples came to him and said this place is waste land and it is late
 send them away so that they may go into the country and small towns round about and get some food for themselves
 but he said to them in answer give them food yourselves and they said to him are we to go and get bread for two hundred pence and give it to them
 and he said to them how much bread have you go and see and when they had seen they said five cakes of bread and two fishes
 and he made them all be seated in groups on the green grass
 and they were placed in groups by hundreds and by fifties
 and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing over them and when the cakes were broken he gave them to the disciples to put before the people and he made division of the two fishes among them all
 and they all took of the food and had enough
 and they took up twelve baskets full of the broken bits and of the fishes
 and those who took of the bread were five thousand men
 and straight away he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side to beth saida while he himself sent the people away
 and after he had sent them away he went up into a mountain for prayer
 and by evening the boat was in the middle of the sea and he by himself on the land
 and seeing that they had trouble in getting their boat through the water because the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea and he would have gone past them
 but they when they saw him walking on the sea took him for a spirit and gave a loud cry
 for they all saw him and were troubled but straight away he said to them take heart it is i have no fear
 and he went to them into the boat and the wind went down and they were full of wonder in themselves
 for it was not clear to them about the bread but their hearts were hard
 and when they had gone across they came to gennesaret and got their boat to land
 and when they had got out of the boat the people quickly had news of him
 and went running through all the country round about and took on their beds those who were ill to where it was said that he was
 and wherever he went into small towns or great towns or into the country they took those who were ill into the market places requesting him that they might put their hands even on the edge of his robe and all those who did so were made well
 and there came together to him the pharisees and certain of the scribes who had come from jerusalem
 and had seen that some of his disciples took their bread with unclean that is unwashed hands
 now the pharisees and all the jews do not take food without washing their hands with care keeping the old rule which has been handed down to them
 and when they come from the market place they take no food till their hands are washed and a number of other orders there are which have been handed down to them to keep  washings of cups and pots and brass vessels
 and the pharisees and the scribes put the question to him why do your disciples not keep the rules of the fathers but take their bread with unwashed hands
 and he said well did isaiah say of you you false ones these people give me honour with their lips but their heart is far from me
 but their worship is to no purpose while they give as their teaching the rules of men
 for turning away from the law of god you keep the rules of men
 and he said to them truly you put on one side the law of god so that you may keep the rules which have been handed down to you
 for moses said give honour to your father and mother and he who says evil of father or mother let him have the punishment of death
 but you say if a man says to his father or his mother that by which you might have had profit from me is corban that is to say given to god
 you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother
 making the word of god of no effect by your rule which you have given and a number of other such things you do
 and turning to the people again he said to them give ear to me all of you and let my words be clear to you
 there is nothing outside the man which going into him is able to make him unclean but the things which come out of the man are those which make the man unclean
   
 and when he had gone into the house away from all the people his disciples put questions to him about the saying
 and he said to them have even you so little wisdom do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside is not able to make him unclean
 because it goes not into the heart but into the stomach and goes out with the waste he said this making all food clean
 and he said that which comes out of the man that makes the man unclean
 because from inside from the heart of men come evil thoughts and unclean pleasures
 the taking of goods and of life broken faith between husband and wife the desire of wealth wrongdoing deceit sins of the flesh an evil eye angry words pride foolish acts
 all these evil things come from inside and make the man unclean
 and he went away from there to the country of tyre and sidon and he went into a house desiring that no man might have knowledge of it and he was not able to keep it secret
 but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit having had news of him came straight away and went down at his feet
 now the woman was a greek a syro phoenician by birth and she made a request to him that he would send the evil spirit out of her daughter
 and he said to her let the children first have their food for it is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs
 but she said to him in answer yes lord even the dogs under the table take the bits dropped by the children
 and he said to her for this saying go your way the evil spirit has gone out of your daughter
 and she went away to her house and saw the child on the bed and the evil spirit gone out
 and again he went out from tyre and came through sidon to the sea of galilee through the country of decapolis
 and they came to him with one who had no power of hearing and had trouble in talking and they made a request to him to put his hands on him
 and he took him on one side from the people privately and put his fingers into his ears and he put water from his mouth on the mans tongue with his finger
 and looking up to heaven he took a deep breath and said to him ephphatha that is be open
 and his ears became open and the band of his tongue was made loose and his words became clear
 and he gave them orders not to give news of it to anyone but the more he made this request so much the more they made it public
 and they were overcome with wonder saying he has done all things well he even gives back the power of hearing and the power of talking to those who have been without them
 in those days again when there was a great mass of people and they had no food he made his disciples come to him and said to them
 i have pity for these people because they have been with me now three days and have no food
 if i send them away to their houses with no food they will be overcome by weariness on the way and some of them have come from far
 and his disciples said in answer how will it be possible to get enough bread for these men here in a waste place
 and he put the question how much bread have you and they said seven cakes
 and he made the people be seated on the earth and he took the seven cakes and having given praise he gave the broken bread to his disciples to put before them and they put it before the people
 and they had some small fishes and blessing them he had them put before the people in the same way
 and they took the food and had enough and they took up seven baskets full of the broken bits
 and there were about four thousand people and he sent them away
 and he got into the boat with his disciples straight away and came into the country of dalmanutha
 and the pharisees came out and put questions to him requesting from him a sign from heaven testing him
 and he was very sad in spirit and said why is this generation looking for a sign truly i say to you no sign will be given to this generation
 and he went away from them and again got into the boat and went across to the other side
 and they had taken no thought to get bread and they had only one cake of bread with them in the boat
 and he said to them take care to be on the watch against the leaven of the pharisees and the leaven of herod
 and they said to one another we have no bread
 and jesus hearing it said to them why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread do you still not see and is it still not clear to you are your hearts so hard
 having eyes do you not see and having ears have you no hearing and have you no memory
 when i made a division of the five cakes of bread among the five thousand what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up they said to him twelve
 and when the seven among the four thousand what number of baskets full of broken bits did you take up and they said to him seven
 and he said to them is it still not clear to you
 and they came to beth saida and they took a blind man to him requesting him to put his hands on him
 and he took the blind man by the hand and went with him out of the town and when he had put water from his mouth on his eyes and put his hands on him he said do you see anything
 and looking up he said i see men i see them like trees walking
 then again he put his hands on his eyes and looking hard he was able to see and saw all things clearly
 and he sent him away to his house saying do not even go into the town
 and jesus went out with his disciples into the little towns round caesarea philippi and on the way he put a question to his disciples saying who do men say that i am
 and they made answer john the baptist and others elijah but others one of the prophets
 and he said to them but who do you say i am peter said in answer you are the christ
 and he put them under orders not to say this of him to anyone
 and teaching them he said that the son of man would have to undergo much and be hated by those in authority and the chief priests and the scribes and be put to death and after three days come back from the dead
 and he said this openly and peter took him and was protesting
 but he turning about and seeing his disciples said sharply to peter get out of my way satan for your mind is not on the things of god but on the things of men
 and turning to the mass of people with his disciples he said to them if any man has the desire to come after me let him give up all other desires and take up his cross and come after me
 whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him and whoever gives up his life because of me and the good news will keep it
 what profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life
 and what would a man give in exchange for his life
 whoever has a feeling of shame because of me and my words in this false and evil generation the son of man will have a feeling of shame because of him when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
 and he said to them truly i say to you there are some here who will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of god come with power
 and after six days jesus took with him peter and james and john and made them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves and he was changed in form before them
 and his clothing became shining very white as no cleaner on earth would make it
 and there came before them elijah with moses and they were talking with jesus
 and peter said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tents one for you one for moses and one for elijah
 because he was not certain what to say for they were in great fear
 and a cloud came over them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my dearly loved son give ear to him
 and suddenly looking round about they saw no one any longer but jesus only with themselves
 and while they were coming down from the mountain he gave them orders not to give word to any man of the things they had seen till the son of man had come back from the dead
 and they kept the saying questioning among themselves what the coming back from the dead might be
 and they put a question to him saying why do the scribes say that elijah has to come first
 and he said to them truly elijah does come first and puts all things in order and how is it said in the writings that the son of man will go through much sorrow and be made as nothing
 but i say to you that elijah has come and they have done to him whatever they were pleased to do even as the writings say about him
 and when they came to the disciples they saw a great mass of people about them and scribes questioning them
 and straight away all the people when they saw him were full of wonder and running to him gave him worship
 and he said what are you questioning them about
 and one of the number said to him in answer master i came to you with my son who has in him a spirit which takes away his power of talking
 and wherever it takes him it puts him down violently streaming at the lips and twisted with pain and his strength goes from him and i made a request to your disciples to send it out and they were not able
 and he said to them in answer o generation without faith how long will i have to be with you how long will i put up with you let him come to me
 and they took him to him and when he saw him the spirit in him straight away became violent and he went down on the earth rolling about and streaming at the lips
 and jesus questioning the father said how long has he been like this and he said from a child
 and frequently it has sent him into the fire and into the water for his destruction but if you are able to do anything have pity on us and give us help
 and jesus said to him if you are able  all things are possible to him who has faith
 straight away the father of the child gave a cry saying i have faith make my feeble faith stronger
 and when jesus saw that the people came running together he gave orders to the unclean spirit saying to him you spirit who are the cause of his loss of voice and hearing i say to you come out of him and never again go into him
 and after crying out and shaking him violently it came out and the child became like one dead so that most of them said he is dead
 but jesus took him by the hand lifting him up and he got up
 and when he had gone into the house his disciples said to him privately why were we unable to send it out
 and he said to them nothing will make this sort come out but prayer
 and they went out from there through galilee and it was his desire that no man might have knowledge of it
 for he was giving his disciples teaching and saying to them the son of man is given up into the hands of men and they will put him to death and when he is dead after three days he will come back from the dead
 but the saying was not clear to them and they were in fear of questioning him about it
 and they came to capernaum and when he was in the house he put the question to them what were you talking about on the way
 but they said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves on the way about who was the greatest
 and seating himself he made the twelve come to him and he said to them if any man has the desire to be first he will be last of all and servant of all
 and he took a little child and put him in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them
 whoever will give honour to one such little child in my name gives honour to me and whoever gives honour to me gives honour not to me but to him who sent me
 john said to him master we saw one driving out evil spirits in your name and we said that he might not because he is not one of us
 but jesus said say not so for there is no man who will do a great work in my name and be able at the same time to say evil of me
 he who is not against us is for us
 whoever gives you a cup of water because you are christs truly i say to you he will in no way be without his reward
 and whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea
 and if your hand is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off it is better for you to go into life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell into the eternal fire
   
 and if your foot is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off it is better for you to go into life with one foot than to have two feet and go into hell
   
 and if your eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out it is better for you to go into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to go into hell
 where their worm is ever living and the fire is not put out
 everyone will be salted with fire
 salt is good but if the taste goes from it how will you make it salt again have salt in yourselves and be at peace one with another
 the book of the generations of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham
 the son of abraham was isaac and the son of isaac was jacob and the sons of jacob were judah and his brothers
 and the sons of judah were perez and zerah by tamar and the son of perez was hezron and the son of hezron was ram
 and the son of ram was amminadab and the son of amminadab was nahshon and the son of nahshon was salmon
 and the son of salmon by rahab was boaz and the son of boaz by ruth was obed and the son of obed was jesse
 and the son of jesse was david the king and the son of david was solomon by her who had been the wife of uriah
 and the son of solomon was rehoboam and the son of rehoboam was abijah and the son of abijah was asa
 and the son of asa was jehoshaphat and the son of jehoshaphat was joram and the son of joram was uzziah
 and the son of uzziah was jotham and the son of jotham was ahaz and the son of ahaz was hezekiah
 and the son of hezekiah was manasseh and the son of manasseh was amon and the son of amon was josiah
 and the sons of josiah were jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the taking away to babylon
 and after the taking away to babylon jechoniah had a son shealtiel and shealtiel had zerubbabel
 and zerubbabel had abiud and abiud had eliakim and eliakim had azor
 and azor had zadok and zadok had achim and achim had eliud
 and eliud had eleazar and eleazar had matthan and matthan had jacob
 and the son of jacob was joseph the husband of mary who gave birth to jesus whose name is christ
 so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david to the taking away to babylon fourteen generations and from the taking away to babylon to the coming of christ fourteen generations
 now the birth of jesus christ was in this way when his mother mary was going to be married to joseph before they came together the discovery was made that she was with child by the holy spirit
 and joseph her husband being an upright man and not desiring to make her a public example had a mind to put her away privately
 but when he was giving thought to these things an angel of the lord came to him in a dream saying joseph son of david have no fear of taking mary as your wife because that which is in her body is of the holy spirit
 and she will give birth to a son and you will give him the name jesus for he will give his people salvation from their sins
 now all this took place so that the word of the lord by the prophet might come true
 see the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will give him the name immanuel that is god with us
 and joseph did as the angel of the lord had said to him and took her as his wife
 and he had no connection with her till she had given birth to a son and he gave him the name jesus
 and he got together his twelve disciples and gave them the power of driving out unclean spirits and of making well all sorts of disease and pain
 now the names of the twelve are these the first simon who is named peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother
 philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax farmer james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus
 simon the zealot and judas iscariot who was false to him
 these twelve jesus sent out and gave them orders saying do not go among the gentiles or into any town of samaria
 but go to the wandering sheep of the house of israel
 and on your way say the kingdom of heaven is near
 make well those who are ill give life to the dead make lepers clean send evil spirits out of men freely it has been given to you freely give
 take no gold or silver or copper in your pockets
 take no bag for your journey and do not take two coats or shoes or a stick for the workman has a right to his food
 and into whatever town or small place you go make search there for someone who is respected and make his house your resting place till you go away
 and when you go in say may peace be on this house
 and if the house is good enough let your peace come on it but if not let your peace come back to you
 and whoever will not take you in or give ear to your words when you go out from that house or that town put off its dust from your feet
 truly i say to you it will be better for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of gods judging than for that town
 see i send you out as sheep among wolves be then as wise as snakes and as gentle as doves
 but be on the watch against men for they will give you up to the sanhedrins and in their synagogues they will give you blows
 and you will come before rulers and kings because of me for a witness to them and to the gentiles
 but when you are given up into their hands do not be troubled about what to say or how to say it for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you
 because it is not you who say the words but the spirit of your father in you
 and brother will give up brother to death and the father his child and children will go against their fathers and mothers and put them to death
 and you will be hated by all men because of my name but he who is strong to the end will have salvation
 but when they are cruel to you in one town go in flight to another for truly i say to you you will not have gone through the towns of israel before the son of man comes
 a disciple is not greater than his master or a servant than his lord
 it is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have given the name beelzebub to the master of the house how much more to those of his house 
 have then no fear of them because nothing is covered which will not come to light or secret which will not be made clear
 what i say to you in the dark say in the light and what comes to your ear secretly say publicly from the house tops
 and have no fear of those who put to death the body but are not able to put to death the soul but have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell
 are not sparrows two a farthing and not one of them comes to an end without your father
 but the hairs of your head are all numbered
 then have no fear you are of more value than a flock of sparrows
 to everyone then who gives witness to me before men i will give witness before my father in heaven
 but if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me i will say that i have no knowledge of him before my father in heaven
 do not have the thought that i have come to send peace on the earth i came not to send peace but a sword
 for i have come to put a man against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
 and a man will be hated by those of his house
 he who has more love for his father or mother than for me is not good enough for me he who has more love for son or daughter than for me is not good enough for me
 and he who does not take his cross and come after me is not good enough for me
 he who has the desire to keep his life will have it taken from him and he who gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him
 he who gives honour to you gives honour to me and he who gives honour to me gives honour to him who sent me
 he who gives honour to a prophet in the name of a prophet will be given a prophets reward and he who gives honour to an upright man in the name of an upright man will be given an upright mans reward
 and whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple truly i say to you he will not go without his reward
 and it came about that when jesus had come to the end of giving these orders to his twelve disciples he went away from there teaching and preaching in their towns
 now when john had news in prison of the works of the christ he sent his disciples
 to say to him are you he who is to come or are we waiting for another
 and jesus answering said to them go and give news to john of the things which you are seeing and hearing
 the blind see those who were not able to are walking lepers are made clean those who were without hearing now have their ears open the dead come to life again and the poor have the good news given to them
 and a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me
 and when they were going away jesus talking of john said to all the people what went you out into the waste land to see a tall stem moving in the wind
 but what went you out to see a man delicately clothed those who have fair robes are in kings houses
 but why did you go out to see a prophet yes i say to you and more than a prophet
 this is he of whom it has been said see i send my servant before your face who will make ready your way before you
 truly i say to you among the sons of women there has not been a greater than john the baptist but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
 and from the days of john the baptist till now the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in and men of force take it
 for all the prophets and the law were in force till john
 and if you are able to see it this is elijah who was to come
 he who has ears let him give ear
 but what comparison may i make of this generation it is like children seated in the market places crying out to one another
 we made music for you and you did not take part in the dance we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief
 for john came taking no food or drink and they say he has an evil spirit
 the son of man has come feasting and they say see a lover of food and wine a friend of tax farmers and sinners  and wisdom is judged to be right by her works
 then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done because they had not been turned from their sins
 unhappy are you chorazin  unhappy are you beth saida  for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on their heads
 but i say to you it will be better for tyre and sidon in the day of judging than for you
 and you capernaum were you not to be lifted up to heaven you will go down into hell for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in sodom it would have been here to this day
 but i say to you that it will be better for the land of sodom in the day of judging than for you
 at that time jesus made answer and said i give praise to you o father lord of heaven and earth because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning and have made them clear to little children
 yes father for so it was pleasing in your eyes
 all things have been given to me by my father and no one has knowledge of the son but the father and no one has knowledge of the father but the son and he to whom the son will make it clear
 come to me all you who are troubled and weighted down with care and i will give you rest
 take my yoke on you and become like me for i am gentle and without pride and you will have rest for your souls
 for my yoke is good and the weight i take up is not hard
 at that time jesus went through the fields on the sabbath day and his disciples being in need of food were taking the heads of grain
 but the pharisees when they saw it said to him see your disciples do that which it is not right to do on the sabbath
 but he said to them have you no knowledge of what david did when he had need of food and those who were with him
 how he went into the house of god and took for food the holy bread which it was not right for him or for those who were with him to take but only for the priests
 or is it not said in the law how the sabbath is broken by the priests in the temple and they do no wrong
 but i say to you that a greater thing than the temple is here
 but if these words had been in your minds my desire is for mercy and not for offerings you would not have been judging those who have done no wrong
 for the son of man is lord of the sabbath
 and he went from there into their synagogue
 and there was a man with a dead hand and they put a question to him saying is it right to make a man well on the sabbath day so that they might have something against him
 and he said to them which of you having a sheep if it gets into a hole on the sabbath day will not put out a helping hand and get it back
 of how much more value is a man than a sheep  for this reason it is right to do good on the sabbath day
 then said he to the man put out your hand and he put it out and it was made as well as the other
 but the pharisees went out and made designs against him how they might put him to death
 and jesus having knowledge of this went away from there and a great number went after him and he made them all well
 ordering them not to give people word of him
 so that what was said by isaiah the prophet might come true
 see my servant the man of my selection my loved one in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit on him and he will make my decision clear to the gentiles
 his coming will not be with fighting or loud cries and his voice will not be lifted up in the streets
 the crushed stem will not be broken by him and the feebly burning light will he not put out till he has made righteousness overcome all
 and in his name will the gentiles put their hope
 then they took to him one with an evil spirit who was blind and had no power of talking and he made him well so that he had the power of talking and seeing
 and all the people were surprised and said is not this the son of david
 but the pharisees hearing of it said this man only sends evil spirits out of men by beelzebub the ruler of evil spirits
 and having knowledge of their thoughts he said to them every kingdom having division in itself is made waste and every town or house having division in itself will come to destruction
 and if satan sends out satan he makes war against himself how then will he keep his kingdom
 and if i by beelzebub send evil spirits out of men by whom do your sons send them out so let them be your judges
 but if i by the spirit of god send out evil spirits then is the kingdom of god come on you
 or how may one go into a strong mans house and take his goods if he does not first put cords round the strong man and then he may take his goods
 whoever is not with me is against me and he who does not take part with me in getting people together is driving them away
 so i say to you every sin and every evil word against god will have forgiveness but for evil words against the spirit there will be no forgiveness
 and whoever says a word against the son of man will have forgiveness but whoever says a word against the holy spirit will not have forgiveness in this life or in that which is to come
 make the tree good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad for by its fruit you will get knowledge of the tree
 you offspring of snakes how are you being evil able to say good things because out of the hearts store come the words of the mouth
 the good man out of his good store gives good things and the evil man out of his evil store gives evil things
 and i say to you that in the day when they are judged men will have to give an account of every foolish word they have said
 for by your words will your righteousness be seen and by your words you will be judged
 then some of the scribes and pharisees hearing this said to him master we are looking for a sign from you
 but he answering said to them an evil and false generation is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonah
 for as jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish so will the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
 the men of nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation because they were turned from their sins at the preaching of jonah and now a greater than jonah is here
 the queen of the south will come up in the day of judging and give her decision against this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of solomon and now a greater than solomon is here
 but the unclean spirit when he is gone out of a man goes through dry places looking for rest and getting it not
 then he says i will go back into my house from which i came out and when he comes he sees that there is no one in it but that it has been made fair and clean
 then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits worse than himself and they go in and make it their living place and the last condition of that man is worse than the first even so will it be with this evil generation
 while he was still talking to the people his mother and his brothers came desiring to have talk with him
 and one said to him see your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to have talk with you
 but he in answer said to him who gave the news who is my mother and who are my brothers
 and he put out his hand to his disciples and said see my mother and my brothers 
 for whoever does the pleasure of my father in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother
 on that day jesus went out of the house and was seated by the seaside
 and great numbers of people came together to him so that he got into a boat and the people took up their position by the sea
 and he gave them teaching in the form of a story saying a man went out to put seed in the earth
 and while he did so some seeds were dropped by the wayside and the birds came and took them for food
 and some of the seed went among the stones where it had not much earth and straight away it came up because the earth was not deep
 and when the sun was high it was burned and because it had no root it became dry and dead
 and some seeds went among thorns and the thorns came up and they had no room for growth
 and some falling on good earth gave fruit some a hundred some sixty some thirty times as much
 he who has ears let him give ear
 and the disciples came and said to him why do you say things to them in the form of stories
 and he said to them in answer to you is given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given
 because whoever has to him will be given and he will have more but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
 for this reason i put things into the form of stories because they see without seeing and give ear without hearing and the sense is not clear to them
 and for them the words of isaiah have come true though you give ear you will not get knowledge and seeing you will see but the sense will not be clear to you
 for the heart of this people has become fat and their ears are slow in hearing and their eyes are shut for fear that they might see with their eyes and give hearing with their ears and become wise in their hearts and be turned again to me so that i might make them well
 but a blessing be on your eyes because they see and on your ears because they are open
 for truly i say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see and saw them not and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears and they had it not
 give ear then to the story of the man who put the seed in the earth
 when the word of the kingdom comes to anyone and the sense of it is not clear to him then the evil one comes and quickly takes away that which was put in his heart he is the seed dropped by the wayside
 and that which went on the stones this is he who hearing the word straight away takes it with joy
 but having no root in himself he goes on for a time and when trouble comes or pain because of the word he quickly becomes full of doubts
 and that which was dropped among the thorns this is he who has the word and the cares of this life and the deceits of wealth put a stop to the growth of the word and it gives no fruit
 and the seed which was put in good earth this is he who gives ear to the word and gets the sense of it who gives fruit some a hundred some sixty some thirty times as much
 and he gave them another story saying the kingdom of heaven is like a man who put good seed in his field
 but while men were sleeping one who had hate for him came and put evil seeds among the grain and went away
 but when the green stem came up and gave fruit the evil plants were seen at the same time
 and the servants of the master of the house came and said to him sir did you not put good seed in your field how then has it evil plants
 and he said someone has done this in hate and the servants say to him is it your pleasure that we go and take them up
 but he says no for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants you may be rooting up the grain with them
 let them come up together till the getting in of the grain and then i will say to the workers take up first the evil plants and put them together for burning but put the grain into my store house
 he put another story before them saying the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his field
 which is smaller than all seeds but when it has come up it is greater than the plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of heaven come and make their resting places in its branches
 another story he gave to them the kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and put in three measures of meal till it was all leavened
 all these things jesus said to the people in the form of stories and without a story he said nothing to them
 that it might come true which was said by the prophet opening my mouth i will give out stories i will give knowledge of things kept secret from before all time
 then he went away from the people and went into the house and his disciples came to him saying make clear to us the story of the evil plants in the field
 and he made answer and said he who puts the good seed in the earth is the son of man
 and the field is the world and the good seed is the sons of the kingdom and the evil seeds are the sons of the evil one
 and he who put them in the earth is satan and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world and those who get it in are the angels
 as then the evil plants are got together and burned with fire so will it be in the end of the world
 the son of man will send out his angels and they will take out of his kingdom everything which is a cause of error and all those who do wrong
 and will put them into the fire there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 then will the upright be shining as the sun in the kingdom of their father he who has ears let him give ear
 the kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field which a man came across and put back again and in his joy he goes and gives all he has to get that field
 again the kingdom of heaven is like a trader searching for beautiful jewels
 and having come across one jewel of great price he went and gave all he had in exchange for it
 again the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was put into the sea and took in every sort of fish
 when it was full they took it up on the sands and seated there they put the good into vessels but the bad they put away
 so will it be in the end of the world the angels will come and take out the bad from the good
 and will put them into the fire there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 are all these things now clear to you they say to him yes
 and he said to them for this reason every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who gives out from his store things new and old
 and when jesus had come to the end of these stories he went away from there
 and coming into his country he gave them teaching in their synagogue so that they were greatly surprised and said where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power
 is not this the woodworkers son is not his mother named mary and his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas
 and his sisters are they not all with us from where then has he all these things
 and they were bitter against him but jesus said to them a prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family
 and the works of power which he did there were small in number because they had no faith
 at that time news of jesus came to herod the king
 and he said to his servants this is john the baptist he has come back from the dead and so these powers are working in him
 for herod had taken john and put him in prison because of herodias his brother philips wife
 because john had said to him it is not right for you to have her
 and he would have put him to death but for his fear of the people because in their eyes john was a prophet
 but when herods birthday came the daughter of herodias was dancing before them and herod was pleased with her
 so he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for
 and she at her mothers suggestion said give me here on a plate the head of john the baptist
 and the king was sad but because of his oaths and because of his guests he gave the order for it to be given to her
 and he sent and had johns head cut off in the prison
 and his head was put on a plate and given to the girl and she took it to her mother
 and his disciples came and took up his body and put it in the earth and they went and gave jesus news of what had taken place
 now when it came to the ears of jesus he went away from there in a boat to a waste place by himself and the people hearing of it went after him on foot from the towns
 and he came out and saw a great number of people and he had pity on them and made well those of them who were ill
 and when evening had come the disciples came to him saying this place is waste land and the time is now past send the people away so that they may go into the towns and get themselves food
 but jesus said to them there is no need for them to go away give them food yourselves
 and they say to him we have here but five cakes of bread and two fishes
 and he said give them to me
 and he gave orders for the people to be seated on the grass and he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he said words of blessing and made division of the food and gave it to the disciples and the disciples gave it to the people
 and they all took of the food and had enough and they took up twelve baskets full of broken bits which were not used
 and those who had food were about five thousand men in addition to women and children
 and straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side till he had sent the people away
 and after he had sent the people away he went up into the mountain by himself for prayer and when evening was come he was there by himself
 but the boat was now in the middle of the sea and was troubled by the waves for the wind was against them
 and in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea
 and when they saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they gave cries of fear
 but straight away jesus said to them take heart it is i have no fear
 and peter answering said to him lord if it is you give me the order to come to you on the water
 and he said come and peter got out of the boat and walking on the water went to jesus
 but when he saw the wind he was in fear and starting to go down he gave a cry saying help lord
 and straight away jesus put out his hand and took a grip of him and said to him o man of little faith why were you in doubt
 and when they had got into the boat the wind went down
 and those who were in the boat gave him worship saying truly you are the son of god
 and when they had gone across they came to land at gennesaret
 and when the men of that place had news of him they sent into all the country round about and took to him all who were ill
 with the request that they might only put their hands on the edge of his robe and all those who did so were made well
 then there came to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes saying
 why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers for they take food with unwashed hands
 and in answer he said to them why do you yourselves go against the word of god on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you
 for god said give honour to your father and mother and he who says evil of father or mother will be put to death
 but you say if a man says to his father or his mother that by which you might have had profit from me is given to god
 there is no need for him to give honour to his father and you have made the word of god without effect because of your teaching
 you false ones well did isaiah say of you
 these people give me honour with their lips but their heart is far from me
 but their worship is to no purpose while they give as their teaching the rules of men
 and he got the people together and said to them give ear and let my words be clear to you
 not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean but that which comes out of the mouth
 then the disciples came and said to him did you see that the pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears
 but he said in answer every plant which my father in heaven has not put in the earth will be taken up by the roots
 let them be they are blind guides and if a blind man is guiding a blind man the two will go falling into a hole together
 then peter said to him make the story clear to us
 and he said are you like them still without wisdom
 do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach and is sent out as waste
 but the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart and they make a man unclean
 for out of the heart come evil thoughts the taking of life broken faith between the married unclean desires of the flesh taking of property false witness bitter words
 these are the things which make a man unclean but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean
 and jesus went away from there into the country of tyre and sidon
 and a woman of canaan came out from those parts crying and saying have pity on me o lord son of david my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit
 but he gave her no answer and his disciples came and said to him send her away for she is crying after us
 but he made answer and said i was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of israel
 but she came and gave him worship saying help lord
 and he made answer and said it is not right to take the childrens bread and give it to the dogs
 but she said yes lord but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters table
 then jesus answering said to her o woman great is your faith let your desire be done and her daughter was made well from that hour
 and jesus went from there and came to the sea of galilee and he went up into the mountain and took his seat there
 and there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body or blind or without voice or wounded or ill in any way and a number of others they put them down at his feet and he made them well
 so that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking the feeble were made strong those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking and the blind were able to see and they gave glory to the god of israel
 and jesus got his disciples together and said i have pity for the people because they have now been with me three days and have no food and i will not send them away without food or they will have no strength for the journey
 and the disciples say to him how may we get enough bread in a waste place to give food to such a number of people
 and jesus says to them how much bread have you and they said seven cakes and some small fishes
 then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth
 and he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes and having given praise he gave the broken bread to the disciples and the disciples gave it to the people
 and they all took food and had enough and they took up of the broken bits seven baskets full
 and there were four thousand men who took food together with women and children
 and when he had sent the people away he got into the boat and came into the country of magadan
 and the pharisees and sadducees came and testing him made a request to him to give them a sign from heaven
 but in answer he said to them at nightfall you say the weather will be good for the sky is red
 and in the morning the weather will be bad today for the sky is red and angry you are able to see the face of heaven but not the signs of the times
 an evil and false generation is searching after a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of jonah and he went away from them
 and when the disciples came to the other side they had not taken thought to get bread
 and jesus said to them take care to have nothing to do with the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees
 and they were reasoning among themselves saying we took no bread
 and jesus seeing it said o you of little faith why are you reasoning among yourselves because you have no bread
 do you still not see or keep in mind the five cakes of bread of the five thousand and the number of baskets you took up
 or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand and the number of baskets you took up
 how is it that you do not see that i was not talking to you about bread but about keeping away from the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees
 then they saw that it was not the leaven of bread which he had in mind but the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees
 now when jesus had come into the parts of caesarea philippi he said questioning his disciples who do men say that the son of man is
 and they said some say john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
 he says to them but who do you say that i am
 and simon peter made answer and said you are the christ the son of the living god
 and jesus made answer and said to him a blessing on you simon bar jonah because this knowledge has not come to you from flesh and blood but from my father in heaven
 and i say to you that you are peter and on this rock will my church be based and the doors of hell will not overcome it
 i will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever is fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven
 then he gave orders to the disciples to give no man word that he was the christ
 from that time jesus went on to make clear to his disciples how he would have to go up to jerusalem and undergo much at the hands of those in authority and the chief priests and scribes and be put to death and the third day come again from the dead
 and peter protesting said to him be it far from you lord it is impossible that this will come about
 but he turning to peter said get out of my way satan you are a danger to me because your mind is not on the things of god but on the things of men
 then jesus said to his disciples if any man would come after me let him give up all and take up his cross and come after me
 because whoever has a desire to keep his life safe will have it taken from him but whoever gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him
 for what profit has a man if he gets all the world with the loss of his life or what will a man give in exchange for his life
 for the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he will give to every man the reward of his works
 truly i say to you there are some of those here who will not have a taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
 and after six days jesus takes with him peter and james and john his brother and makes them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves
 and he was changed in form before them and his face was shining like the sun and his clothing became white as light
 and moses and elijah came before their eyes talking with him
 and peter made answer and said to jesus lord it is good for us to be here if you will let me i will make here three tents one for you and one for moses and one for elijah
 while he was still talking a bright cloud came over them and a voice out of the cloud saying this is my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased give ear to him
 and at these words the disciples went down on their faces in great fear
 and jesus came and put his hand on them and said get up and have no fear
 and lifting up their eyes they saw no one but jesus only
 and when they were coming down from the mountain jesus gave them orders saying let no man have word of what you have seen till the son of man has come again from the dead
 and his disciples questioning him said why then do the scribes say that elijah has to come first
 and in answer he said elijah truly has to come and put all things right
 but i say to you that elijah has come and they had no knowledge of him but did to him whatever they were pleased to do the same will the son of man undergo at their hands
 then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of john the baptist
 and when they came to the people a man went down on his knees to him saying
 lord have mercy on my son for he is off his head and is in great pain and frequently he goes falling into the fire and frequently into the water
 and i took him to your disciples and they were not able to make him well
 and jesus answering said o false and foolish generation how long will i be with you how long will i put up with you let him come here to me
 and jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit and it went out of him and the boy was made well from that hour
 then the disciples came to jesus privately and said why were we not able to send it out
 and he says to them because of your little faith for truly i say to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you will say to this mountain be moved from this place to that and it will be moved and nothing will be impossible to you
   
 and while they were going about in galilee jesus said to them the son of man will be given up into the hands of men
 and they will put him to death and the third day he will come again from the dead and they were very sad
 and when they had come to capernaum those who took the temple tax came to peter and said does not your master make payment of the temple tax
 he says yes and when he came into the house jesus said to him what is your opinion simon from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax from their sons or from other people
 and when he said from other people jesus said to him then are the sons free
 but so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them go to the sea and let down a hook and take the first fish which comes up and in his mouth you will see a bit of money take that and give it to them for me and you
 in that hour the disciples came to jesus saying who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
 and he took a little child and put him in the middle of them
 and said truly i say to you if you do not have a change of heart and become like little children you will not go into the kingdom of heaven
 whoever then will make himself as low as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
 and whoever gives honour to one such little child in my name gives honour to me
 but whoever is a cause of trouble to one of these little ones who have faith in me it would be better for him to have a great stone fixed to his neck and to come to his end in the deep sea
 a curse is on the earth because of trouble  for it is necessary for trouble to come but unhappy is that man through whom the trouble comes
 and if your hand or your foot is a cause of trouble let it be cut off and put it away from you it is better for you to go into life with the loss of a hand or a foot than having two hands or two feet to go into the eternal fire
 and if your eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out and put it away from you it is better for you to go into life with one eye than having two eyes to go into the hell of fire
 let it not seem to you that one of these little ones is of no value for i say to you that in heaven their angels see at all times the face of my father in heaven
   
 what would you say now if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone wandering away will he not let the ninety nine be and go to the mountains in search of the wandering one
 and if he comes across it truly i say to you he has more joy over it than over the ninety nine which have not gone out of the way
 even so it is not the pleasure of your father in heaven for one of these little ones to come to destruction
 and if your brother does wrong to you go make clear to him his error between you and him in private if he gives ear to you you have got your brother back again
 but if he will not give ear to you take with you one or two more that by the lips of two or three witnesses every word may be made certain
 and if he will not give ear to them let it come to the hearing of the church and if he will not give ear to the church let him be to you as a gentile and a tax farmer
 truly i say to you whatever things are fixed by you on earth will be fixed in heaven and whatever you make free on earth will be made free in heaven
 again i say to you that if two of you are in agreement on earth about anything for which they will make a request it will be done for them by my father in heaven
 for where two or three are come together in my name there am i among them
 then peter came and said to him lord what number of times may my brother do wrong against me and i give him forgiveness till seven times
 jesus says to him i say not to you till seven times but till seventy times seven
 for this reason the kingdom of heaven is like a king who went over his accounts with his servants
 and at the start one came to him who was in his debt for ten thousand talents
 and because he was not able to make payment his lord gave orders for him and his wife and his sons and daughters and all he had to be given for money and payment to be made
 so the servant went down on his face and gave him worship saying lord give me time to make payment and i will give you all
 and the lord of that servant being moved with pity let him go and made him free of the debt
 but that servant went out and meeting one of the other servants who was in debt to him for one hundred pence he took him by the throat saying make payment of your debt
 so that servant went down on his face requesting him and saying give me time and i will make payment to you
 and he would not but went and put him into prison till he had made payment of the debt
 so when the other servants saw what was done they were very sad and came and gave word to their lord of what had been done
 then his lord sent for him and said you evil servant i made you free of all that debt because of your request to me
 was it not right for you to have mercy on the other servant even as i had mercy on you
 and his lord was very angry and put him in the hands of those who would give him punishment till he made payment of all the debt
 so will my father in heaven do to you if you do not everyone from your hearts give forgiveness to his brother
 and it came about that after saying these words jesus went away from galilee and came into the parts of judaea on the other side of jordan
 and a great number went after him and he made them well there
 and certain pharisees came to him testing him and saying is it right for a man to put away his wife for every cause
 and he said in answer have you not seen in the writings that he who made them at the first made them male and female and said
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh
 so that they are no longer two but one flesh then let not that which has been joined by god be parted by man
 they say to him why then did moses give orders that a husband might give her a statement in writing and be free from her
 he says to them moses because of your hard hearts let you put away your wives but it has not been so from the first
 and i say to you whoever puts away his wife for any other cause than the loss of her virtue and takes another is a false husband and he who takes her as his wife when she is put away is no true husband to her
 the disciples say to him if this is the position of a man in relation to his wife it is better not to be married
 but he said to them not all men are able to take in this saying but only those to whom it is given
 for there are men who from birth were without sex and there are some who were made so by men and there are others who have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven he who is able to take it let him take it
 then some people took little children to him so that he might put his hands on them in blessing and the disciples said sharp words to them
 but jesus said let the little ones come to me and do not keep them away for of such is the kingdom of heaven
 and he put his hands on them and went away
 and one came to him and said master what good thing have i to do so that i may have eternal life
 and he said to him why are you questioning me about what is good one there is who is good but if you have a desire to go into life keep the rules of the law
 he says to him which and jesus said do not put anyone to death do not be untrue in married life do not take what is not yours do not give false witness
 give honour to your father and your mother and have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 the young man says to him all these things have i done what more is there
 jesus said to him if you have a desire to be complete go get money for your property and give it to the poor and you will have wealth in heaven and come after me
 but hearing these words the young man went away sorrowing for he had much property
 and jesus said to his disciples truly i say to you it is hard for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of heaven
 and again i say to you it is simpler for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of god
 and the disciples hearing this were greatly surprised saying who then may have salvation
 and jesus looking at them said with men this is not possible but with god all things are possible
 then peter said to him see we have given up everything and have come after you what then will we have
 and jesus said to them truly i say to you that in the time when all things are made new and the son of man is seated in his glory you who have come after me will be seated on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of israel
 and everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or child or land for my name will be given a hundred times as much and have eternal life
 but a great number who are first will be last and some who are last will be first
 now when the birth of jesus took place in beth lehem of judaea in the days of herod the king there came wise men from the east to jerusalem
 saying where is the king of the jews whose birth has now taken place we have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship
 and when it came to the ears of herod the king he was troubled and all jerusalem with him
 and he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people questioning them as to where the birth place of the christ would be
 and they said to him in beth lehem of judaea for so it is said in the writings of the prophet
 you beth lehem in the land of judah are not the least among the chiefs of judah out of you will come a ruler who will be the keeper of my people israel
 then herod sent for the wise men privately and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen
 and he sent them to beth lehem and said go and make certain where the young child is and when you have seen him let me have news of it so that i may come and give him worship
 and after hearing the king they went on their way and the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came to rest over the place where the young child was
 and when they saw the star they were full of joy
 and they came into the house and saw the young child with mary his mother and falling down on their faces they gave him worship and from their store they gave him offerings of gold perfume and spices
 and it was made clear to them by god in a dream that they were not to go back to herod so they went into their country by another way
 and when they had gone an angel of the lord came to joseph in a dream saying get up and take the young child and his mother and go into egypt and do not go from there till i give you word for herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death
 so he took the young child and his mother by night and went into egypt
 and was there till the death of herod so that the word of the lord through the prophet might come true out of egypt have i sent for my son
 then herod when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men was very angry and he sent out and put to death all the male children in beth lehem and in all the parts round about it from two years old and under acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men
 then the word of jeremiah the prophet came true
 in ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow rachel weeping for her children and she would not be comforted for their loss
 but when herod was dead an angel of the lord came in a dream to joseph in egypt
 saying get up and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel because they who were attempting to take the young childs life are dead
 and he got up and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel
 but when it came to his ears that archelaus was ruling over judaea in the place of his father herod he was in fear of going there and god having given him news of the danger in a dream he went out of the way into the country parts of galilee
 and he came and was living in a town named nazareth so that the word of the prophets might come true he will be named a nazarene
 for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to get workers into his vine garden
 and when he had made an agreement with the workmen for a penny a day he sent them into his vine garden
 and he went out about the third hour and saw others in the market place doing nothing
 and he said to them go into the vine garden with the others and whatever is right i will give you and they went to work
 again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did the same
 and about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing and he says to them why are you here all the day doing nothing
 they say to him because no man has given us work he says to them go in with the rest into the vine garden
 and when evening came the lord of the vine garden said to his manager let the workers come and give them their payment from the last to the first
 and when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour they were given every man a penny
 then those who came first had the idea that they would get more and they like the rest were given a penny
 and when they got it they made a protest against the master of the house
 saying these last have done only one hours work and you have made them equal to us who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat
 but he in answer said to one of them friend i do you no wrong did you not make an agreement with me for a penny
 take what is yours and go away it is my pleasure to give to this last even as to you
 have i not the right to do as seems good to me in my house or is your eye evil because i am good
 so the last will be first and the first last
 and when jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples on one side and said to them
 see we go up to jerusalem and the son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes and they will give orders for him to be put to death
 and will give him up to the gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross and the third day he will come back again from the dead
 then the mother of the sons of zebedee came to him with her sons giving him worship and making a request of him
 and he said to her what is your desire she says to him let my two sons be seated the one at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom
 but jesus made answer and said you have no idea what you are requesting are you able to take of the cup which i am about to take
 they say to him we are able he says to them truly you will take of my cup but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give but it is for those for whom my father has made it ready
 and when it came to the ears of the ten they were angry with the two brothers
 but jesus said to them you see that the rulers of the gentiles are lords over them and their great ones have authority over them
 let it not be so among you but if anyone has a desire to become great among you let him be your servant
 and whoever has a desire to be first among you let him take the lowest place
 even as the son of man did not come to have servants but to be a servant and to give his life for the salvation of men
 and when they were going out from jericho a great number went after him
 and two blind men seated by the wayside when they had the news that jesus was going by gave a loud cry saying lord son of david have mercy on us
 and the people gave them orders to be quiet but they went on crying even louder lord son of david have mercy on us
 and jesus stopping sent for them and said what would you have me do to you
 they say to him lord that our eyes may be open
 and jesus being moved with pity put his fingers on their eyes and straight away they were able to see and went after him
 and when they were near jerusalem and had come to beth phage to the mountain of olives jesus sent two disciples
 saying to them go into the little town in front of you and straight away you will see an ass with a cord round her neck and a young one with her let them loose and come with them to me
 and if anyone says anything to you you will say the lord has need of them and straight away he will send them
 now this took place so that these words of the prophet might come true
 say to the daughter of zion see your king comes to you gentle and seated on an ass and on a young ass
 and the disciples went and did as jesus had given them orders
 and got the ass and the young one and put their clothing on them and he took his seat on it
 and all the people put their clothing down in the way and others got branches from the trees and put them down in the way
 and those who went before him and those who came after gave loud cries saying glory to the son of david a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord glory in the highest
 and when he came into jerusalem all the town was moved saying who is this
 and the people said this is the prophet jesus from nazareth of galilee
 and jesus went into the temple and sent out all who were trading there overturning the tables of the money changers and the seats of those trading in doves
 and he said to them it is in the writings my house is to be named a house of prayer but you are making it a hole of thieves
 and the blind and the broken in body came to him in the temple and he made them well
 but when the chief priests and the scribes saw the works of power which he did and the children crying out in the temple glory to the son of david they were angry and said to him
 have you any idea what these are saying and jesus said to them yes have you not seen in the writings from the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete
 and he went away from them and went out of the town to bethany and was there for the night
 now in the morning when he was coming back to the town he had a desire for food
 and seeing a fig tree by the wayside he came to it and saw nothing on it but leaves only and he said to it let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever and straight away the fig tree became dry and dead
 and when the disciples saw it they were surprised saying how did the fig tree become dry in so short a time
 and jesus in answer said to them truly i say to you if you have faith without doubting not only may you do what has been done to the fig tree but even if you say to this mountain be taken up and put into the sea it will be done
 and all things whatever you make request for in prayer having faith you will get
 and when he had come into the temple the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching and said by what authority do you do these things and who gave you this authority
 and jesus said to them in answer i will put one question to you and if you give me the answer i will say by what authority i do these things
 the baptism of john where did it come from from heaven or from men and they were reasoning among themselves saying if we say from heaven he will say to us why then did you not have faith in him
 but if we say from men we are in fear of the people because all take john to be a prophet
 and they made answer and said we have no idea then he said to them and i will not say to you by what authority i do these things
 but how does it seem to you a man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go and do work today in the vine garden
 and he said in answer i will not but later changing his decision he went
 and he came to the second and said the same and he made answer and said i go sir and went not
 which of the two did his fathers pleasure they say the first jesus said to them truly i say to you that tax farmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of god before you
 for john came to you in the way of righteousness and you had no faith in him but the tax farmers and the loose women had faith in him and you when you saw it did not even have regret for your sins so as to have faith in him
 give ear to another story a master of a house made a vine garden and put a wall round it and made a place for crushing out the wine and made a tower and let it out to field workers and went into another country
 and when the time for the fruit came near he sent his servants to the workmen to get the fruit
 and the workmen made an attack on his servants giving blows to one putting another to death and stoning another
 again he sent other servants more in number than the first and they did the same to them
 but after that he sent his son to them saying they will have respect for my son
 but when the workmen saw the son they said among themselves this is he who will one day be the owner of the property come let us put him to death and take his heritage
 and they took him and driving him out of the vine garden put him to death
 when then the lord of the vine garden comes what will he do to those workmen
 they say to him he will put those cruel men to a cruel death and will let out the vine garden to other workmen who will give him the fruit when it is ready
 jesus says to them did you never see in the writings the stone which the builders put on one side the same has been made the chief stone of the building this was the lords doing and it is a wonder in our eyes
 for this reason i say to you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it
 any man falling on this stone will be broken but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust
 and when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the pharisees they saw that he was talking of them
 and though they had a desire to take him they were in fear of the people because in their eyes he was a prophet
 and jesus talking to them again in stories said
 the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who made a feast when his son was married
 and sent out his servants to get in the guests to the feast and they would not come
 again he sent out other servants with orders to say to the guests see i have made ready my feast my oxen and my fat beasts have been put to death and all things are ready come to the feast
 but they gave no attention and went about their business one to his farm another to his trade
 and the rest put violent hands on his servants and did evil to them and put them to death
 but the king was angry and he sent his armies and those who had put his servants to death he gave to destruction burning down their town with fire
 then he said to his servants the feast is ready but the guests were not good enough
 go then to the cross roads and get all those whom you see to come to the bride feast
 and those servants went out into the streets and got together all those whom they came across bad and good and the feast was full of guests
 but when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man who had not on a guests robe
 and he says to him friend how came you in here not having a guests robe and he had nothing to say
 then the king said to the servants put cords round his hands and feet and put him out into the dark there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 for out of all to whom the good news has come only a small number will get salvation
 then the pharisees went and had a meeting to see how they might make use of his words to take him
 and they sent to him their disciples with the herodians saying master we see that you are true and that you are teaching the true way of god and have no fear of anyone because you have no respect for a mans position
 give us then your opinion of this is it right to give tax to caesar or not
 but jesus saw their trick and said oh false ones why are you attempting to put me in the wrong
 let me see the tax money and they gave him a penny
 and he said to them whose is this image and name on it
 they say to him caesars then he said to them give to caesar the things which are caesars and to god the things which are gods
 and hearing it they were full of wonder and went away from him
 on the same day there came to him the sadducees who say that there is no coming back from the dead and they put a question to him saying
 master moses said if a man at the time of his death has no children let his brother take his wife and get a family for his brother
 now there were among us seven brothers and the first was married and at his death having no seed gave his wife to his brother
 in the same way the second and the third up to the seventh
 and last of all the woman came to her end
 when they come back from the dead then whose wife will she be of the seven because they all had her
 but jesus said to them in answer you are in error not having knowledge of the writings or of the power of god
 for when they come back from the dead there are no husbands and wives but they are as the angels in heaven
 but about the dead coming back to life have you no knowledge of what was said to you by god in the writings
 i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living
 and the people hearing it were surprised at his teaching
 but the pharisees hearing how the mouths of the sadducees had been stopped came together
 and one of them a teacher of the law put a question to him testing him and saying
 master which is the chief rule in the law
 and he said to him have love for the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
 this is the first and greatest rule
 and a second like it is this have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 on these two rules all the law and the prophets are based
 now while the pharisees were together jesus put a question to them saying
 what is your opinion of the christ whose son is he they say to him the son of david
 he says to them how then does david in the spirit give him the name of lord saying
 the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand till i put under your feet all those who are against you
 if david then gives him the name of lord how is he his son
 and no one was able to give him an answer and so great was their fear of him that from that day no one put any more questions to him
 then jesus said to the people and to his disciples
 the scribes and the pharisees have the authority of moses
 all things then which they give you orders to do these do and keep but do not take their works as your example for they say and do not
 they make hard laws and put great weights on mens backs but they themselves will not put a finger to them
 but all their works they do so as to be seen by men for they make wide their phylacteries and the edges of their robes
 and the things desired by them are the first places at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
 and words of respect in the market places and to be named by men teacher
 but you may not be named teacher for one is your teacher and you are all brothers
 and give no man the name of father on earth because one is your father who is in heaven
 and you may not be named guides because one is your guide even christ
 but let the greatest among you be your servant
 and whoever makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high
 but a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  because you are shutting the kingdom of heaven against men for you do not go in yourselves and those who are going in you keep back
   
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you go about land and sea to get one disciple and having him you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves
 a curse is on you blind guides who say whoever takes an oath by the temple it is nothing but whoever takes an oath by the gold of the temple he is responsible
 you foolish ones and blind which is greater the gold or the temple which makes the gold holy
 and whoever takes an oath by the altar it is nothing but whoever takes an oath by the offering which is on it he is responsible
 you blind ones which is greater the offering or the altar which makes the offering holy
 he then who takes an oath by the altar takes it by the altar and by all things on it
 and he who takes an oath by the temple takes it by the temple and by him whose house it is
 and he who takes an oath by heaven takes it by the seat of god and by him who is seated on it
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you make men give a tenth of all sorts of sweet smelling plants but you give no thought to the more important things of the law righteousness and mercy and faith but it is right for you to do these and not to let the others be undone
 you blind guides who take out a fly from your drink but make no trouble over a camel
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the plate but inside they are full of violent behaviour and uncontrolled desire
 you blind pharisee first make clean the inside of the cup and of the plate so that the outside may become equally clean
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  for you are like the resting places of the dead which are made white and seem beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead mens bones and of all unclean things
 even so you seem to men to be full of righteousness but inside you are all false and full of wrongdoing
 a curse is on you scribes and pharisees false ones  because you put up buildings for housing the dead bodies of the prophets and make fair the last resting places of good men and say
 if we had been living in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in the blood of the prophets
 so that you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the sons of those who put the prophets to death
 make full then the measure of your fathers
 you snakes offspring of snakes how will you be kept from the punishment of hell
 for this reason i send you prophets and wise men and scribes some of them you will put to death and put on the cross and to some of them you will give blows in your synagogues driving them from town to town
 so that on you may come all the blood of the upright on the earth from the blood of upright abel to the blood of zachariah son of barachiah whom you put to death between the temple and the altar
 truly i say to you all these things will come on this generation
 o jerusalem jerusalem putting to death the prophets and stoning those who are sent to her  again and again would i have taken your children to myself as a bird takes her young ones under her wings and you would not 
 see your house is made waste
 for i say to you you will not see me from this time till you say a blessing on him who comes in the name of the lord
 and jesus went out of the temple and on the way his disciples came to him pointing out the buildings of the temple
 but he answering said to them see you not all these things truly i say to you that here there will not be one stone resting on another which will not be pulled down
 and while he was seated on the mountain of olives the disciples came to him privately saying make clear to us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world
 and jesus said to them in answer take care that you are not tricked
 for people will come in my name saying i am the christ and a number will be turned from the true way through them
 and news will come to you of wars and talk of wars do not be troubled for these things have to be but it is still not the end
 for nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom and men will be without food and the earth will be shaking in different places
 but all these things are the first of the troubles
 then they will be cruel to you and will put you to death and you will be hated by all nations because of my name
 and numbers of people will be turned from the right way and will give one another up and have hate for one another
 and a number of false prophets will come causing error
 and because wrongdoing will be increased the love of most people will become cold
 but he who goes through to the end will get salvation
 and this good news of the kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations and then the end will come
 when then you see in the holy place the unclean thing which makes destruction of which word was given by daniel the prophet  let this be clear to the reader 
 then let those who are in judaea go in flight to the mountains
 let not him who is on the house top go down to take anything out of his house
 and let not him who is in the field go back to get his coat
 but it will be hard for women who are with child and for those with babies at the breast in those days
 and say a prayer that your flight may not be in the winter or on a sabbath
 because in those days there will be great sorrow such as there has not been from the start of the world till now or ever will be
 and if those days had not been made short there would have been no salvation for any but because of the saints those days will be made short
 then if any man says to you see here is the christ or here do not put faith in him
 for there will come up false christs and false prophets who will do great signs and wonders so that if possible even the saints might be tricked
 see i have made it clear to you before it comes about
 if then they say to you see he is in the waste land go not out see he is in the inner rooms put no faith in it
 because as in a thunderstorm the bright light coming from the east is seen even in the west so will be the coming of the son of man
 wherever the dead body is there will the eagles come together
 but straight away after the trouble of those days the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light and the stars will come down from heaven and the powers of heaven will be moved
 and then the sign of the son of man will be seen in heaven and then all the nations of the earth will have sorrow and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
 and he will send out his angels with a great sound of a horn and they will get his saints together from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other
 now take an example from the fig tree when her branch has become soft and puts out its leaves you are certain that the summer is near
 even so when you see all these things you may be certain that he is near even at the doors
 truly i say to you this generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete
 heaven and earth will come to an end but my words will not come to an end
 but of that day and hour no one has knowledge not even the angels in heaven or the son but the father only
 and as were the days of noah so will be the coming of the son of man
 because as in those days before the overflowing of the waters they were feasting and taking wives and getting married till the day when noah went into the ark
 and they had no care till the waters came and took them all away so will be the coming of the son of man
 then two men will be in the field one is taken and one let go
 two women will be crushing grain one is taken and one let go
 be watching then  for you have no knowledge on what day your lord will come
 but be certain of this that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming he would have been watching and would not have let his house be broken into
 be ready then for at a time which you have no thought of the son of man will come
 who is the true and wise servant whom his lord has put over those in his house to give them their food at the right time
 a blessing on that servant who will be doing so when his lord comes
 truly i say to you he will put him over all he has
 but if that evil servant says in his heart my lord is a long time in coming
 and is cruel to the other servants taking his pleasure with those who are overcome with wine
 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he is not looking for him and in an hour of which he has no knowledge
 and will have him cut in two and will give him a part in the fate of the false ones there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins the friends of the bride who took their lights and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband
 and five of them were foolish and five were wise
 for the foolish when they took their lights took no oil with them
 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights
 now the husband was a long time in coming and they all went to sleep
 but in the middle of the night there is a cry the husband comes  go out to him
 then all those virgins got up and made ready their lights
 and the foolish said to the wise give us of your oil for our lights are going out
 but the wise made answer saying there may not be enough for us and you it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves
 and while they went to get oil the master came and those who were ready went in with him to the feast and the door was shut
 after that the other virgins came saying lord lord let us in
 but he made answer and said truly i say to you i have no knowledge of you
 keep watch then because you are not certain of the day or of the hour
 for it is as when a man about to take a journey got his servants together and gave them his property
 and to one he gave five talents to another two to another one to everyone as he was able and he went on his journey
 straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them and made five more
 in the same way he who had been given the two got two more
 but he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth and kept his lords money in a secret place
 now after a long time the lord of those servants comes and makes up his account with them
 and he who had the five talents came with his other five talents saying lord you gave into my care five talents see i have got five more
 his lord said to him well done good and true servant you have been true in a small thing i will give you control over great things take your part in the joy of your lord
 and he who had the two talents came and said lord you gave into my care two talents see i have got two more
 his lord said to him well done good and true servant you have been true in a small thing i will give you control over great things take your part in the joy of your lord
 and he who had had the one talent came and said lord i had knowledge that you are a hard man getting in grain where you have not put seed and making profits for which you have done no work
 and i was in fear and went away and put your talent in the earth here is what is yours
 but his lord in answer said to him you are a bad and unready servant if you had knowledge that i get in grain where i did not put seed and make profits for which i have done no work
 why then did you not put my money in the bank and at my coming i would have got back what is mine with interest
 take away then his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents
 for to everyone who has will be given and he will have more but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away
 and put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark there will be weeping and cries of sorrow
 but when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then will he be seated in his glory
 and before him all the nations will come together and they will be parted one from another as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper
 and he will put the sheep on his right but the goats on the left
 then will the king say to those on his right come you who have the blessing of my father into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was
 for i was in need of food and you gave it to me i was in need of drink and you gave it to me i was wandering and you took me in
 i had no clothing and you gave it to me when i was ill or in prison you came to me
 then will the upright make answer to him saying lord when did we see you in need of food and give it to you or in need of drink and give it to you
 and when did we see you wandering and take you in or without clothing and give it to you
 and when did we see you ill or in prison and come to you
 and the king will make answer and say to them truly i say to you because you did it to the least of these my brothers you did it to me
 then will he say to those on the left go from me you cursed ones into the eternal fire which is ready for the evil one and his angels
 for i was in need of food and you gave it not to me i was in need of drink and you gave it not to me
 i was wandering and you took me not in without clothing and you gave me no clothing ill and in prison and you came not to me
 then will they make answer saying lord when did we see you in need of food or drink or wandering or without clothing or ill or in prison and did not take care of you
 then will he make answer to them saying truly i say to you because you did it not to the least of these you did it not to me
 and these will go away into eternal punishment but the upright into eternal life
 and when jesus had come to the end of all these words he said to his disciples
 after two days is the passover and the son of man will be given up to the death of the cross
 then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest who was named caiaphas
 and they made designs together to take jesus by some trick and put him to death
 but they said not while the feast is going on for fear of trouble among the people
 now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper
 there came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table
 but when the disciples saw it they were angry saying to what purpose is this waste
 for we might have got much money for this and given it to the poor
 but jesus seeing it said to them why are you troubling the woman she has done a kind act to me
 for the poor you have ever with you but me you have not for ever
 for in putting this perfume on my body she did it to make me ready for my last resting place
 truly i say to you wherever this good news goes out in all the world what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her
 then one of the twelve who was named judas iscariot went to the chief priests and said
 what will you give me if i give him up to you and the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver
 and from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands
 now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying where are we to make ready for you to take the passover meal
 and he said to them go into the town to such a man and say to him the master says my time is near i will keep the passover at your house with my disciples
 and the disciples did as jesus had said to them and they made ready the passover
 now when evening was come he was seated at table with the twelve disciples
 and while they were taking food he said truly i say to you that one of you will be false to me
 and they were very said and said to him one by one is it i lord
 and he made answer and said he who puts his hand into the plate with me the same will be false to me
 the son of man goes even as the writings say of him but a curse is on that man through whom the son of man is given up it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world
 and judas who was false to him made answer and said is it i master he says to him yes
 and when they were taking food jesus took bread and after blessing it he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said take it this is my body
 and he took a cup and having given praise he gave it to them saying
 take of it all of you for this is my blood of the testament which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins
 but i say to you that from now i will not take of this fruit of the vine till that day when i take it new with you in my fathers kingdom
 and after a song of praise to god they went out to the mountain of olives
 then said jesus to them all of you will be turned away from me this night for it is said in the writings i will put to death the keeper of the sheep and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight
 but after i am come back from the dead i will go before you into galilee
 but peter made answer and said to him though all may be turned away from you i will never be turned away
 jesus said to him truly i say to you that this night before the hour of the cocks cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me
 peter says to him even if i am put to death with you i will not be false to you so said all the disciples
 then comes jesus with them to a place named gethsemane and says to his disciples be seated here while i go over there for prayer
 and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and became sad and very troubled
 then says he to them my soul is very sad even to death keep watch with me here
 and he went forward a little and falling down on his face in prayer he said o my father if it is possible let this cup go from me but let not my pleasure but yours be done
 and he comes to the disciples and sees that they are sleeping and says to peter what were you not able to keep watch with me one hour
 keep watch with prayer so that you may not be put to the test the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is feeble
 again a second time he went away and said in prayer o my father if this may not go from me without my taking it let your pleasure be done
 and he came again and saw them sleeping for their eyes were tired
 and he went away from them again and a third time said the same prayer
 then he comes to the disciples and says to them go on sleeping now and take your rest for the hour is come and the son of man is given into the hands of evil men
 up let us be going see he who gives me up is near
 and while he was still talking judas one of the twelve came and with him a band armed with swords and sticks from the chief priests and those in authority over the people
 now the false one had given them a sign saying the one to whom i give a kiss that is he take him
 and straight away he came to jesus and said master  and gave him a kiss
 and jesus said to him friend do that for which you have come then they came and put hands on jesus and took him
 and one of those who were with jesus put out his hand and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow cutting off his ear
 then says jesus to him put up your sword again into its place for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword
 does it not seem possible to you that if i make request to my father he will even now send me an army of angels
 but how then would the writings come true which say that so it has to be
 in that hour jesus said to the people have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me i was teaching every day in the temple and you took me not
 but all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true then all his disciples went from him in flight
 and those who had made jesus prisoner took him away to the house of caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together
 but peter went after him at a distance to the house of the high priest and went in and took his seat with the servants to see the end
 now the chief priests and all the sanhedrin were looking for false witness against jesus so that they might put him to death
 and they were not able to get it though a number of false witnesses came
 but later there came two who said this man said i am able to give the temple of god to destruction and to put it up again in three days
 and the high priest got up and said to him have you no answer what is it which these say against you
 but jesus said not a word and the high priest said to him i put you on oath by the living god that you will say to us if you are the christ the son of god
 jesus says to him you say so but i say to you from now you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven
 then the high priest violently parting his robes said he has said evil against god what more need have we of witnesses for now his words against god have come to your ears
 what is your opinion they made answer and said it is right for him to be put to death
 then they put shame on him and were cruel to him and some gave him blows saying
 be a prophet o christ and say who gave you a blow 
 now peter was seated in the open square outside the house and a servant girl came to him saying you were with jesus the galilaean
 but he said before them all that it was false saying i have no knowledge of what you say
 and when he had gone out into the doorway another saw him and says to those who were there this man was with jesus the nazarene
 and again he said with an oath i have no knowledge of the man
 and after a little time those who were near came and said to peter truly you are one of them because your talk is witness against you
 then with curses and oaths he said i have no knowledge of the man and straight away there came the cry of a cock
 and the word of jesus came back to peter when he said before the hour of the cocks cry you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me and he went out weeping bitterly
 now when it was morning all the chief priests and those in authority took thought together with the purpose of putting jesus to death
 and they put cords on him and took him away and gave him up to pilate the ruler
 then judas who was false to him seeing that he was to be put to death in his regret took back the thirty bits of silver to the chief priests and those in authority
 saying i have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man but they said what is that to us it is your business
 and he put down the silver in the temple and went out and put himself to death by hanging
 and the chief priests took the silver and said it is not right to put it in the temple store for it is the price of blood
 and they made a decision to get with the silver the potters field as a place for the dead of other countries
 for this cause that field was named the field of blood to this day
 then came true that which was said by jeremiah the prophet and they took the thirty bits of silver the price of him who was valued by the children of israel
 and they gave them for the potters field as i had word from the lord
 and jesus was before the ruler who put a question to him are you the king of the jews and jesus said to him you say so
 but when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him he gave no answer
 then says pilate to him do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you
 and he gave him no answer not even a word so that the ruler was greatly surprised
 now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner at their selection
 and they had then an important prisoner whose name was barabbas
 so when they came together pilate said to them whom will you have barabbas or jesus who is named christ
 for he saw that for envy they had given him up
 and while he was on the judges seat his wife sent to him saying have nothing to do with that upright man for i have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him
 now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for barabbas and for jesus to be put to death
 but the ruler made answer and said to them which of the two is it your pleasure that i let go free and they said barabbas
 pilate says to them what then am i to do with jesus who is named christ they all say let him be put to death on the cross
 and he said why what evil has he done but they gave loud cries saying to the cross with him 
 so when pilate saw that he was able to do nothing but that trouble was working up he took water and washing his hands before the people said the blood of this upright man is not on my hands you are responsible
 and all the people made answer and said let his blood be on us and on our children
 then he let barabbas go free but after having jesus whipped he gave him up to be put to death on the cross
 then the rulers armed men took jesus into the open square and got all their band together
 and they took off his clothing and put on him a red robe
 and they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head and put a rod in his right hand and they went down on their knees before him and made sport of him saying long life to the king of the jews
 and they put shame on him and gave him blows on the head with the rod
 and when they had made sport of him they took the robe off him and put his clothing on him and took him away to put him on the cross
 and while they were coming out they saw a man of cyrene simon by name and they made him go with them so that he might take up his cross
 and when they came to the place named golgotha that is to say dead mans head
 they gave him wine mixed with bitter drink and after tasting it he took no more
 and when they had put him on the cross they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance
 and they were seated there watching him
 and they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing this is jesus the king of the jews
 then two thieves were put on crosses with him one on the right and one on the left
 and those who went by said bitter words to him shaking their heads and saying
 you who would give the temple to destruction and put it up again in three days get yourself free if you are the son of god come down from the cross
 in the same way the chief priests making sport of him with the scribes and those in authority said
 a saviour of others he has no salvation for himself if he is the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will have faith in him
 he put his faith in god let god be his saviour now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god
 and the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him
 now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour
 and about the ninth hour jesus gave a loud cry saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is my god my god why are you turned away from me
 and some of those who were near by hearing it said this man is crying to elijah
 and straight away one of them went quickly and took a sponge and made it full of bitter wine and put it on a rod and gave him drink
 and the rest said let him be let us see if elijah will come to his help
 and jesus gave another loud cry and gave up his spirit
 and the curtain of the temple was parted in two from end to end and there was an earth shock and the rocks were broken
 and the resting places of the dead came open and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life
 and coming out of their resting places after he had come again from the dead they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people
 now the captain and those who were with him watching jesus when they saw the earth shock and the things which were done were in great fear and said truly this was a son of god
 and a number of women were there watching from a distance who had come with jesus from galilee waiting on his needs
 among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of the sons of zebedee
 and in the evening there came a man of wealth from arimathaea joseph by name who was a disciple of jesus
 this man went in to pilate and made a request for the body of jesus then pilate gave orders for it to be given to him
 and joseph took the body folding it in clean linen
 and put it in the resting place which had been cut out of the rock for himself and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away
 and mary magdalene was there and the other mary seated by the place of the dead
 now on the day after the getting ready of the passover the chief priests and pharisees came together to pilate
 saying sir we have in mind how that false man said while he was still living after three days i will come again from the dead
 give orders then that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people he has come back from the dead and the last error will be worse than the first
 pilate said to them you have watchmen go and make it as safe as you are able
 so they went and made safe the place where his body was putting a stamp on the stone and the watchmen were with them
 now late on the sabbath when the dawn of the first day of the week was near mary magdalene and the other mary came to see the place where his body was
 and there was a great earth shock for an angel of the lord came down from heaven and rolling back the stone took his seat on it
 his form was shining like the light and his clothing was white as snow
 and for fear of him the watchmen were shaking and became as dead men
 and the angel said to the women have no fear for i see that you are searching for jesus who was put to death on the cross
 he is not here for he has come to life again even as he said come see the lords resting place
 and go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead and is going before you into galilee there you will see him as i have said to you
 and they went away quickly with fear and great joy to give his disciples the news
 and on the way jesus came to them saying be glad and they came and put their hands on his feet and gave him worship
 then said jesus to them have no fear go and give word to my brothers to go into galilee and there they will see me
 now while they were going some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place
 and when they had come together with those in authority and had made their decision they gave much money to the watchmen saying
 say his disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping
 and if this comes to the rulers ears we will see that he does not make you responsible
 so they took the money and did as they had been ordered and this account has been current among the jews till the present time
 but the eleven disciples went into galilee to the mountain where jesus had given them orders to go
 and when they saw him they gave him worship but some were in doubt
 and jesus came to them and said all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth
 go then and make disciples of all the nations giving them baptism in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
 teaching them to keep all the rules which i have given you and see i am ever with you even to the end of the world
 and in those days john the baptist came preaching in the waste land of judaea
 saying let your hearts be turned from sin for the kingdom of heaven is near
 for this is he of whom isaiah the prophet said the voice of one crying in the waste land make ready the way of the lord make his roads straight
 now john was clothed in camels hair with a leather band about him and his food was locusts and honey
 then jerusalem and all judaea went out to him and all the people from near jordan
 and they were given baptism by him in the river jordan saying openly that they had done wrong
 but when he saw a number of the pharisees and sadducees coming to his baptism he said to them offspring of snakes at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come
 let your change of heart be seen in your works
 and say not to yourselves we have abraham for our father because i say to you that god is able from these stones to make children for abraham
 and even now the axe is put to the root of the trees every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down and put into the fire
 truly i give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed but he who comes after me is greater than i whose shoes i am not good enough to take up he will give you baptism with the holy spirit and with fire
 in whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain he will put the good grain in his store but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out
 then jesus came from galilee to john at the jordan to be given baptism by him
 but john would have kept him back saying it is i who have need of baptism from you and do you come to me
 but jesus made answer saying to him let it be so now because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete then he gave him baptism
 and jesus having been given baptism straight away went up from the water and the heavens opening he saw the spirit of god coming down on him as a dove
 and a voice came out of heaven saying this is my dearly loved son with whom i am well pleased
 then jesus was sent by the spirit into the waste land to be tested by the evil one
 and after going without food for forty days and forty nights he was in need of it
 and the evil one came and said to him if you are the son of god give the word for these stones to become bread
 but he made answer and said it is in the writings bread is not mans only need but every word which comes out of the mouth of god
 then the evil one took him to the holy town and he put him on the highest point of the temple and said to him
 if you are the son of god let yourself go down for it is in the writings he will give his angels care over you and in their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
 jesus said to him again it is in the writings you may not put the lord your god to the test
 again the evil one took him up to a very high mountain and let him see all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
 and he said to him all these things will i give you if you will go down on your face and give me worship
 then said jesus to him away satan for it is in the writings give worship to the lord your god and be his servant only
 then the evil one went away from him and angels came and took care of him
 now when it came to his ears that john had been put in prison he went away to galilee
 and going away from nazareth he came and made his living place in capernaum which is by the sea in the country of zebulun and naphtali
 so that the word of the prophet isaiah might come true
 the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali by the way of the sea the other side of jordan galilee of the gentiles
 the people who were in the dark saw a great light and to those in the land of the shade of death did the dawn come up
 from that time jesus went about preaching and saying let your hearts be turned from sin for the kingdom of heaven is near
 and when he was walking by the sea of galilee he saw two brothers simon whose other name was peter and andrew his brother who were putting a net into the sea for they were fishermen
 and he said to them come after me and i will make you fishers of men
 and straight away they let go the nets and went after him
 and going on from there he saw two other brothers james the son of zebedee and john his brother in the boat with their father stitching up their nets and he said come
 and they went straight from the boat and their father and came after him
 and jesus went about in all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well those who were ill with any disease among the people
 and news of him went out through all syria and they took to him all who were ill with different diseases and pains those having evil spirits and those who were off their heads and those who had no power of moving and he made them well
 and there went after him great numbers from galilee and decapolis and jerusalem and judaea and from the other side of jordan
 and seeing great masses of people he went up into the mountain and when he was seated his disciples came to him
 and with these words he gave them teaching saying
 happy are the poor in spirit for the kingdom of heaven is theirs
 happy are those who are sad for they will be comforted
 happy are the gentle for the earth will be their heritage
 happy are those whose hearts desire is for righteousness for they will have their desire
 happy are those who have mercy for they will be given mercy
 happy are the clean in heart for they will see god
 happy are the peacemakers for they will be named sons of god
 happy are those who are attacked on account of righteousness for the kingdom of heaven will be theirs
 happy are you when men give you a bad name and are cruel to you and say all evil things against you falsely because of me
 be glad and full of joy for great is your reward in heaven for so were the prophets attacked who were before you
 you are the salt of the earth but if its taste goes from the salt how will you make it salt again it is then good for nothing but to be put out and crushed under foot by men
 you are the light of the world a town put on a hill may be seen by all
 and a burning light is not put under a vessel but on its table so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house
 even so let your light be shining before men so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father in heaven
 let there be no thought that i have come to put an end to the law or the prophets i have not come for destruction but to make complete
 truly i say to you till heaven and earth come to an end not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law till all things are done
 whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws teaching men to do the same will be named least in the kingdom of heaven but he who keeps the laws teaching others to keep them will be named great in the kingdom of heaven
 for i say to you if your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you will never go into the kingdom of heaven
 you have knowledge that it was said in old times you may not put to death and whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged
 but i say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged and he who says to his brother raca will be in danger from the sanhedrin and whoever says you foolish one will be in danger of the hell of fire
 if then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you
 while your offering is still before the altar first go and make peace with your brother then come and make your offering
 come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law while you are with him on the way for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison
 truly i say to you you will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing
 you have knowledge that it was said you may not have connection with another mans wife
 but i say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart
 and if your right eye is a cause of trouble to you take it out and put it away from you because it is better to undergo the loss of one part than for all your body to go into hell
 and if your right hand is a cause of trouble to you let it be cut off and put it away from you because it is better to undergo the loss of one part than for all your body to go into hell
 again it was said whoever puts away his wife has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose
 but i say to you that everyone who puts away his wife for any other cause but the loss of her virtue makes her false to her husband and whoever takes her as his wife after she is put away is no true husband to her
 again you have knowledge that it was said in old times do not take false oaths but give effect to your oaths to the lord
 but i say to you take no oaths at all not by the heaven because it is the seat of god
 or by the earth because it is the resting place for his foot or by jerusalem because it is the town of the great king
 you may not take an oath by your head because you are not able to make one hair white or black
 but let your words be simply yes or no and whatever is more than these is of the evil one
 you have knowledge that it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
 but i say to you do not make use of force against an evil man but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned
 and if any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat do not keep back your robe from him
 and whoever makes you go one mile go with him two
 give to him who comes with a request and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it
 you have knowledge that it was said have love for your neighbour and hate for him who is against you
 but i say to you have love for those who are against you and make prayer for those who are cruel to you
 so that you may be the sons of your father in heaven for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner
 for if you have love for those who have love for you what credit is it to you do not the tax farmers the same
 and if you say good day to your brothers only what do you do more than others do not even the gentiles the same
 be then complete in righteousness even as your father in heaven is complete
 take care not to do your good works before men to be seen by them or you will have no reward from your father in heaven
 when then you give money to the poor do not make a noise about it as the false hearted men do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may have glory from men truly i say to you they have their reward
 but when you give money let not your left hand see what your right hand does
 so that your giving may be in secret and your father who sees in secret will give you your reward
 and when you make your prayers be not like the false hearted men who take pleasure in getting up and saying their prayers in the synagogues and at the street turnings so that they may be seen by men truly i say to you they have their reward
 but when you make your prayer go into your private room and shutting the door say a prayer to your father in secret and your father who sees in secret will give you your reward
 and in your prayer do not make use of the same words again and again as the gentiles do for they have the idea that god will give attention to them because of the number of their words
 so be not like them because your father has knowledge of your needs even before you make your requests to him
 let this then be your prayer our father in heaven may your name be kept holy
 let your kingdom come let your pleasure be done as in heaven so on earth
 give us this day bread for our needs
 and make us free of our debts as we have made those free who are in debt to us
 and let us not be put to the test but keep us safe from the evil one
 for if you let men have forgiveness for their sins you will have forgiveness from your father in heaven
 but if you do not let men have forgiveness for their sins you will not have forgiveness from your father for your sins
 and when you go without food be not sad faced as the false hearted are for they go about with changed looks so that men may see that they are going without food truly i say to you they have their reward
 but when you go without food put oil on your head and make your face clean
 so that no one may see that you are going without food but your father in secret and your father who sees in secret will give you your reward
 make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather and where thieves may come in by force and take it away
 but make a store for yourselves in heaven where it will not be turned to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away
 for where your wealth is there will your heart be
 the light of the body is the eye if then your eye is true all your body will be full of light
 but if your eye is evil all your body will be dark if then the light which is in you is dark how dark it will be 
 no man is able to be a servant to two masters for he will have hate for the one and love for the other or he will keep to one and have no respect for the other you may not be servants of god and of wealth
 so i say to you take no thought for your life about food or drink or about clothing for your body is not life more than food and the body more than its clothing
 see the birds of heaven they do not put seeds in the earth they do not get in grain or put it in store houses and your father in heaven gives them food are you not of much more value than they
 and which of you by taking thought is able to make himself a cubit taller
 and why are you troubled about clothing see the flowers of the field how they come up they do no work they make no thread
 but i say to you that even solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these
 but if god gives such clothing to the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is put into the oven will he not much more give you clothing o you of little faith
 then do not be full of care saying what are we to have for food or drink or with what may we be clothed
 because the gentiles go in search of all these things for your father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things
 but let your first care be for his kingdom and his righteousness and all these other things will be given to you in addition
 then have no care for tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself take the trouble of the day as it comes
 be not judges of others and you will not be judged
 for as you have been judging so you will be judged and with your measure will it be measured to you
 and why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brothers eye but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye
 or how will you say to your brother let me take out the grain of dust from your eye when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye
 you false one first take out the bit of wood from your eye then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brothers eye
 do not give that which is holy to the dogs or put your jewels before pigs for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you
 make a request and it will be answered what you are searching for you will get give the sign and the door will be open to you
 because to everyone who makes a request it will be given and he who is searching will get his desire and to him who gives the sign the door will be open
 or which of you if his son makes a request for bread will give him a stone
 or if he makes a request for a fish will give him a snake
 if you then being evil are able to give good things to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him
 all those things then which you would have men do to you even so do you to them because this is the law and the prophets
 go in by the narrow door for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction and great numbers go in by it
 for narrow is the door and hard the road to life and only a small number make discovery of it
 be on the watch for false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inside they are cruel wolves
 by their fruits you will get knowledge of them do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles
 even so every good tree gives good fruit but the bad tree gives evil fruit
 it is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit and a bad tree will not give good fruit
 every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire
 so by their fruits you will get knowledge of them
 not everyone who says to me lord lord will go into the kingdom of heaven but he who does the pleasure of my father in heaven
 a great number will say to me on that day lord lord were we not prophets in your name and did we not by your name send out evil spirits and by your name do works of power
 and then will i say to them i never had knowledge of you go from me you workers of evil
 everyone then to whom my words come and who does them will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock
 and the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house but it was not moved because it was based on the rock
 and everyone to whom my words come and who does them not will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand
 and the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house and it came down and great was its fall
 and it came about when jesus had come to the end of these words that the people were surprised at his teaching
 for he was teaching as one having authority and not as their scribes
 and when he had come down from the mountain great numbers of people came after him
 and a leper came and gave him worship saying lord if it is your pleasure you have power to make me clean
 and he put his hand on him saying it is my pleasure be clean and straight away he was made clean
 and jesus said to him see that you say nothing about this to anyone but go and let the priest see you and make the offering which was ordered by moses for a witness to them
 and when jesus was come into capernaum a certain captain came to him with a request
 saying lord my servant is ill in bed at the house with no power in his body and in great pain
 and he said to him i will come and make him well
 and the captain in answer said lord i am not good enough for you to come under my roof but only say the word and my servant will be made well
 because i myself am a man under authority having under me fighting men and i say to this one go and he goes and to another come and he comes and to my servant do this and he does it
 and when these words came to the ears of jesus he was surprised and said to those who came after him truly i say to you i have not seen such great faith no not in israel
 and i say to you that numbers will come from the east and the west and will take their seats with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven
 but the sons of the kingdom will be put out into the dark and there will be weeping and cries of pain
 and jesus said to the captain go in peace as your faith is so let it be done to you and the servant was made well in that hour
 and when jesus had come into peters house he saw his wifes mother in bed very ill
 and he put his hand on hers and the disease went from her and she got up and took care of his needs
 and in the evening they took to him a number of people who had evil spirits and he sent the spirits out of them with a word and made well all who were ill
 so that the word of isaiah the prophet might come true he himself took our pains and our diseases
 now when jesus saw a great mass of people about him he gave an order to go to the other side
 and there came a scribe and said to him master i will come after you wherever you go
 and jesus said to him the foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have a resting place but the son of man has nowhere to put his head
 and another of the disciples said to him lord let me first go and give the last honours to my father
 but jesus said to him come after me and let the dead take care of their dead
 and when he had got into a boat his disciples went after him
 and there came up a great storm in the sea so that the boat was covered with the waves but he was sleeping
 and they came to him and awaking him said help lord destruction is near
 and he said to them why are you full of fear o you of little faith then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the sea and there was a great calm
 and the men were full of wonder saying what sort of man is this that even the winds and the sea do his orders
 and when he had come to the other side to the country of the gadarenes there came out to him from the place of the dead two who had evil spirits so violent that no man was able to go that way
 and they gave a loud cry saying what have we to do with you you son of god have you come here to give us punishment before the time
 now there was some distance away a great herd of pigs taking their food
 and the evil spirits made strong prayers to him saying if you send us out let us go into the herd of pigs
 and he said to them go and they came out and went into the pigs and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water
 and their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything and of the men who had the evil spirits
 and all the town came out to jesus and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country
 and he got into a boat and went across and came to his town
 and they took to him a man stretched on a bed who had no power of moving and jesus seeing their faith said to the man who was ill son take heart you have forgiveness for your sins
 and some of the scribes said among themselves this man has no respect for god
 and jesus having knowledge of what was in their minds said why are your thoughts evil
 for which is the simpler to say you have forgiveness for your sins or to say get up and go
 but so that you may see that on earth the son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins  then said he to the man who was ill  get up and take up your bed and go to your house
 and he got up and went away to his house
 but when the people saw it they were full of fear and gave glory to god who had given such authority to men
 and when jesus was going from there he saw a man whose name was matthew seated at the place where taxes were taken and he said to him come after me and he got up and went after him
 and it came about when he was in the house taking food that a number of tax farmers and sinners came and took their places with jesus and his disciples
 and when the pharisees saw it they said to his disciples why does your master take food with tax farmers and sinners
 but on hearing this he said those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill
 but go and take to heart the sense of these words my desire is for mercy not offerings for i have come not to get the upright but sinners
 then the disciples of john came to him saying why do we and the pharisees frequently go without food but your disciples do not
 and jesus said to them will the friends of the newly married man be sad as long as he is with them but the days will come when he will be taken away from them and then will they go without food
 and no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat for by pulling away from the old it makes a worse hole
 and men do not put new wine into old wine skins or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out and the skins are of no more use but they put new wine into new wine skins and so the two will be safe
 while he was saying these things to them there came a ruler and gave him worship saying my daughter is even now dead but come and put your hand on her and she will come back to life
 and jesus got up and went after him and so did his disciples
 and a woman who for twelve years had had a flow of blood came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe
 because she said to herself if i may but put my hand on his robe i will be made well
 but jesus turning and seeing her said daughter take heart your faith has made you well and the woman was made well from that hour
 and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise
 he said make room for the girl is not dead but sleeping and they were laughing at him
 but when the people were sent out he went in and took her by the hand and the girl got up
 and the news of it went out into all that land
 and when jesus went on from there two blind men came after him crying out have mercy on us you son of david
 and when he had come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus said to them have you faith that i am able to do this they said to him yes lord
 then he put his hand on their eyes saying as your faith is let it be done to you
 and their eyes were made open and jesus said to them sharply let no man have knowledge of it
 but they went out and gave news of him in all that land
 and while they were going away there came to him a man without the power of talking and with an evil spirit
 and when the evil spirit had been sent out the man had the power of talking and they were all surprised saying such a thing has never been seen in israel
 but the pharisees said by the ruler of evil spirits he sends evil spirits out of men
 and jesus went about all the towns and small places teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain
 but when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper
 then he said to his disciples there is much grain but not enough men to get it in
 make prayer then to the lord of the grain fields that he may send out workers to get in his grain
 paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother to philemon our dear helper in the faith
 and to apphia our sister and to archippus our brother in gods army and to the church in your house
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 i give praise to god at all times and make prayer for you
 hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the lord jesus and to all the saints
 that the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power in the knowledge of every good thing in you for christ
 for i had great joy and comfort in your love because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you brother
 and so though i might in the name of christ give you orders to do what is right
 still because of love in place of an order i make a request to you i paul an old man and now a prisoner of christ jesus
 my request is for my child onesimus the child of my chains
 who in the past was of no profit to you but now is of profit to you and to me
 whom i have sent back to you him who is my very heart
 though my desire was to keep him with me to be my servant in the chains of the good news in your place
 but without your approval i would do nothing so that your good works might not be forced but done freely from your heart
 for it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time so that you might have him for ever
 no longer as a servant but more than a servant a brother very dear to me specially but much more to you in the flesh as well as in the lord
 if then you take me to be your friend and brother take him in as myself
 if he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything put it to my account
 i paul writing this myself say i will make payment to you and i do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life
 so brother let me have joy of you in the lord give new life to my heart in christ
 being certain that you will do my desire i am writing to you in the knowledge that you will do even more than i say
 and make a room ready for me for i am hoping that through your prayers i will be given to you
 epaphras my brother prisoner in christ jesus sends you his love
 and so do mark aristarchus demas and luke my brother workers
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit so be it
 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him so that his servants might have knowledge of the things which will quickly take place and he sent and made it clear by his angel to his servant john
 who gave witness of the word of god and of the witness of jesus christ even of all the things which he saw
 a blessing be on the reader and on those who give ear to the prophets words and keep the things which he has put in the book for the time is near
 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace to you and peace from him who is and was and is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his high seat
 and from jesus christ the true witness the first to come back from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth to him who had love for us and has made us clean from our sins by his blood
 and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to his god and father to him let glory and power be given for ever and ever so be it
 see he comes with the clouds and every eye will see him and those by whom he was wounded and all the tribes of the earth will be sorrowing because of him yes so be it
 i am the first and the last says the lord god who is and was and is to come the ruler of all
 i john your brother who have a part with you in the trouble and the kingdom and the quiet strength of jesus was in the island which is named patmos for the word of god and the witness of jesus
 i was in the spirit on the lords day and a great voice at my back as of a horn came to my ears
 saying what you see put in a book and send it to the seven churches to ephesus and to smyrna and to pergamos and to thyatira and to sardis and to philadelphia and to laodicea
 and turning to see the voice which said these words to me i saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them
 and in the middle of them one like a son of man clothed with a robe down to his feet and with a band of gold round his breasts
 and his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire
 and his feet like polished brass as if it had been burned in a fire and his voice was as the sound of great waters
 and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth came a sharp two edged sword and his face was like the sun shining in its strength
 and when i saw him i went down on my face at his feet as one dead and he put his right hand on me saying have no fear i am the first and the last and the living one
 and i was dead and see i am living for ever and i have the keys of death and of hell
 put in writing then the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which will be after these
 the secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lights are the seven churches
 and i saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven clothed with a cloud and an arch of coloured light was round his head and his face was like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire
 and he had in his hand a little open book and he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the earth
 and he gave a loud cry like the angry voice of a lion and at his cry the voices of the seven thunders were sounding
 and when the seven thunders had given out their voices i was about to put their words down and a voice from heaven came to my ears saying keep secret the things which the seven thunders said and do not put them in writing
 and the angel which i saw taking his position on the sea and on the earth put up his right hand to heaven
 and took his oath by him who is living for ever and ever who made the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it that there would be no more waiting
 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when the sound of his horn is about to come then will the secret of god be complete of which he gave the good news to his servants the prophets
 and the voice came to me again from heaven saying go take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who has his place on the sea and on the earth
 and i went to the angel and said to him give me the little book and he said to me put it in your mouth and it will make your stomach bitter but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey
 and i took the little book out of the angels hand and did as he said and it was sweet as honey in my mouth and when i had taken it my stomach was made bitter
 and they said to me you are to give word again of what is coming in the future to the peoples and nations and languages and kings
 and there was given to me a measuring rod and one said go up and take the measure of the house of god and the altar and the worshippers in it
 but do not take the measure of the space outside the house because it has been given to the nations and the holy town will be under their feet for forty two months
 and i will give orders to my two witnesses and they will be prophets for a thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed with haircloth
 these are the two olive trees and the two lights which are before the lord of the earth
 and if any man would do them damage fire comes out of their mouth and puts an end to those who are working against them and if any man has a desire to do them damage in this way will he be put to death
 these have the power to keep the heaven shut so that there may be no rain in the days when they are prophets and they have power over the waters to make them into blood and to send every sort of disease on the earth as their pleasure is
 and when they have come to the end of their witness the beast which comes up out of the great deep will make war on them and overcome them and put them to death
 and their dead bodies will be in the open street of the great town which in the spirit is named sodom and egypt where their lord was put to death on the cross
 and the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will be looking on their dead bodies three days and a half and will not let their dead bodies be put in the earth
 and those who are on the earth will have pleasure and delight over them and they will send offerings one to another because these two prophets gave great trouble to all on the earth
 and after three days and a half the breath of life from god went into them and they got up on their feet and great fear came on those who saw them
 and a great voice from heaven came to their ears saying to them come up here and they went up into heaven in the cloud and were seen by those desiring their death
 and in that hour there was a great earth shock and a tenth part of the town came to destruction and in the earth shock seven thousand persons came to their end and the rest were in fear and gave glory to the god of heaven
 the second trouble is past see the third trouble comes quickly
 and at the sounding of the seventh angel there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he will have rule for ever and ever
 and the four and twenty rulers who are seated before god on their high seats went down on their faces and gave worship to god saying
 we give you praise o lord god ruler of all who is and who was because you have taken up your great power and are ruling your kingdom
 and the nations were angry and your wrath has come and the time for the dead to be judged and the time of reward for your servants the prophets and for the saints and for those in whom is the fear of your name small and great and the time of destruction for those who made the earth unclean
 and the house of god which is in heaven was open and the ark of his agreement was seen in his house and there were flames and voices and thunders and an earth shock and a rain of ice
 and a great sign was seen in heaven a a woman clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
 and she was with child and she gave a cry in the pains of childbirth
 and there was seen another sign in heaven a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and on his heads seven crowns
 and his tail was pulling a third part of the stars of heaven down to the earth and the dragon took his place before the woman who was about to give birth so that when the birth had taken place he might put an end to her child
 and she gave birth to a son a male child who was to have rule over all the nations with a rod of iron and her child was taken up to god and to his high seat
 and the woman went in flight to the waste land where she has a place made ready by god so that there they may give her food a thousand two hundred and sixty days
 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels going out to the fight with the dragon and the dragon and his angels made war
 and they were overcome and there was no more place for them in heaven
 and the great dragon was forced down the old snake who is named the evil one and satan by whom all the earth is turned from the right way he was forced down to the earth and his angels were forced down with him
 and a great voice in heaven came to my ears saying now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ because he who says evil against our brothers before our god day and night is forced down
 and they overcame him through the blood of the lamb and the word of their witness and loving not their lives they freely gave themselves up to death
 be glad then o heavens and you who are in them but there is trouble for the earth and the sea because the evil one has come down to you being very angry having the knowledge that he has but a short time
 and when the dragon saw that he was forced down to the earth he made cruel attacks on the woman who gave birth to the male child
 and there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle so that she might go in flight into the waste land to her place where she is given food for a time and times and half a time from the face of the snake
 and the snake sent out of his mouth after the woman a river of water so that she might be taken away by the stream
 and the earth gave help to the woman and with open mouth took up the river which the dragon sent out of his mouth
 and the dragon was angry with the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her seed who keep the orders of god and the witness of jesus
 and he took his place on the sand of the sea and i saw a beast coming up out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on his horns ten crowns and on his heads unholy names
 and the beast which i saw was like a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority
 and i saw one of his heads as if it had been given a death wound and his death wound was made well and all the earth was wondering at the beast
 and they gave worship to the dragon because he gave authority to the beast and worshipping the beast they said who is like the beast and who is able to go to war with him
 and there was given to him a mouth to say words of pride against god and there was given to him authority to go on for forty two months
 and his mouth was open to say evil against god and against his name and his tent even against those who are in heaven
 and it was given to him to make war on the saints and to overcome them and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and language and nation
 and all who are on the earth will give him worship everyone whose name has not been from the first in the book of life of the lamb who was put to death
 if any man has ears let him give ear
 if any man sends others into prison into prison he will go if any man puts to death with the sword with the sword will he be put to death here is the quiet strength and the faith of the saints
 and i saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and his voice was like that of a dragon
 and he makes use of all the authority of the first beast before his eyes and he makes the earth and those who are in it give worship to the first beast whose death wound was made well
 and he does great signs even making fire come down from heaven on the earth before the eyes of men
 and those who are on the earth are turned from the true way by him through the signs which he was given power to do before the beast giving orders to those who are on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and came to life
 and he had power to give breath to the image of the beast so that words might come from the image of the beast and that he might have all those who did not give worship to the image of the beast put to death
 and he gives to all small and great the poor and those who have wealth the free and those who are not free a mark on their right hand or on their brows
 so that no man might be able to do trade but he who has the mark even the name of the beast or the number of his name
 here is wisdom he who has knowledge let him get the number of the beast because it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred and sixty six
 and i saw the lamb on the mountain of zion and with him a hundred and forty four thousand marked on their brows with his name and the name of his father
 and a voice from heaven came to my ears like the sound of great waters and the sound of loud thunder and the voice which came to me was like the sound of players playing on instruments of music
 and they made as it seemed a new song before the high seat and before the four beasts and the rulers and no man might have knowledge of the song but the hundred and forty four thousand even those from the earth whom god has made his for a price
 these are they who have not made themselves unclean with women for they are virgins these are they who go after the lamb wherever he goes these were taken from among men to be the first fruits to god and to the lamb
 and in their mouth there was no false word for they are untouched by evil
 and i saw another angel in flight between heaven and earth having eternal good news to give to those who are on the earth and to every nation and tribe and language and people
 saying with a loud voice have fear of god and give him glory because the hour of his judging is come and give worship to him who made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water
 and a second angel came after saying destruction has come to babylon the great which gave to all the nations the wine of the wrath of her evil ways
 and a third angel came after them saying with a loud voice if any man gives worship to the beast and his image and has his mark on his brow or on his hand
 to him will be given of the wine of gods wrath which is ready unmixed in the cup of his wrath and he will have cruel pain burning with fire before the holy angels and before the lamb
 and the smoke of their pain goes up for ever and ever and they have no rest day and night who give worship to the beast and his image and have on them the mark of his name
 here is the quiet strength of the saints who keep the orders of god and the faith of jesus
 and a voice from heaven came to my ears saying put in writing there is a blessing on the dead who from now on come to their end in the lord yes says the spirit that they may have rest from their troubles for their works go with them
 and i saw a white cloud and on the cloud i saw one seated like a son of man having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp curved blade
 and another angel came out from the house of god crying with a loud voice to him who was seated on the cloud put in your blade and let the grain be cut because the hour for cutting it is come for the grain of the earth is over ready
 and he who was seated on the cloud sent in his blade on the earth and the grain of the earth was cut
 and another angel came out from the house of god which is in heaven having a sharp curved blade
 and another angel came out from the altar who has power over fire and he gave a loud cry to him who had the sharp curved blade saying put in your sharp blade and let the grapes of the vine of the earth be cut for her grapes are fully ready
 and the angel sent his blade into the earth and the vine of the earth was cut and he put it into the great wine crusher of the wrath of god
 and the grapes were crushed under foot outside the town and blood came out from them even to the head bands of the horses two hundred miles
 and i saw another sign in heaven great and strange seven angels having the seven last punishments for in them the wrath of god is complete
 and i saw a sea which seemed like glass mixed with fire and those who had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name were in their places by the sea of glass with gods instruments of music in their hands
 and they give the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and full of wonder are your works o lord god ruler of all true and full of righteousness are your ways eternal king
 what man is there who will not have fear before you o lord and give glory to your name because you only are holy for all the nations will come and give worship before you for your righteousness has been made clear
 and after these things i saw and the house of the tent of witness in heaven was open
 and the seven angels who had the seven punishments came out from the house of god clothed with linen clean and bright and with bands of gold about their breasts
 and one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven gold vessels full of the wrath of god who is living for ever and ever
 and the house of god was full of smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one was able to go into the house of god till the seven punishments of the seven angels were ended
 and a great voice out of the house of god came to my ears saying to the seven angels go and let that which is in the seven vessels of the wrath of god come down on the earth
 and the first went and let what was in his vessel come down on the earth and it became an evil poisoning wound on the men who had the mark of the beast and who gave worship to his image
 and the second let what was in his vessel come out into the sea and it became blood as of a dead man and every living thing in the sea came to an end
 and the third let what was in his vessel come out into the rivers and the fountains of water and they became blood
 and the voice of the angel of the waters came to my ears saying true and upright is your judging o holy one who is and was from all time
 for they made the blood of saints and prophets come out like a stream and blood have you given them for drink which is their right reward
 and a voice came from the altar saying even so o lord god ruler of all true and full of righteousness is your judging
 and the fourth let what was in his vessel come out on the sun and power was given to it that men might be burned with fire
 and men were burned with great heat and they said evil things against the name of the god who has authority over these punishments and they were not turned from their evil ways to give him glory
 and the fifth let what was in his vessel come out on the high seat of the beast and his kingdom was made dark and they were biting their tongues for pain
 and they said evil things against the god of heaven because of their pain and their wounds and they were not turned from their evil works
 and the sixth let what was in his vessel come out on the great river euphrates and it became dry so that the way might be made ready for the kings from the east
 and i saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet three unclean spirits like frogs
 for they are evil spirits working signs who go out even to the kings of all the earth to get them together to the war of the great day of god the ruler of all
  see i come as a thief happy is he who is watching and keeps his robes so that he may not go unclothed and his shame be seen 
 and they got them together into the place which is named in hebrew armageddon
 and the seventh let what was in his vessel come out on the air and there came out a great voice from the house of god from the high seat saying it is done
 and there were flames and voices and thunders and there was a great earth shock so that never from the time when men were on the earth had there been so great an earth shock so full of power
 and the great town was cut into three parts and the towns of the nations came to destruction and babylon the great came into mind before god to be given the cup of the wine of his wrath
 and every island went in flight and the mountains were seen no longer
 and great drops of ice every one about the weight of a talent came down out of heaven on men and men said evil things against god because of the punishment of the ice drops for it is very great
 and one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels came and said to me come here so that you may see the judging of the evil woman who is seated on the great waters
 with whom the kings of the earth made themselves unclean and those who are on the earth were full of the wine of her evil desires
 and he took me away in the spirit into a waste land and i saw a woman seated on a bright red beast full of evil names having seven heads and ten horns
 and the woman was clothed in purple and bright red with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels and in her hand was a gold cup full of evil things and her unclean desires
 and on her brow was a name secret babylon the great the mother of the evil women and of the unclean things of the earth
 and i saw the woman overcome as with the wine of the blood of the saints and the blood of those put to death because of jesus and when i saw her i was overcome with a great wonder
 and the angel said to me why were you surprised i will make clear to you the secret of the woman and of the beast on which she is seated which has the seven heads and the ten horns
 the beast which you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the great deep and to go into destruction and those who are on the earth whose names have not been put in the book of life from the first will be full of wonder when they see the beast that he was and is not and still will be
 here is the mind which has wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated
 and they are seven kings the five have come to an end the one is the other has not come and when he comes he will have to go on for a little time
 and the beast which was and is not is himself the eighth and is of the seven and he goes into destruction
 and the ten horns which you saw are ten kings which still have been given no kingdom but they are given authority as kings with the beast for one hour
 these have one mind and they give their power and authority to the beast
 these will make war against the lamb and the lamb will overcome them because he is the lord of lords and king of kings and those who are with him are named marked out and true
 and he said to me the waters which you saw where the evil woman is seated are peoples and armies and nations and languages
 and the ten horns which you saw and the beast these will be turned against the evil woman and will make her waste and uncovered and will take her flesh for food and will have her burned with fire
 because god has put it in their hearts to do his purpose and to be of one mind giving their kingdom to the beast till the words of god have effect and are complete
 and the woman whom you saw is the great town which is ruling over the kings of the earth
 after these things i saw another angel coming down out of heaven having great authority and the earth was bright with his glory
 and he gave a loud cry saying babylon the great has come down from her high place she has come to destruction and has become a place of evil spirits and of every unclean spirit and a hole for every unclean and hated bird
 for through the wine of the wrath of her evil desires all the nations have come to destruction and the kings of the earth made themselves unclean with her and the traders of the earth had their wealth increased by the power of her evil ways
 and another voice from heaven came to my ears saying come out of her my people so that you may have no part in her sins and in her punishments
 for her sins have gone up even to heaven and god has taken note of her evil doing
 give to her as she gave even an increased reward for her works in the cup which was mixed by her let there be mixed as much again for herself
 as she gave glory to herself and became more evil in her ways in the same measure give her pain and weeping for she says in her heart i am seated here a queen and am no widow and will in no way see sorrow
 for this reason in one day will her troubles come death and sorrow and need of food and she will be completely burned with fire for strong is the lord god who is her judge
 and the kings of the earth who made themselves unclean with her and in her company gave themselves up to evil will be weeping and crying over her when they see the smoke of her burning
 watching from far away for fear of her punishment saying sorrow sorrow for babylon the great town the strong town  for in one hour you have been judged
 and the traders of the earth are weeping and crying over her because no man has any more desire for their goods
 gold and silver and stones of great price and jewels and delicate linen and robes of purple and silk and red and perfumed wood and every vessel of ivory and every vessel made of fair wood and of brass and iron and stone
 and sweet smelling plants and perfumes and wine and oil and well crushed grain and cattle and sheep and horses and carriages and servants and souls of men
 and the fruit of your souls desire has gone from you and all things delicate and shining have come to an end and will never again be seen
 the traders in these things by which their wealth was increased will be watching far off for fear of her punishment weeping and crying
 saying sorrow sorrow for the great town she who was clothed in delicate linen and purple and red with ornaments of gold and stones of great price and jewels 
 for in one hour such great wealth has come to nothing and every shipmaster and all who are sailing on the sea and sailors and all who get their living by the sea were watching from far away
 and crying out when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what town is like the great town
 and they put dust on their heads and were sad weeping and crying and saying sorrow sorrow for the great town in which was increased the wealth of all who had their ships on the sea because of her great stores  for in one hour she is made waste
 be glad over her heaven and you saints and apostles and prophets because she has been judged by god on your account
 and a strong angel took up a stone like the great stone with which grain is crushed and sent it into the sea saying so with a great fall will babylon the great town come to destruction and will not be seen any more at all
 and the voice of players and makers of music will never again be sounding in you and no worker expert in art will ever again be living in you and there will be no sound of the crushing of grain any more at all in you
 and never again will the shining of lights be seen in you and the voice of the newly married man and the bride will never again be sounding in you for your traders were the lords of the earth and by your evil powers were all the nations turned out of the right way
 and in her was seen the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been put to death on the earth
 after these things there came to my ears a sound like the voice of a great band of people in heaven saying praise to the lord salvation and glory and power be to our god
 for true and upright are his decisions for by him has the evil woman been judged who made the earth unclean with the sins of her body and he has given her punishment for the blood of his servants
 and again they said praise to the lord and her smoke went up for ever and ever
 and the four and twenty rulers and the four beasts went down on their faces and gave worship to god who was seated on the high seat saying even so praise to the lord
 and a voice came from the high seat saying give praise to our god all you his servants small and great in whom is the fear of him
 and there came to my ears the voice of a great army like the sound of waters and the sound of loud thunders saying praise to the lord for the lord our god ruler of all is king
 let us be glad with delight and let us give glory to him because the time is come for the lamb to be married and his wife has made herself ready
 and to her it was given to be clothed in delicate linen clean and shining for the clean linen is the righteousness of the saints
 and he said to me put in the book happy are the guests at the bride feast of the lamb and he said to me these are the true words of god
 and i went on my face before his feet to give him worship and he said to me see you do it not i am a brother servant with you and with your brothers who keep the witness of jesus give worship to god for the witness of jesus is the spirit of the prophets word
 and the heaven was open and i saw a white horse and he who was seated on it was named certain and true and he is judging and making war in righteousness
 and his eyes are a flame of fire and crowns are on his head and he has a name in writing of which no man has knowledge but himself
 and he is clothed in a robe washed with blood and his name is the word of god
 and the armies which are in heaven went after him on white horses clothed in delicate linen white and clean
 and out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which he overcomes the nations and he has rule over them with a rod of iron and he is crushing with his feet the grapes of the strong wrath of god the ruler of all
 and on his robe and on his leg is a name king of kings and lord of lords
 and i saw an angel taking his place in the sun and he was crying with a loud voice saying to all the birds in flight in the heavens come together to the great feast of god
 so that you may take for your food the flesh of kings and of captains and of strong men and of horses and of those who are seated on them and the flesh of all men free and unfree small and great
 and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies come together to make war against him who was seated on the horse and against his army
 and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him by which they were turned from the true way who had the mark of the beast and who gave worship to his image these two were put living into the sea of ever burning fire
 and the rest were put to death with the sword of him who was on the horse even the sword which came out of his mouth and all the birds were made full with their flesh
 to the angel of the church in ephesus say these things says he who has the seven stars in his right hand who is walking in the middle of the seven gold lights
 i have knowledge of your doings and of your hard work and long waiting and that you will not put up with evil men and have put to the test those who say they are apostles and are not and have seen that they are false
 and you have the power of waiting and have undergone trouble because of my name without weariness
 but i have this against you that you are turned away from your first love
 so keep in mind where you were at first and be changed in heart and do the first works or i will come to you and will take away your light from its place if your hearts are not changed
 but at least you have the credit of hating the works of the nicolaitans as i do
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches to him who overcomes i will give of the fruit of the tree of life which is in the paradise of god
 and to the angel of the church in smyrna say these things says the first and the last who was dead and is living
 i have knowledge of your troubles and how poor you are  but you have true wealth  and the evil words of those who say they are jews and are not but are a synagogue of satan
 have no fear of the things which you will have to undergo see the evil one will send some of you into prison so that you may be put to the test and you will have great trouble for ten days be true till death and i will give you the crown of life
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches he who overcomes will not come under the power of the second death
 and to the angel of the church in pergamos say these things says he who has the sharp two edged sword
 i have knowledge that your living place is where satan has his seat and you are true to my name and were not turned away from your faith in me even in the days of antipas my true witness who was put to death among you where satan has his place
 but i have some things against you because you have with you those who keep the teaching of balaam by whose suggestion balak made the children of israel go out of the right way taking food which was offered to false gods and going after the desires of the flesh
 and you have those who keep the teaching of the nicolaitans
 see then that you have a change of heart or i will come to you quickly and will make war against them with the sword of my mouth
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches to him who overcomes i will give of the secret manna and i will give him a white stone and on the stone a new name of which no one has knowledge but he to whom it is given
 and to the angel of the church in thyatira say these things says the son of god whose eyes are like a flame of fire and his feet like polished brass
 i have knowledge of your works and your love and faith and help and strength in trouble and that your last works are more than the first
 but i have this against you that you let the woman jezebel say she is a prophet and give false teaching making my servants go after the desires of the flesh and take food offered to false gods
 and i gave her time for a change of heart but she has no mind to give up her unclean ways
 see i will put her into a bed and those who make themselves unclean with her into great trouble if they go on with her works
 and i will put her children to death and all the churches will see that i am he who makes search into the secret thoughts and hearts of men and i will give to every one of you the reward of your works
 but to you i say to the rest in thyatira even to those who have not this teaching and have no knowledge of the secrets of satan as they say i put on you no other weight
 but what you have keep safe till i come
 he who overcomes and keeps my works to the end to him i will give rule over the nations
 and he will be ruling them with a rod of iron as the vessels of the potter they will be broken even as i have power from my father
 and i will give him the morning star
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches
 and i saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key of the great deep and a great chain in his hand
 and he took the dragon the old snake which is the evil one and satan and put chains on him for a thousand years
 and put him into the great deep and it was shut and locked over him so that he might put the nations in error no longer till the thousand years were ended after this he will be let loose for a little time
 and i saw high seats and they were seated on them and the right of judging was given to them and i saw the souls of those who were put to death for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and those who did not give worship to the beast or to his image and had not his mark on their brows or on their hands and they were living and ruling with christ a thousand years
 the rest of the dead did not come to life again till the thousand years were ended this is the first coming back from the dead
 happy and holy is he who has a part in this first coming over these the second death has no authority but they will be priests of god and of christ and will be ruling with him a thousand years
 and when the thousand years are ended satan will be let loose out of his prison
 and will go out to put in error the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to get them together to the war the number of whom is like the sands of the sea
 and they went up over the face of the earth and made a circle about the tents of the saints and the well loved town and fire came down out of heaven for their destruction
 and the evil one who put them in error was sent down into the sea of ever burning fire where the beast and the false prophet are and their punishment will go on day and night for ever and ever
 and i saw a great white seat and him who was seated on it before whose face the earth and the heaven went in flight and there was no place for them
 and i saw the dead great and small taking their places before the high seat and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged by the things which were in the books even by their works
 and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man by his works
 and death and hell were put into the sea of fire this is the second death even the sea of fire
 and if anyones name was not in the book of life he went down into the sea of fire
 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were gone and there was no more sea
 and i saw the holy town new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god like a bride made beautiful for her husband
 and there came to my ears a great voice out of the high seat saying see the tent of god is with men and he will make his living place with them and they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god
 and he will put an end to all their weeping and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain for the first things have come to an end
 and he who is seated on the high seat said see i make all things new and he said put it in the book for these words are certain and true
 and he said to me it is done i am the first and the last the start and the end i will freely give of the fountain of the water of life to him who is in need
 he who overcomes will have these things for his heritage and i will be his god and he will be my son
 but those who are full of fear and without faith the unclean and takers of life those who do the sins of the flesh and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images and all those who are false will have their part in the sea of ever burning fire which is the second death
 and one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels in which were the seven last punishments came and said to me come here and see the bride the lambs wife
 and he took me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and let me see the holy town jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god
 having the glory of god and her light was like a stone of great price a jasper stone clear as glass
 she had a wall great and high with twelve doors and at the doors twelve angels and names on them which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel
 and on the east were three doors and on the north three doors and on the south three doors and on the west three doors
 and the wall of the town had twelve bases and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
 and he who was talking with me had a gold measuring rod to take the measure of the town and of its doors and its wall
 and the town is square as wide as it is long and he took the measure of the town with the rod one thousand and five hundred miles it is equally long and wide and high
 and he took the measure of its wall one hundred and forty four cubits after the measure of a man that is of an angel
 and the building of its wall was of jasper and the town was clear gold clear as glass
 the bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones the first base was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald
 the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth the twelfth amethyst
 and the twelve doors were twelve pearls every door was made of one pearl and the street of the town was clear gold as clear as glass
 and i saw no temple there because the lord god the ruler of all and the lamb are its temple
 and the town has no need of the sun or of the moon to give it light for the glory of god did make it light and the light of it is the lamb
 and the nations will go in its light and the kings of the earth will take their glory into it
 and the doors of it will never be shut by day  for there is no night there 
 and the glory and honour of the nations will come into it
 and nothing unclean may come into it or anyone whose works are cursed or false but only those whose names are in the lambs book of life
 and i saw a river of water of life clear as glass coming out of the high seat of god and of the lamb
 in the middle of its street and on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life having twelve sorts of fruits giving its fruit every month and the leaves of the tree give life to the nations
 and there will be no more curse and the high seat of god and of the lamb will be there and his servants will be worshipping him
 and they will see his face and his name will be on their brows
 and there will be no more night and they have no need of a light or of the shining of the sun for the lord god will give them light and they will be ruling for ever and ever
 and he said to me these words are certain and true and the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to make clear to his servants the things which are now to come about
 see i come quickly a blessing on him who keeps the words of this book of the prophet
 and i john am he who saw these things and to whose ears they came and when i had seen and given ear i went down on my face to give worship at the feet of the angel who made these things clear to me
 and he said to me see you do it not i am a brother servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and with those who keep the words of this book give worship to god
 and he said to me let not the words of this prophets book be kept secret because the time is near
 let the evil man go on in his evil and let the unclean be still unclean and let the upright go on in his righteousness and let the holy be holy still
 see i come quickly and my reward is with me to give to every man the outcome of his works
 i am the first and the last the start and the end
 a blessing on those whose robes are washed so that they may have a right to the tree of life and may go in by the doors into the town
 outside are the dogs and those who make use of evil powers those who make themselves unclean and the takers of l and to the angel of the church in sardis say these things says he who has the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i have knowledge of your works that you seem to be living but are dead
 be on the watch and make strong the rest of the things which are near to death because as judged by me your works have not come up to gods measure
 keep in mind then the teaching which was given to you and be ruled by it and have a change of heart if then you do not keep watch i will come like a thief and you will have no knowledge of the hour when i will come on you
 but you have some names in sardis who have kept clean their robes and as a reward they will go in white with me
 he who overcomes will be dressed in white and i will not take his name from the book of life and i will give witness to his name before my father and before his angels
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches
 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia say these things says he who is holy he who is true he who has the key of david opening the door so that it may be shut by no one and shutting it so that it may be open to no one
 i have knowledge of your works  see i have put before you an open door which may be shut by no one  and that you have a little strength and have kept my word and have been true to my name
 see i will make those of the synagogue of satan who say they are jews and are not but say what is false i will make them come and give worship before your feet and see my love for you
 because you have kept my word in quiet strength i will keep you from the hour of testing which is coming on all the world to put to the test those who are on earth
 i come quickly keep that which you have so that no one may take your crown
 him who overcomes i will make a pillar in the house of my god and he will go out no more and i will put on him the name of my god and the name of the town of my god the new jerusalem which comes down out of heaven from my god and my new name
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches
 and to the angel of the church in laodicea say these things says the true and certain witness the head of gods new order
 i have knowledge of your works that you are not cold or warm it would be better if you were cold or warm
 so because you are not one thing or the other i will have no more to do with you
 for you say i have wealth and have got together goods and land and have need of nothing and you are not conscious of your sad and unhappy condition that you are poor and blind and without clothing
 if you are wise you will get from me gold tested by fire so that you may have true wealth and white robes to put on so that your shame may not be seen and oil for your eyes so that you may see
 to all those who are dear to me i give sharp words and punishment then with all your heart have sorrow for your evil ways
 see i am waiting at the door and giving the sign if my voice comes to any mans ears and he makes the door open i will come in to him and will take food with him and he with me
 to him who overcomes i will give a place with me on my high seat even as i overcame and am seated with my father on his high seat
 he who has ears let him give ear to what the spirit says to the churches
 after these things i saw a door open in heaven and the first voice came to my ears like the sound of a horn saying come up here and i will make clear to you the things which are to come
 straight away i was in the spirit and i saw a high seat in heaven and one was seated on it
 and to my eyes he was like a jasper and a sardius stone and there was an arch of light round the high seat like an emerald
 and round about the high seat were four and twenty seats and on them i saw four and twenty rulers seated clothed in white robes and on their heads crowns of gold
 and out of the high seat came flames and voices and thunders and seven lights of fire were burning before the high seat which are the seven spirits of god
 and before the high seat there was as it seemed a clear sea of glass and in the middle of the high seat and round about it four beasts full of eyes round about
 and the first beast was like a lion and the second like an ox and the third had a face like a man and the fourth was like an eagle in flight
 and the four beasts having every one of them six wings are full of eyes round about and inside and without resting day and night they say holy holy holy lord god ruler of all who was and is and is to come
 and when the beasts give glory and honour to him who is seated on the high seat to him who is living for ever and ever
 the four and twenty rulers go down on their faces before him who is seated on the high seat and give worship to him who is living for ever and ever and take off their crowns before the high seat saying
 it is right our lord and our god for you to have glory and honour and power because by you were all things made and by your desire they came into being
 and i saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat a book with writing inside it and on the back shut with seven stamps of wax
 and i saw a strong angel saying in a loud voice who is able to make the book open and to undo its stamps
 and no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to get the book open or to see what was in it
 and i was very sad because there was no one able to get the book open or to see what was in it
 and one of the rulers said to me do not be sad see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has overcome and has power to undo the book and its seven stamps
 and i saw in the middle of the high seat and of the four beasts and in the middle of the rulers a lamb in his place which seemed as if it had been put to death having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth
 and he came and took it out of the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat
 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty rulers went down on their faces before the lamb having every one an instrument of music and gold vessels full of perfumes which are the prayers of the saints
 and their voices are sounding in a new song saying it is right for you to take the book and to make it open for you were put to death and have made an offering to god of your blood for men of every tribe and language and people and nation
 and have made them a kingdom and priests to our god and they are ruling on the earth
 and i saw and there came to my ears the sound of a great number of angels round about the high seat and the beasts and the rulers and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
 saying with a great voice it is right to give to the lamb who was put to death power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing
 and to my ears came the voice of everything in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and of all things which are in them saying to him who is seated on the high seat and to the lamb may blessing and honour and glory and power be given for ever and ever
 and the four beasts said so be it and the rulers went down on their faces and gave worship
 and i saw when the lamb undid one of the stamps and the voice of one of the four beasts came to my ears saying as with a voice of thunder come and see
 and i saw a white horse and he who was seated on it had a bow and there was given to him a crown and he went out with power to overcome
 and when the second stamp was undone the voice of the second beast came to my ears saying come and see
 and another horse came out a red horse and it was given to him who was seated on it to take peace from the earth so that people might put one another to death and there was given to him a great sword
 and when the third stamp was undone the voice of the third beast came to my ears saying come and see and i saw a black horse and he who was seated on it had scales in his hand
 and a voice came to my ears from the middle of the four beasts saying a measure of grain for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that you do no damage to the oil and the wine
 and when the fourth stamp was undone the voice of the fourth beast came to my ears saying come and see
 and i saw a grey horse and the name of him who was seated on it was death and hell came after him and there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth to put to destruction by the sword and by taking away their food and by death and by the beasts of the earth
 and when the fifth stamp was undone i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for the word of god and for the witness which they kept
 and they gave a great cry saying how long will it be o ruler holy and true before you take your place as judge and give punishment for our blood to those on the earth
 and there was given to every one a white robe and they were ordered to take their rest for a little time till the number was complete of the other servants their brothers who would be put to death even as they had been
 and i saw when the sixth stamp was undone and there was a great earth shock and the sun became black as haircloth and all the moon became as blood
 and the stars of heaven were falling to the earth like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind
 and the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places
 and the kings of the earth and the rulers and the chief captains and the men of wealth and the strong and every servant and free man took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains
 and they say to the mountains and to the rocks come down on us covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat and from the wrath of the lamb
 for the great day of their wrath is come and who may keep his place
 after this i saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth keeping back the four winds in their hands so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth or on the sea or on any tree
 and i saw another angel coming up from the east having the mark of the living god and he said with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to do damage to the earth and the sea
 do no damage to the earth or the sea or the trees till we have put a mark on the servants of our god
 and there came to my ears the number of those who had the mark on their brows a hundred and forty four thousand who were marked out of every tribe of the people of israel
 of the tribe of judah were marked twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben twelve thousand of the tribe of gad twelve thousand
 of the tribe of asher twelve thousand of the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand of the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand
 of the tribe of simeon twelve thousand of the tribe of levi twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar twelve thousand
 of the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin were marked twelve thousand
 after these things i saw a great army of people more than might be numbered out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and languages taking their places before the high seat and before the lamb dressed in white robes and with branches in their hands
 saying with a loud voice salvation to our god who is seated on the high seat and to the lamb
 and all the angels were round about the high seat and about the rulers and the four beasts and they went down on their faces before the high seat and gave worship to god saying
 so be it let blessing and glory and wisdom and praise and honour and power and strength be given to our god for ever and ever so be it
 and one of the rulers made answer saying to me these who have on white robes who are they and where did they come from
 and i said to him my lord you have knowledge and he said to me these are they who came through the great testing and their robes have been washed and made white in the blood of the lamb
 this is why they are before the high seat of god and they are his servants day and night in his house and he who is seated on the high seat will be a tent over them
 they will never be in need of food or drink and they will never again be troubled by the burning heat of the sun
 for the lamb who is on the high seat will be their keeper and their guide to fountains of living water and god will make glad their eyes for ever
 and when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour
 and i saw the seven angels who had their place before god and seven horns were given to them
 and another angel came and took his place at the altar having a gold vessel for burning perfume and there was given to him much perfume so that he might put it with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar which was before the high seat
 and the smoke of the perfume with the prayers of the saints went up before god out of the angels hand
 and the angel took the vessel and he made it full of the fire of the altar and sent it down on the earth and there came thunders and voices and flames and a shaking of the earth
 and the seven angels who had the seven horns made ready for sounding them
 and at the sounding of the first a rain of ice and fire mixed with blood was sent on the earth and a third part of the earth and of the trees and all green grass was burned up
 and at the sounding of the second angel it was as if a great mountain burning with fire was sent into the sea and a third part of the sea became blood
 and destruction came on a third part of the living things which were in the sea and on a third part of the ships
 and at the sounding of the third angel there went down from heaven a great star burning like a flame and it came on a third part of the rivers and on the fountains of water
 and the name of the star is wormwood and a third part of the waters became bitter and a number of men came to their end because of the waters for they were made bitter
 and at the sounding of the fourth angel a third part of the sun and of the moon and of the stars was made dark so that there was no light for a third part of the day and of the night
 and there came to my ears the cry of an eagle in flight in the middle of heaven saying with a great voice trouble trouble trouble to all on the earth because of the other voices of the horns of the three angels whose sounding is still to come
 and at the sounding of the fifth angel i saw a star falling from heaven to the earth and there was given to him the key of the great deep
 and he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it like the smoke of a great oven and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke
 and from the smoke locusts came out on the earth and power was given them like the power of scorpions
 and they were ordered to do no damage to the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree but only to such men as have not the mark of god on their brows
 and orders were given them not to put them to death but to give them great pain for five months and their pain was as the pain from the wound of a scorpion
 and in those days men will be hoping for death and it will not come to them and they will have a great desire for death and death will go in flight from them
 and the forms of the locusts were like horses made ready for war and on their heads they had crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men
 and they had hair like the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions
 and they had breastplates like iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages like an army of horses rushing to the fight
 and they have pointed tails like scorpions and in their tails is their power to give men wounds for five months
 they have over them as king the angel of the great deep his name in hebrew is abaddon and in the greek language apollyon
 the first trouble is past see there are still two troubles to come
 and at the sounding of the sixth angel a voice came to my ears from the horns of the gold altar which is before god
 saying to the sixth angel who had the horn make free the four angels who are chained at the great river euphrates
 and the four angels were made free who were ready for the hour and day and month and year that they might put to death a third part of men
 and the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand the number of them came to my ears
 and so i saw the horses in the vision and those who were seated on them having breastplates of fire and glass and of burning stone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and a smell of burning
 by these evils a third part of men was put to death by the fire and the smoke and the burning smell which came out of their mouths
 for the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails because their tails are like snakes and have heads and with them they give wounds
 and the rest of the people who were not put to death by these evils were not turned from the works of their hands but went on giving worship to evil spirits and images of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which have no power of seeing or hearing or walking
 and they had no regret for putting men to death or for their use of secret arts or for the evil desires of the flesh or for taking the property of others
 paul a servant of jesus christ an apostle by the selection of god given authority as a preacher of the good news
 of which god had given word before by his prophets in the holy writings
 about his son who in the flesh came from the family of david
 but was marked out as son of god in power by the holy spirit through the coming to life again of the dead jesus christ our lord
 through whom grace has been given to us sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations for his name
 among whom you in the same way have been marked out to be disciples of jesus christ
 to all those who are in rome loved by god marked out as saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 first of all i give praise to my god through jesus christ for you all because news of your faith has gone into all the world
 for god is my witness whose servant i am in spirit in the good news of his son that you are at all times in my memory and in my prayers
 and that i am ever making prayers that god will give me a good journey to you
 for i have a strong desire to see you and to give you some grace of the spirit so that you may be made strong
 that is to say that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me
 you may be certain my brothers that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you  but till now i was kept from it  so that i might have some fruit from you in the same way as i have had it from the other nations
 i have a debt to greeks and to the nations outside to the wise and to those who have no learning
 for which reason i have the desire as far as i am able to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in rome
 for i have no feeling of shame about the good news because it is the power of god giving salvation to everyone who has faith to the jew first and then to the greek
 for in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of god from faith to faith as it is said in the holy writings the man who does righteousness will be living by his faith
 for there is a revelation of the wrath of god from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing
 because the knowledge of god may be seen in them god having made it clear to them
 for from the first making of the world those things of god which the eye is unable to see that is his eternal power and existence are fully made clear he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made so that men have no reason for wrongdoing
 because having the knowledge of god they did not give glory to god as god and did not give praise but their minds were full of foolish things and their hearts being without sense were made dark
 seeming to be wise they were in fact foolish
 and by them the glory of the eternal god was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth
 for this reason god gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts working shame in their bodies with one another
 because by them the true word of god was changed into that which is false and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made and not to him who made it to whom be blessing for ever so be it
 for this reason god gave them up to evil passions and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural
 and in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another men doing shame with men and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil doing
 and because they had not the mind to keep god in their knowledge god gave them up to an evil mind to do those things which are not right
 being full of all wrongdoing evil desire for the goods of others hate envy putting to death fighting deceit cruel ways evil talk and false statements about others
 hated by god full of pride without respect full of loud talk given to evil inventions not honouring father or mother
 without knowledge not true to their undertakings unkind having no mercy
 who though they have knowledge of the law of god that the fate of those who do these things is death not only go on doing these things themselves but give approval to those who do them
 brothers my hearts desire and my prayer to god for them is that they may get salvation
 for i give witness of them that they have a strong desire for god but not with knowledge
 because not having knowledge of gods righteousness and desiring to give effect to their righteousness they have not put themselves under the righteousness of god
 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith
 for moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it
 but the righteousness which is of faith says these words say not in your heart who will go up to heaven  that is to make christ come down 
 or who will go down into the deep  that is to make christ come again from the dead 
 but what does it say the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith of which we are the preachers
 because if you say with your mouth that jesus is lord and have faith in your heart that god has made him come back from the dead you will have salvation
 for with the heart man has faith to get righteousness and with the mouth he says that jesus is lord to get salvation
 because it is said in the holy writings whoever has faith in him will not be shamed
 and the jew is not different from the greek for there is the same lord of all who is good to all who have hope in his name
 because whoever will give worship to the name of the lord will get salvation
 but how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news and how will they have news without a preacher
 and how will there be preachers if they are not sent as it is said how beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things
 but they have not all given ear to the good news for isaiah says lord who has had faith in our word
 so faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of christ
 but i say did not the word come to their ears yes certainly their sound has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world
 but i say had israel no knowledge first moses says you will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation and by a foolish people i will make you angry
 and isaiah says without fear those who were not searching for me made discovery of me and i was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me
 but about israel he says all the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away and who put themselves against my word
 so i say has god put his people on one side let there be no such thought for i am of israel of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
 god has not put away the people of his selection or have you no knowledge of what is said about elijah in the holy writings how he says words to god against israel
 lord they have put your prophets to death and made waste your altars and now i am the last and they are searching for me to take away my life
 but what answer does god make to him i have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to baal
 in the same way there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace
 but if it is of grace then it is no longer of works or grace would not be grace
 what then that which israel was searching for he did not get but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard
 as it was said in the holy writings god gave them a spirit of sleep eyes which might not see and ears which have no hearing to this day
 and david says let their table be made a net for taking them and a stone in their way and a punishment
 let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see and let their back be bent down at all times
 so i say were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall in no way but by their fall salvation has come to the gentiles so that they might be moved to envy
 now if their fall is the wealth of the world and their loss the wealth of the gentiles how much greater will be the glory when they are made full
 but i say to you gentiles in so far as i am the apostle of the gentiles i make much of my position
 if in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy so that some of them may get salvation by me
 for if by their putting away the rest of men have been made friends with god what will their coming back again be but life from the dead
 and if the first fruit is holy so is the mass and if the root is holy so are the branches
 but if some of the branches were broken off and you an olive tree of the fields were put in among them and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive tree is made fertile
 do not be uplifted in pride over the branches because it is not you who are the support of the root but it is by the root that you are supported
 you will say branches were broken off so that i might be put in
 truly because they had no faith they were broken off and you have your place by reason of your faith do not be lifted up in pride but have fear
 for if god did not have mercy on the natural branches he will not have mercy on you
 see then that god is good but his rules are fixed to those who were put away he was hard but to you he has been good on the condition that you keep in his mercy if not you will be cut off as they were
 and they if they do not go on without faith will be united to the tree again because god is able to put them in again
 for if you were cut out of a field olive tree and against the natural use were united to a good olive tree how much more will these the natural branches be united again with the olive tree which was theirs
 for it is my desire brothers that this secret may be clear to you so that you may not have pride in your knowledge that israel has been made hard in part till all the gentiles have come in
 and so all israel will get salvation as it is said in the holy writings there will come out of zion the one who makes free by him wrongdoing will be taken away from jacob
 and this is my agreement with them when i will take away their sins
 as far as the good news is in question they are cut off from god on account of you but as far as the selection is in question they are loved on account of the fathers
 because gods selection and his mercies may not be changed
 for as you in time past were not under the rule of god but now have got mercy through their turning away
 so in the same way these have gone against the orders of god so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy
 for god has let them all go against his orders so that he might have mercy on them all
 o how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of god  no one is able to make discovery of his decisions and his ways may not be searched out
 who has knowledge of the mind of the lord or who has taken part in his purposes
 or who has first given to him and it will be given back to him again
 for of him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory for ever so be it
 for this reason i make request to you brothers by the mercies of god that you will give your bodies as a living offering holy pleasing to god which is the worship it is right for you to give him
 and let not your behaviour be like that of this world but be changed and made new in mind so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of god
 but i say to every one of you through the grace given to me not to have an over high opinion of himself but to have wise thoughts as god has given to every one a measure of faith
 for as we have a number of parts in one body but all the parts have not the same use
 so we though we are a number of persons are one body in christ and are dependent on one another
 and having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us such as the quality of a prophet let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith
 or the position of a deacon of the church let a man give himself to it or he who has the power of teaching let him make use of it
 he who has the power of comforting let him do so he who gives let him give freely he who has the power of ruling let him do it with a serious mind he who has mercy on others let it be with joy
 let love be without deceit be haters of what is evil keep your minds fixed on what is good
 be kind to one another with a brothers love putting others before yourselves in honour
 be not slow in your work but be quick in spirit as the lords servants
 being glad in hope quiet in trouble at all times given to prayer
 giving to the needs of the saints ready to take people into your houses
 give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you
 take part in the joy of those who are glad and in the grief of those who are sorrowing
 be in harmony with one another do not have a high opinion of yourselves but be in agreement with common people do not give yourselves an air of wisdom
 do not give evil for evil to any man let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men
 as far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men
 do not give punishment for wrongs done to you dear brothers but give way to the wrath of god for it is said in the holy writings punishment is mine i will give reward says the lord
 but if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink give it to him for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head
 do not let evil overcome you but overcome evil by good
 let everyone put himself under the authority of the higher powers because there is no power which is not of god and all powers are ordered by god
 for which reason everyone who puts himself against the authority puts himself against the order of god and those who are against it will get punishment for themselves
 for rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil if you would have no fear of the authority do good and you will have praise
 for he is the servant of god to you for good but if you do evil have fear for the sword is not in his hand for nothing he is gods servant making gods punishment come on the evil doer
 so put yourselves under the authority not for fear of wrath but because you have the knowledge of what is right
 for the same reason make payment of taxes because the authority is gods servant to take care of such things at all times
 give to all what is their right taxes to him whose they are payment to him whose right it is fear to whom fear honour to whom honour is to be given
 be in debt for nothing but to have love for one another for he who has love for his neighbour has kept all the law
 and this do not be untrue in married life do not put to death do not take what is anothers do not have desire for what is anothers and if there is any other order it is covered by this word have love for your neighbour as for yourself
 love does no wrong to his neighbour so love makes the law complete
 see then that the time has come for you to be awake from sleep for now is your salvation nearer than when you first had faith
 the night is far gone and the day is near so let us put off the works of the dark arming ourselves with light
 with right behaviour as in the day not in pleasure making and drinking not in bad company and unclean behaviour not in fighting and envy
 but put on the lord jesus christ and do not give thought to the flesh to do its desires
 do not put on one side him who is feeble in faith and do not put him in doubt by your reasonings
 one man has faith to take all things as food another who is feeble in faith takes only green food
 let not him who takes food have a low opinion of him who does not and let not him who does not take food be a judge of him who does for he has gods approval
 who are you to make yourself a judge of another mans servant it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad yes his place will be safe because the lord is able to keep him from falling
 this man puts one day before another to that man they are the same let every man be certain in his mind
 he who keeps the day keeps it to the lord and he who takes food takes it as to the lord for he gives praise to god and he who does not take food to the lord he takes it not and gives praise to god
 for every mans life and every mans death has a relation to others as well as to himself
 as long as we have life we are living to the lord or if we give up our life it is to the lord so if we are living or if our life comes to an end we are the lords
 and for this purpose christ went into death and came back again that he might be the lord of the dead and of the living
 but you why do you make yourself your brothers judge or again why have you no respect for your brother because we will all have to take our place before god as our judge
 for it is said in the holy writings by my life says the lord to me every knee will be bent and every tongue will give worship to god
 so every one of us will have to give an account of himself to god
 then let us not be judges of one another any longer but keep this in mind that no man is to make it hard for his brother or give him cause for doubting
 i am conscious of this and am certain in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean for him it is unclean
 and if because of food your brother is troubled then you are no longer going on in the way of love do not let your food be destruction to him for whom christ went into death
 let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good
 for the kingdom of god is not food and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit
 and he who in these things is christs servant is pleasing to god and has the approval of men
 so then let us go after the things which make peace and the things by which we may be a help to one another
 do not let the work of god come to nothing on account of food all things are certainly clean but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another
 it is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother
 the faith which you have have it to yourself before god happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval
 but he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food because he does it not in faith and whatever is not of faith is sin
 we who are strong have to be a support to the feeble and not give pleasure to ourselves
 let every one of us give pleasure to his neighbour for his good to make him strong
 for christ did not give pleasure to himself but as it is said the bitter words of those who were angry with you came on me
 now those things which were put down in writing before our time were for our learning so that through quiet waiting and through the comfort of the holy writings we might have hope
 now may the god who gives comfort and strength in waiting make you of the same mind with one another in harmony with christ jesus
 so that with one mouth you may give glory to the god and father of our lord jesus christ
 so then take one another to your hearts as christ took us to the glory of god
 now i say that christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by god to the fathers
 and so that the gentiles might give glory to god for his mercy as it is said for this reason i will give praise to you among the gentiles and i will make a song to your name
 and again he says take part you gentiles in the joy of his people
 and again give praise to the lord all you gentiles and let all the nations give praise to him
 and again isaiah says there will be the root of jesse and he who comes to be the ruler over the gentiles in him will the gentiles put their hope
 now may the god of hope make you full of joy and peace through faith so that all hope may be yours in the power of the holy spirit
 and i myself am certain of you brothers that you are full of what is good complete in all knowledge able to give direction to one another
 but i have in some measure less fear in writing to you to put these things before you again because of the grace which was given to me by god
 to be a servant of christ jesus to the gentiles doing the work of a priest in the good news of god so that the offering of the gentiles might be pleasing to god being made holy by the holy spirit
 so i have pride in christ jesus in the things which are gods
 and i will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which christ has done by me to put the gentiles under his rule in word and in act
 by signs and wonders in the power of the holy spirit so that from jerusalem and round about as far as illyricum i have given all the good news of christ
 making it my purpose not to take the good news where christ was named so that my work might not be resting on that of others
 but as it is said in the holy writings they will see to whom the news of him had not been given and those to whose ears it had not come will have knowledge
 for which reason i was frequently kept from coming to you
 but now having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you
 whenever i go to spain  for it is my hope to see you on my way and to be sent on there by you if first i may in some measure have been comforted by your company   
 but now i go to jerusalem taking help for the saints
 for it has been the good pleasure of those of macedonia and achaia to send a certain amount of money for the poor among the saints at jerusalem
 yes it has been their good pleasure and they are in their debt for if the gentiles have had a part in the things of the spirit which were theirs it is right for them in the same way to give them help in the things of the flesh
 so when i have done this and have given them this fruit of love i will go on by you into spain
 and i am certain that when i come i will be full of the blessing of christ
 now i make request to you brothers by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit that you will be working together with me in your prayers to god for me
 so that i may be kept safe from those in judaea who have not put themselves under the rule of god and that the help which i am taking for jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints
 so that i may come to you in joy by the good pleasure of god and have rest with you
 now may the god of peace be with you all so be it
 it is my desire to say a good word for phoebe who is a servant of the church in cenchreae
 that you will take her in kindly after the way of the saints as one who is the lords and give her help in anything in which she may have need of you because she has been a help to a great number and to myself
 give my love to prisca and aquila workers with me in christ jesus
 who for my life put their necks in danger to whom not only i but all the churches of the gentiles are in debt
 and say a kind word to the church which is in their house give my love to my dear epaenetus who is the first fruit of asia to christ
 give my love to mary who gave much care to you
 give my love to andronicus and junia my relations who were in prison with me who are noted among the apostles and who were in christ before me
 give my love to ampliatus who is dear to me in the lord
 give my love to urbanus a worker in christ with us and to my dear stachys
 give my love to apelles who has the approval of christ say a kind word to those who are of the house of aristobulus
 give my love to herodion my relation say a kind word to those of the house of narcissus who are in the lord
 give my love to tryphaena and tryphosa workers in the lord give my love to my dear persis who did much work in the lord
 give my love to rufus one of the lords selection and to his mother and mine
 give my love to asyncritus phlegon hermes patrobas hermas and the brothers who are with them
 give my love to philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints who are with them
 give one another a holy kiss all the churches of christ send their love to you
 now it is my desire brothers that you will take note of those who are causing division and trouble among you quite against the teaching which was given to you and keep away from them
 for such people are not servants of the lord christ but of their stomachs and by their smooth and well said words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked
 for all have knowledge of how you do what you are ordered for this reason i have joy in you but it is my desire that you may be wise in what is good and without knowledge of evil
 and the god of peace will be crushing satan under your feet before long the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
 timothy who is working with me sends his love to you so do lucius and jason and sosipater my relations
 i tertius who have done the writing of this letter send love in the lord
 gaius with whom i am living whose house is open to all the church sends his love so does erastus the manager of the accounts of the town and quartus the brother
   
 now to him who is able to make you strong in agreement with the good news which i gave you and the preaching of jesus christ in the light of the revelation of that secret which has been kept through times eternal
 but is now made clear and by the writings of the prophets by the order of the eternal god the knowledge of it has been given to all the nations so that they may come under the rule of the faith
 to the only wise god through jesus christ be the glory for ever so be it
 so you have no reason whoever you are for judging for in judging another you are judging yourself for you do the same things
 and we are conscious that god is a true judge against those who do such things
 but you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself are you hoping that gods decision will not take effect against you
 or is it nothing to you that god had pity on you waiting and putting up with you for so long not seeing that in his pity gods desire is to give you a change of heart
 but by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of gods judging in righteousness
 who will give to every man his right reward
 to those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death he will give eternal life
 but to those who from a love of competition are not guided by what is true will come the heat of his wrath
 trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil to the jew first and then to the greek
 but glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good to the jew first and then to the greek
 for one man is not different from another before god
 all those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law
 for it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before god but only the doers
 for when the gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law they are a law to themselves
 because the work of the law is seen in their hearts their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval
 in the day when god will be a judge of the secrets of men as it says in the good news of which i am a preacher through jesus christ
 but as for you who have the name of jew and are resting on the law and take pride in god
 and have knowledge of his desires and are a judge of the things which are different having the learning of the law
 in the belief that you are a guide to the blind a light to those in the dark
 a teacher of the foolish having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true
 you who give teaching to others do you give it to yourself you who say that a man may not take what is not his do you take what is not yours
 you who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife are you true to yours you who are a hater of images do you do wrong to the house of god
 you who take pride in the law are you doing wrong to the honour of god by behaviour which is against the law
 for the name of god is shamed among the gentiles because of you as it is said in the holy writings
 it is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not
 if those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law will it not be credited to them as circumcision
 and they by their keeping of the law without circumcision will be judges of you by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision
 the true jew is not one who is only so publicly and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh
 but he is a jew who is a secret one whose circumcision is of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not from men but from god
 how then is the jew better off or what profit is there in circumcision
 much in every way first of all because the words of god were given to them
 and if some have no faith will that make the faith of god without effect
 in no way but let god be true though every man is seen to be untrue as it is said in the writings that your words may be seen to be true and you may be seen to be right when you are judged
 but if the righteousness of god is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said is it wrong for god to be angry  as men may say 
 in no way because if it is so how is god able to be the judge of all the world
 but if because i am untrue god being seen to be true gets more glory why am i to be judged as a sinner
 let us not do evil so that good may come  a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made  because such behaviour will have its right punishment
 what then are we worse off than they in no way because we have before made it clear that jews as well as greeks are all under the power of sin
 as it is said in the holy writings there is not one who does righteousness
 not one who has the knowledge of what is right not one who is a searcher after god
 they have all gone out of the way there is no profit in any of them there is not one who does good not so much as one
 their throat is like an open place of death with their tongues they have said what is not true the poison of snakes is under their lips
 whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words
 their feet are quick in running after blood
 destruction and trouble are in their ways
 and of the way of peace they have no knowledge
 there is no fear of god before their eyes
 now we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law so that every mouth may be stopped and all men may be judged by god
 because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes for through the law comes the knowledge of sin
 but now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of god to which witness is given by the law and the prophets
 that is the righteousness of god through faith in jesus christ to all those who have faith and one man is not different from another
 for all have done wrong and are far from the glory of god
 and they may have righteousness put to their credit freely by his grace through the salvation which is in christ jesus
 whom god has put forward as the sign of his mercy through faith by his blood to make clear his righteousness when in his pity god let the sins of earlier times go without punishment
 and to make clear his righteousness now so that he might himself be upright and give righteousness to him who has faith in jesus
 what reason then is there for pride it is shut out by what sort of law of works no but by a law of faith
 for this reason then a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law
 or is god the god of jews only is he not in the same way the god of gentiles yes of gentiles
 if god is one and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision and through faith to those who have not circumcision
 do we then through faith make the law of no effect in no way but we make it clear that the law is important
 what then may we say that abraham our father after the flesh has got
 for if abraham got righteousness by works he has reason for pride but not before god
 but what does it say in the holy writings and abraham had faith in god and it was put to his account as righteousness
 now the reward is credited to him who does works not as of grace but as a debt
 but to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil doer his faith is put to his account as righteousness
 as david says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account god puts righteousness without works saying
 happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing and whose sins are covered
 happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the lord
 is this blessing then for the circumcision only or in the same way for those who have not circumcision for we say that the faith of abraham was put to his account as righteousness
 how then was it judged when he had circumcision or when he had it not not when he had it but when he did not have it
 and he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision so that he might be the father of all those who have faith though they have not circumcision and so that righteousness might be put to their account
 and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision but who keep to the way of that faith which our father abraham had before he underwent circumcision
 for gods word that the earth would be his heritage was given to abraham not through the law but through the righteousness of faith
 for if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage then faith is made of no use and the word of god has no power
 for the outcome of the law is wrath but where there is no law it will not be broken
 for this reason it is of faith so that it may be through grace and so that the word of god may be certain to all the seed not only to that which is of the law but to that which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all
  as it is said in the holy writings i have made you a father of a number of nations  before him in whom he had faith that is god who gives life to the dead and to whom the things which are not are as if they were
 who without reason for hope in faith went on hoping so that he became the father of a number of nations as it had been said so will your seed be
 and not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead  he being about a hundred years old  and sarah was no longer able to have children
 still he did not give up faith in the undertaking of god but was made strong by faith giving glory to god
 and being certain that god was able to keep his word
 for which reason it was put to his account as righteousness
 now it was not because of him only that this was said
 but for us in addition to whose account it will be put if we have faith in him who made jesus our lord come back again from the dead
 who was put to death for our evil doing and came to life again so that we might have righteousness
 for which reason because we have righteousness through faith let us be at peace with god through our lord jesus christ
 through whom in the same way we have been able by faith to come to this grace in which we now are and let us have joy in hope of the glory of god
 and not only so but let us have joy in our troubles in the knowledge that trouble gives us the power of waiting
 and waiting gives experience and experience hope
 and hope does not put to shame because our hearts are full of the love of god through the holy spirit which is given to us
 for when we were still without strength at the right time christ gave his life for evil doers
 now it is hard for anyone to give his life even for an upright man though it might be that for a good man someone would give his life
 but god has made clear his love to us in that when we were still sinners christ gave his life for us
 much more if we now have righteousness by his blood will salvation from the wrath of god come to us through him
 for if when we were haters of god the death of his son made us at peace with him much more now that we are his friends will we have salvation through his life
 and not only so but we have joy in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we are now at peace with god
 for this reason as through one man sin came into the world and death because of sin and so death came to all men because all have done evil
 because till the law came sin was in existence but sin is not put to the account of anyone when there is no law to be broken
 but still death had power from adam till moses even over those who had not done wrong like adam who is a picture of him who was to come
 but the free giving of god is not like the wrongdoing of man for if by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men much more did the grace of god and the free giving by the grace of one man jesus christ come to men
 and the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one for the effect of one mans sin was punishment by the decision of god but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number
 for if by the wrongdoing of one death was ruling through the one much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness be ruling in life through the one even jesus christ
 so then as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men
 because as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of god by one man
 and the law came in addition to make wrongdoing worse but where there was much sin there was much more grace
 that as sin had power in death so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through jesus christ our lord
 what may we say then are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace
 in no way how may we who are dead to sin be living in it any longer
 or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into christ jesus had baptism into his death
 we have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death so that as christ came again from the dead by the glory of the father we in the same way might be living in new life
 for if we have been made like him in his death we will in the same way be like him in his coming to life again
 being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him so that the body of sin might be put away and we might no longer be servants to sin
 because he who is dead is free from sin
 but if we are dead with christ we have faith that we will be living with him
 having knowledge that because christ has come back from the dead he will never again go down to the dead death has no more power over him
 for his death was a death to sin but his life now is a life which he is living to god
 even so see yourselves as dead to sin but living to god in christ jesus
 for this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death so that you give way to its desires
 and do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing but give yourselves to god as those who are living from the dead and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to god
 for sin may not have rule over you because you are not under law but under grace
 what then are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace let it not be so
 are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire if to sin the end being death or if to do the desire of god the end being righteousness
 but praise be to god that though you were the servants of sin you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed
 and being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness
 i am using words in the way of men because your flesh is feeble as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean and to evil to do evil so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy
 when you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness
 what fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you for the end of such things is death
 but now being free from sin and having been made servants to god you have your fruit in that which is holy and the end is eternal life
 for the reward of sin is death but what god freely gives is eternal life in jesus christ our lord
 is it not clear my brothers  i am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law  that the law has power over a man as long as he is living
 for the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living but if her husband is dead she is free from the law of the husband
 so if while the husband is living she is joined to another man she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband but if the husband is dead she is free from the law so that she is not untrue even if she takes another man
 in the same way my brothers you were made dead to the law through the body of christ so that you might be joined to another even to him who came again from the dead so that we might give fruit to god
 for when we were in the flesh the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death
 but now we are free from the law having been made dead to that which had power over us so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit not in the old way of the letter
 what then is to be said is the law sin in no way but i would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law for i would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said you may not have a desire for what is anothers
 but sin taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law was working in me every form of desire because without the law sin is dead
 and there was a time when i was living without the law but when the law gave its orders sin came to life and put me to death
 and i made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death
 for i was tricked and put to death by sin which took its chance through the law
 but the law is holy and its orders are holy upright and good
 was then that which is good death to me in no way but the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil
 for we are conscious that the law is of the spirit but i am of the flesh given into the power of sin
 and i have no clear knowledge of what i am doing for that which i have a mind to do i do not but what i have hate for that i do
 but if i do that which i have no mind to do i am in agreement with the law that the law is good
 so it is no longer i who do it but the sin living in me
 for i am conscious that in me that is in my flesh there is nothing good i have the mind but not the power to do what is right
 for the good which i have a mind to do i do not but the evil which i have no mind to do that i do
 but if i do what i have no mind to do it is no longer i who do it but the sin living in me
 so i see a law that though i have a mind to do good evil is present in me
 in my heart i take pleasure in the law of god
 but i see another law in my body working against the law of my mind and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh
 how unhappy am i  who will make me free from the body of this death
 i give praise to god through jesus christ our lord so with my mind i am a servant to the law of god but with my flesh to the law of sin
 for this cause those who are in christ jesus will not be judged as sinners
 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death
 for what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh god sending his son in the image of the evil flesh and as an offering for sin gave his decision against sin in the flesh
 so that what was ordered by the law might be done in us who are living not in the way of the flesh but in the way of the spirit
 for those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh but those who go in the way of the spirit to the things of the spirit
 for the mind of the flesh is death but the mind of the spirit is life and peace
 because the mind of the flesh is opposite to god it is not under the law of god and is not able to be
 so that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to god
 you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if the spirit of god is in you but if any man has not the spirit of christ he is not one of his
 and if christ is in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness
 but if the spirit of him who made jesus come again from the dead is in you he who made christ jesus come again from the dead will in the same way through his spirit which is in you give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death
 so then my brothers we are in debt not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh
 for if you go in the way of the flesh death will come on you but if by the spirit you put to death the works of the body you will have life
 and all those who are guided by the spirit of god are sons of god
 for you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear but the spirit of sons was given to you by which we say abba father
 the spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of god
 and if we are children we have a right to a part in the heritage a part in the things of god together with christ so that if we have a part in his pain we will in the same way have a part in his glory
 i am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future
 for the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of god
 for every living thing was put under the power of change not by its desire but by him who made it so in hope
 that all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of god in glory
 for we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now
 and not only so but we who have the first fruits of the spirit even we have sorrow in our minds waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons that is the salvation of our bodies
 for our salvation is by hope but hope which is seen is not hope for who is hoping for what he sees
 but if we have hope for that which we see not then we will be able to go on waiting for it
 and in the same way the spirit is a help to our feeble hearts for we are not able to make prayer to god in the right way but the spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say
 and he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the spirit because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of god
 and we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for god and have been marked out by his purpose
 because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence were marked out by him to be made like his son so that he might be the first among a band of brothers
 and those who were marked out by him were named and those who were named were given righteousness and to those to whom he gave righteousness in the same way he gave glory
 what may we say about these things if god is for us who is against us
 he who did not keep back his only son but gave him up for us all will he not with him freely give us all things
 who will say anything against the saints of god it is god who makes us clear from evil
 who will give a decision against us it is christ jesus who not only was put to death but came again from the dead who is now at the right hand of god taking our part
 who will come between us and the love of christ will trouble or pain or cruel acts or the need of food or of clothing or danger or the sword
 as it is said in the holy writings because of you we are put to death every day we are like sheep ready for destruction
 but we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love
 for i am certain that not death or life or angels or rulers or things present or things to come or powers
 or things on high or things under the earth or anything which is made will be able to come between us and the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
 i say what is true in christ and not what is false my mind giving witness with me in the holy spirit
 that i am full of sorrow and pain without end
 for i have a desire to take on myself the curse for my brothers my family in the flesh
 who are israelites who have the place of sons and the glory and the agreements with god and the giving of the law and the worship and the hope offered by god
 whose are the fathers and of whom came christ in the flesh who is over all god to whom be blessing for ever so be it
 but it is not as if the word of god was without effect for they are not all israel who are of israel
 and they are not all children because they are the seed of abraham but in isaac will your seed be named
 that is it is not the children of the flesh but the children of gods undertaking who are named as the seed
 for this is the word of gods undertaking at this time will i come and sarah will have a son
 and not only so but rebecca being about to have a child by our father isaac  
 before the children had come into existence or had done anything good or bad in order that gods purpose and his selection might be effected not by works but by him whose purpose it is
 it was said to her the older will be the servant of the younger
 even as it is said i had love for jacob but for esau i had hate
 what may we say then is god not upright let it not be said
 for he says to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and pity on whom i will have pity
 so then it is not by the desire or by the attempt of man but by the mercy of god
 for the holy writings say to pharaoh for this same purpose did i put you on high so that i might make my power seen in you and that there might be knowledge of my name through all the earth
 so then at his pleasure he has mercy on a man and at his pleasure he makes the heart hard
 but you will say to me why does he still make us responsible who is able to go against his purpose
 but o man who are you to make answer against god may the thing which is made say to him who made it why did you make me so
 or has not the potter the right to make out of one part of his earth a vessel for honour and out of another a vessel for shame
 what if god desiring to let his wrath and his power be seen for a long time put up with the vessels of wrath which were ready for destruction
 and to make clear the wealth of his glory to vessels of mercy which he had before made ready for glory
 even us who were marked out by him not only from the jews but from the gentiles
 as he says in hosea they will be named my people who were not my people and she will be loved who was not loved
 and in the place where it was said to them you are not my people there they will be named the sons of the living god
 and isaiah says about israel even if the number of the children of israel is as the sand of the sea only a small part will get salvation
 for the lord will give effect to his word on the earth putting an end to it and cutting it short
 and as isaiah had said before if the lord of armies had not given us a seed we would have been like sodom and gomorrah
 what then may we say that the nations who did not go after righteousness have got righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith
 but israel going after a law of righteousness did not get it
 why because they were not searching for it by faith but by works they came up against the stone which was in the way
 as it is said see i am putting in zion a stone causing a fall and a rock in the way but he who has faith in him will not be put to shame
 paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ in agreement with the faith of the saints of god and the full knowledge of what is true in harmony with religion
 in the hope of eternal life which was made certain before eternal time by the word of god who is ever true
 who in his time made clear his word in the good news of which by the order of god our saviour i became a preacher
 to titus my true child in our common faith grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our saviour
 i did not take you with me when i went away from crete so that you might do what was necessary to put things in order there placing men in authority over the churches in every town as i said to you
 men having a good record husbands of one wife whose children are of the faith children of whom it may not be said that they are given to loose living or are uncontrolled
 for it is necessary for a bishop to be a man of virtue as gods servant not pushing himself forward not quickly moved to wrath or blows not desiring profit for himself
 but opening his house freely to guests a lover of what is good serious minded upright holy self controlled
 keeping to the true word of the teaching so that he may be able to give comfort by right teaching and overcome the arguments of the doubters
 for there are men who are not ruled by law foolish talkers false teachers specially those of the circumcision
 by whom some families have been completely overturned who take money for teaching things which are not right these will have to be stopped
 one of their prophets has said the men of crete are ever false evil beasts lovers of food hating work
 this witness is true so say sharp words to them so that they may come to the right faith
 giving no attention to the fictions of the jews and the rules of men who have no true knowledge
 to the clean in heart all things are clean but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean they become unclean in mind and in thought
 they say that they have knowledge of god while by their acts they are turning their backs on him they are hated by all hard hearted and judged to be without value for any good work
 but let your words be in agreement with true and right teaching
 that old men are to be simple in their tastes serious wise true in faith in love and of a quiet mind
 that old women are to be self respecting in behaviour not saying evil of others not given to taking much wine teachers of that which is good
 training the younger women to have love for their husbands and children
 to be wise in mind clean in heart kind working in their houses living under the authority of their husbands so that no evil may be said of the word of god
 to the young men give orders to be wise and serious minded
 in all things see that you are an example of good works holy in your teaching serious in behaviour
 saying true and right words against which no protest may be made so that he who is not on our side may be put to shame unable to say any evil of us
 servants are to be under the authority of their masters pleasing them in all things without argument
 not taking what is not theirs but giving clear signs of their good faith in all things doing credit to the teaching of god our saviour
 for the grace of god has come giving salvation to all men
 training us so that turning away from evil and the desires of this world we may be living wisely and uprightly in the knowledge of god in this present life
 looking for the glad hope the revelation of the glory of our great god and saviour jesus christ
 who gave himself for us so that he might make us free from all wrongdoing and make for himself a people clean in heart and on fire with good works
 on all these points give teaching and help and make clear what is right with all authority let all men give you honour
 make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities to do what they are ordered to be ready for every good work
 to say no evil of any man not to be fighters to give way to others to be gentle in behaviour to all men
 for in the past we were foolish hard in heart turned from the true way servants of evil desires and pleasures living in bad feeling and envy hated and hating one another
 but when the mercy of god our saviour and his love to man was seen
 not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves but in the measure of his mercy he gave us salvation through the washing of the new birth and the giving of new life in the holy spirit
 which he gave us freely through jesus christ our saviour
 so that having been given righteousness through grace we might have a part in the heritage the hope of eternal life
 this is a true saying and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things so that those who have had faith in god may give attention to good works these things are good and of profit to men
 but have nothing to do with foolish questionings and lists of generations and fights and arguments about the law for they are of no profit and foolish
 a man whose opinions are not those of the church after a first and second protest is to be kept out of your society
 clearly he is in error and a sinner being self judged
 when i send artemas or tychicus to you do your best to come to me at nicopolis for it is my purpose to be there for the winter
 send zenas the man of law and apollos on their journey with all care so that they may be in need of nothing
 and let our people go on with good works for necessary purposes so that they may not be without fruit
 all who are with me send you their love give our love to our friends in the faith grace be with you all
 paul and timothy servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus at philippi with the bishops and deacons of the church
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
 i give praise to my god at every memory of you
 and in all my prayers for you all making my request with joy
 because of your help in giving the good news from the first day till now
 for i am certain of this very thing that he by whom the good work was started in you will make it complete till the day of jesus christ
 so it is right for me to take thought for you all in this way because i have you in my heart for in my chains and in my arguments before the judges in support of the good news making clear that it is true you all have your part with me in grace
 for god is my witness how my love goes out to you all in the loving mercies of christ jesus
 and my prayer is that you may be increased more and more in knowledge and experience
 so that you may give your approval to the best things that you may be true and without wrongdoing till the day of christ
 being full of the fruits of righteousness which are through jesus christ to the glory and praise of god
 now it is my purpose to make clear to you brothers that the cause of the good news has been helped by my experiences
 so that it became clear through all the praetorium and to all the rest that i was a prisoner on account of christ
 and most of the brothers in the lord taking heart because of my chains are all the stronger to give the word of god without fear
 though some are preaching christ out of envy and competition others do it out of a good heart
 these do it from love conscious that i am responsible for the cause of the good news
 but those are preaching christ in a spirit of competition not from their hearts but with the purpose of giving me pain in my prison
 what then only that in every way falsely or truly the preaching of christ goes on and in this i am glad and will be glad
 for i am conscious that this will be for my salvation through your prayer and the giving out of the stored wealth of the spirit of jesus christ
 in the measure of my strong hope and belief that in nothing will i be put to shame but that without fear as at all times so now will christ have glory in my body by life or by death
 for to me life is christ and death is profit
 but if i go on living in the flesh  if this is the fruit of my work  then i do not see what decision to make
 i am in a hard position between the two having a desire to go away and be with christ which is very much better
 still to go on in the flesh is more necessary because of you
 and being certain of this i am conscious that i will go on yes and go on with you all for your growth and joy in the faith
 so that your pride in me may be increased in christ jesus through my being present with you again
 only let your behaviour do credit to the good news of christ so that if i come and see you or if i am away from you i may have news of you that you are strong in one spirit working together with one soul for the faith of the good news
 having no fear of those who are against you which is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation and that from god
 because to you it has been given in the cause of christ not only to have faith in him but to undergo pain on his account
 fighting the same fight which you saw in me and now have word of in me
 if then there is any comfort in christ any help given by love any uniting of hearts in the spirit any loving mercies and pity
 make my joy complete by being of the same mind having the same love being in harmony and of one mind
 doing nothing through envy or through pride but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself
 not looking everyone to his private good but keeping in mind the things of others
 let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus
 to whom though himself in the form of god it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like god
 but he made himself as nothing taking the form of a servant being made like men
 and being seen in form as a man he took the lowest place and let himself be put to death even the death of the cross
 for this reason god has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name
 so that at the name of jesus every knee may be bent of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld
 and that every tongue may give witness that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
 so then my loved ones as you have at all times done what i say not only when i am present but now much more when i am not with you give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts
 for it is god who is the cause of your desires and of your acts for his good pleasure
 do all things without protests and arguments
 so that you may be holy and gentle children of god without sin in a twisted and foolish generation among whom you are seen as lights in the world
 offering the word of life so that i may have glory in you in the day of christ because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect
 and even if i am offered like a drink offering giving myself for the cause and work of your faith i am glad and have joy with you all
 and in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy
 but i am hoping in the lord jesus to send timothy to you before long so that i may be comforted when i have news of you
 for i have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you
 for they all go after what is theirs not after the things of christ
 but his quality is clear to you how as a child is to its father so he was a help to me in the work of the good news
 him then i am hoping to send as quickly as possible when i am able to see how things will go for me
 but i have faith in the lord that i myself will come before long
 but it seemed to me necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight and your servant sent by you for help in my need
 because his heart was with you all and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill
 for in fact he was ill almost to death but god had mercy on him and not only on him but on me so that i might not have grief on grief
 i have sent him then the more gladly so that when you see him again you may be happy and i may have the less sorrow
 so take him to your hearts in the lord with all joy and give honour to such as he is
 because for the work of christ he was near to death putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete
 for the rest my brothers be glad in the lord writing the same things to you is no trouble to me and for you it is safe
 be on the watch against dogs against the workers of evil against those of the circumcision
 for we are the circumcision who give worship to god and have glory in jesus christ and have no faith in the flesh
 even though i myself might have faith in the flesh if any other man has reason to have faith in the flesh i have more
 being given circumcision on the eighth day of the nation of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of hebrews in relation to the law a pharisee
 in bitter hate i was cruel to the church i kept all the righteousness of the law to the last detail
 but those things which were profit to me i gave up for christ
 yes truly and i am ready to give up all things for the knowledge of christ jesus my lord which is more than all for whom i have undergone the loss of all things and to me they are less than nothing so that i may have christ as my reward
 and be seen in him not having my righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
 that i may have knowledge of him and of the power of his coming back from the dead and a part with him in his pains becoming like him in his death
 if in any way i may have the reward of life from the dead
 not as if i had even now got the reward or been made complete but i go on in the hope that i may come to the knowledge of that for which i was made the servant of christ jesus
 brothers it is clear to me that i have not come to that knowledge but one thing i do letting go those things which are past and stretching out to the things which are before
 i go forward to the mark even the reward of the high purpose of god in christ jesus
 then let us all who have come to full growth be of this mind and if in anything you are of a different mind even this will god make clear to you
 only as far as we have got let us be guided by the same rule
 brothers take me as your example and take note of those who are walking after the example we have given
 for there are those of whom i have given you word before and do so now with sorrow who are haters of the cross of christ
 whose end is destruction whose god is the stomach and whose glory is in their shame whose minds are fixed on the things of the earth
 for our country is in heaven from where the saviour for whom we are waiting will come even the lord jesus christ
 by whom this poor body of ours will be changed into the image of the body of his glory in the measure of the working by which he is able to put all things under himself
 so my brothers well loved and very dear to me my joy and crown be strong in the lord my loved ones
 i make request to euodias and syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord
 and i make request to you true helper in my work to see to the needs of those women who took part with me in the good news with clement and the rest of my brother workers whose names are in the book of life
 be glad in the lord at all times again i say be glad
 let your gentle behaviour be clear to all men the lord is near
 have no cares but in everything with prayer and praise put your requests before god
 and the peace of god which is deeper than all knowledge will keep your hearts and minds in christ jesus
 for the rest my brothers whatever things are true whatever things have honour whatever things are upright whatever things are holy whatever things are beautiful whatever things are of value if there is any virtue and if there is any praise give thought to these things
 the things which came to you by my teaching and preaching and which you saw in me these things do and the god of peace will be with you
 but i am very glad in the lord that your care for me has come to life again though you did in fact take thought for me but you were not able to give effect to it
 but i will not say anything about my needs for i am able wherever i am to be dependent on myself
 it is the same to me if i am looked down on or honoured everywhere and in all things i have the secret of how to be full and how to go without food how to have wealth and how to be in need
 i am able to do all things through him who gives me strength
 but you did well to have care for me in my need
 and you have knowledge philippians that when the good news first came to you when i went away from macedonia no church took part with me in the business of giving to the saints but you only
 because even in thessalonica you sent once and again to me in my need
 not that i am looking for an offering but for fruit which may be put to your credit
 i have all things and more than enough i am made full having had from epaphroditus the things which came from you a perfume of a sweet smell an offering well pleasing to god
 and my god will give you all you have need of from the wealth of his glory in christ jesus
 now to god our father be glory for ever and ever so be it
 give words of love to every saint in christ jesus the brothers who are with me send you their love
 all the saints send their love to you specially those who are of caesars house
 the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit

 now the philistines were fighting against israel and the men of israel went in flight before the philistines falling down wounded in mount gilboa
 and the philistines went hard after saul and his sons and put to death jonathan and abinadab and malchi shua the sons of saul
 and the fight was going against saul and the archers came across him and he was wounded by the archers
 then saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms take your sword and put it through me before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me but his servant full of fear would not do so then saul took out his sword falling on it himself
 and when his servant saw that saul was dead he did the same and came to his death
 so death overtook saul and his three sons all his family came to an end together
 and when all the men of israel who were in the valley saw that the men of israel had gone in flight and that saul and his sons were dead they went in flight away from their towns and the philistines came and took them for themselves
 now the day after when the philistines came to take their goods from the dead they saw saul and his sons dead in mount gilboa
 and they took everything off him and took his head and his war dress and sent word into the land of the philistines round about to give the news to their gods and to the people
 and they put his war dress in the house of their gods and put up his head in the house of dagon
 and when the news came to jabesh gilead of what the philistines had done to saul
 all the fighting men came up and took away sauls body and the bodies of his sons and took them to jabesh and put their bones to rest under the oak tree in jabesh and took no food for seven days
 so death came to saul because of the sin which he did against the lord that is because of the word of the lord which he kept not and because he went for directions to one who had an evil spirit
 and not to the lord for this reason he put him to death and gave the kingdom to david the son of jesse
 then all israel came together to david at hebron and said truly we are your bone and your flesh
 in the past when saul was king it was you who went at the head of israel when they went out or came in and the lord your god said to you you are to be the keeper of my people israel and their ruler
 so all the responsible men of israel came to the king at hebron and david made an agreement with them in hebron before the lord and they put the holy oil on david and made him king over israel as the lord had said by samuel
 then david and all israel went to jerusalem  which is jebus  and the jebusites the people of the land were there
 and the people of jebus said to david you will not come in here but still david took the strong place of zion which is the town of david
 and david said the first to overcome the jebusites will be chief and captain and joab the son of zeruiah went up first and became chief
 and david took the strong tower for his living place so it was named the town of david
 and he took in hand the building of the town all round starting from the millo and joab put the rest of the town in order
 and david became greater and greater in power because the lord of armies was with him
 now these are the chief of davids men of war who were his strong supporters in the kingdom and with all israel made him king as the lord had said about israel
 this is the list of davids men of war ishbaal the son of a hachmonite the chief of the three he put to death three hundred at one time with his spear
 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three great fighters
 he was with david at pas dammim where the philistines had come together for the fight near a bit of land full of barley and the people went in flight before the philistines
 and he took up his position in the middle of the bit of land and kept back their attack and overcame the philistines and the lord gave a great salvation
 and three of the thirty went down to david to the rock into the strong place of adullam and the army of the philistines had taken up their position in the valley of rephaim
 at that time david had taken cover in the strong place and an armed force of the philistines was in beth lehem
 and david moved by a strong desire said if only someone would give me a drink of the water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town 
 so the three forcing a way through the philistine army got water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town and took it back to david but david would not take it but made an offering of it draining it out to the lord
 saying by my god far be it from me to do this  how may i take as drink the life blood of these men who have put their lives in danger so he did not take it these things did the three great men of war
 and abishai the brother of joab was chief of the thirty for he put to death three hundred with his spear but he had not a name among the three
 of the thirty he was the noblest and was made their captain but he was not equal to the first three
 benaiah the son of jehoiada a fighting man of kabzeel had done great acts he put to death two young lions going into their secret place and he went down into a hole and put a lion to death in time of snow
 and he made an attack on an egyptian a very tall man about five cubits high armed with a spear like a cloth workers rod he went down to him with a stick and pulling his spear out of the hand of the egyptian put him to death with that same spear
 these were the acts of benaiah the son of jehoiada who had a great name among the thirty men of war
 he was honoured over the thirty but he was not equal to the first three and david put him over his servants
 and these were the great men of war asahel the brother of joab elhanan the son of dodo of beth lehem
 shammoth the harodite helez the pelonite
 ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite abiezer the anathothite
 sibbecai the hushathite ilai the ahohite
 maharai the netophathite heled the son of baanah the netophathite

 jediael the son of shimri and joha his brother the tizite
 eliel the mahavite and jeribai and joshaviah the sons of elnaam and ithmah the moabite
 eliel and obed and jaasiel the mezobaite
 now these are the men who came to david at ziklag while he was still shut up because of saul the son of kish they were among the strong men his helpers in war
 they were armed with bows and were able to send stones and arrows from the bow with right hand or left they were sauls brothers of benjamin
 ahiezer was their chief then joash the sons of shemaah the gibeathite and jeziel and pelet the sons of azmaveth and beracah and jehu the anathothite
 and ishmaiah the gibeonite a great man among the thirty and their chief and jeremiah and jehaziel and johanan and jozabad the gederathite
 eluzai and jerimoth and bealiah and shemariah and shephatiah the haruphite
 elkanah and isshiah and azarel and joezer and jashobeam the korahites
 and joelah and zebadiah the sons of jeroham of gedor
 and some of the gadites siding with david went to his strong place in the waste land great and strong men trained for war expert in the use of arms whose faces were like the faces of lions and they were quick footed like roes on the mountains
 ezer their chief obadiah the second eliab the third
 mishmannah the fourth jeremiah the fifth
 attai the sixth eliel the seventh
 johanan the eighth elzabad the ninth
 jeremiah the tenth machbannai the eleventh
 these gadites were captains of the army the least of them was captain over a hundred men and the greatest over a thousand
 it was they who went over jordan in the first month when the river was overflowing and put to flight all the people of the valleys to the east and to the west
 and some of the children of benjamin and judah came to david in his strong place
 and david went out to them and said to them if you have come in peace to give me help my heart will be united with yours but if you have come to give me up to those who would take my life though my hands are clean from wrongdoing then may the god of our fathers see it and give you punishment
 then the spirit came on amasai who was chief of the captains and he said we are yours david we are on your side o son of jesse may peace be with you and peace be with your helpers for god is your helper then david took them into his army and made them captains of the band
 and some of the men of manasseh came over to david when he went with the philistines to the war against saul but he gave them no help for the lords of the philistines after discussion sent him away saying he will go back to his master saul at the price of our lives
 then when he went back to ziklag there came over to him of the men of manasseh adnah and jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and zillethai captains of thousands from the armies of manasseh
 and they gave david help against the armed bands for they were all great men of war and captains in the army
 and from day to day more supporters came to david till he had a great army like the army of god
 these are the numbers of the chiefs of the armed men ready for war who came to david at hebron to give the kingdom of saul into his hands as the lord had said
 there were six thousand eight hundred spearmen of the children of judah armed for war
 seven thousand one hundred of the children of simeon great men of war
 of the children of levi four thousand six hundred
 and jehoiada chief of the family of aaron and with him three thousand seven hundred men
 and zadok a young man great and strong in war with twenty two captains from his fathers people
 and of the children of benjamin the brothers of saul three thousand for up to that time the greater part of them had been true to saul
 and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred great men of war men of great name in their families
 and from the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand listed by name came to make david king
 and of the children of issachar there were two hundred chiefs men who had expert knowledge of the times and what it was best for israel to do and all their brothers were under their orders
 of zebulun there were fifty thousand men who went out with the army expert in ordering the fight to give help with all sorts of arms true hearted men
 and of naphtali a thousand captains with thirty seven thousand spearmen
 and of the danites twenty eight thousand six hundred expert in ordering the fight
 and of asher forty thousand who went out with the army expert in ordering the fight
 from the other side of jordan there were a hundred and twenty thousand of the reubenites and the gadites and the men of the half tribe of manasseh armed with every sort of instrument of war
 all these men of war expert in ordering the fight came to hebron with the full purpose of making david king over all israel and all the rest of israel were united in their desire to make david king
 for three days they were there with david feasting at his table for their brothers had made ready food for them
 and those who were near as far as issachar and zebulun and naphtali came with food on asses and camels and mules and oxen with meal for food and cakes of figs and masses of grapes and wine and oil and oxen and sheep in great numbers for there was joy in israel
 then david had discussions with the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds and with every chief
 and david said to all the men of israel who had come together there if it seems good to you and if it is the purpose of the lord our god let us send to all the rest of our brothers everywhere in the land of israel and to the priests and the levites in their towns and the country round them and get them to come together here to us
 and let us get back for ourselves the ark of our god for in the days of saul we did not go to it for directions
 and all the people said they would do so for it seemed right to them
 so david sent for all israel to come together from shihor the river of egypt as far as the way into hamath to get the ark of god from kiriath jearim
 and david went up with all israel to baalah that is to kiriath jearim in judah to get up from there the ark of god over which the holy name is named the name of the lord whose place is between the winged ones
 and they put the ark of god on a new cart and took it out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio were the drivers of the cart
 then david and all israel made melody before god with all their strength with songs and corded instruments of music and with brass instruments and horns
 and when they came to the grain floor of chidon uzza put out his hand to keep the ark in its place for the oxen were slipping
 and the wrath of the lord burning against uzza sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark and death came to him there before god
 and david was angry because of the lords outburst of wrath against uzza and he gave that place the name perez uzza to this day
 and so great was davids fear of god that day that he said how may i let the ark of god come to me
 so david did not let the ark come back to him to the town of david but had it turned away and put into the house of obed edom the gittite
 and the ark of god was in the house of obed edom for three months and the lord sent a blessing on the house of obed edom and on all he had
 and hiram king of tyre sent men to david with cedar trees and stoneworkers and woodworkers for the building of his house
 and david saw that the lord had made his position safe as king over israel lifting up his kingdom on high because of his people israel
 and while he was living in jerusalem david took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters
 these are the names of the children he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon
 and ibhar and elishua and elpelet
 and nogah and nepheg and japhia
 and elishama and beeliada and eliphelet
 and when the philistines had news that david had been made king over all israel they went up in search of david and david hearing of it went out against them
 now the philistines had come and had gone out in every direction in the valley of rephaim
 and david desiring directions from god said am i to go up against the philistines and will you give them into my hands and the lord said go up for i will give them into your hands
 so they went up to baal perazim and david overcame them there and david said god has let the forces fighting against me be broken by my hand as a wall is broken down by rushing water so they gave that place the name of baal perazim
 and the philistines did not take their images with them in their flight and at davids orders they were burned with fire
 then the philistines again went out in every direction in the valley
 and david went for directions to god and god said to him you are not to go up after them but turning away from them come face to face with them opposite the spice trees
 and at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees go out to the fight for god has gone out before you to overcome the army of the philistines
 and david did as the lord had said and they overcame the army of the philistines attacking them from gibeon as far as gezer
 and davids name was honoured in all lands and the lord put the fear of him on all nations
 and david made houses for himself in the town of david and he got ready a place for the ark of god and put up a tent for it
 then david said the ark of god may not be moved by any but the levites for they have been marked out by god to take the ark of god and to do his work for ever
 and david made all israel come together at jerusalem to take the ark of the lord to its place which he had got ready for it
 and david got together the sons of aaron and the levites
 of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brothers a hundred and twenty
 of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred and twenty
 of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brothers a hundred and thirty
 of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brothers two hundred
 of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brothers eighty
 of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brothers a hundred and twelve
 and david sent for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab
 and said to them you are the heads of the families of the levites make yourselves holy you and your brothers so that you may take the ark of the lord the god of israel to the place which i have made ready for it
 for because you did not take it at the first the lord our god sent punishment on us because we did not get directions from him in the right way
 so the priests and the levites made themselves holy to take up the ark of the lord the god of israel
 and the sons of the levites took up the ark of god lifting it by its rods as the lord had said to moses
 and david gave orders to the chief of the levites to put their brothers the music makers in position with instruments of music corded instruments and brass with glad voices making sounds of joy
 so heman the son of joel and of his brothers asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brothers ethan the son of kushaiah were put in position by the levites
 and with them their brothers of the second order zechariah bani and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obed edom and jeiel the door keepers
 so those who made melody heman asaph and ethan were put in position with brass instruments sounding loudly
 and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with corded instruments put to alamoth
 and mattithiah and eliphelehu and mikneiah and obed edom and jeiel and azaziah with corded instruments on the octave to give the first note of the song
 and chenaniah chief of the levites was master of the music he gave directions about the song because he was expert
 and berechiah and elkanah were door keepers for the ark
 and shebaniah and joshaphat and nethanel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests made music on the horns before the ark of god and obed edom and jehiah were door keepers for the ark
 so david and the responsible men of israel and the captains over thousands went with joy to get the ark of the agreement of the lord out of the house of obed edom
 and when god gave help to the levites who were lifting up the ark of the agreement of the lord they made an offering of seven oxen and seven sheep
 and david was clothed with a robe of fair linen as were all the levites who took up the ark and those who made melody and chenaniah the master of those who made melody and david had on a linen ephod
 so all israel took up the ark of the agreement of the lord with loud cries and with horns and brass and corded instruments sounding loudly
 and when the ark of the agreement of the lord came into the town of david michal the daughter of saul looking out of the window saw king david dancing and playing and to her mind he seemed foolish
 then they took in the ark of god and put it inside the tent which david had put up for it and they made offerings burned offerings and peace offerings before god
 and when david had come to an end of making the burned offerings and peace offerings he gave the people a blessing in the name of the lord
 and he gave to everyone every man and woman of israel a cake of bread some meat and a cake of dry grapes
 and he put some of the levites before the ark of the lord as servants to keep the acts of the lord in memory and to give worship and praise to the lord the god of israel
 asaph the chief and second to him zechariah uzziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obed edom and jeiel with corded instruments of music and asaph with brass instruments sounding loudly
 and benaiah and jahaziel the priests blowing horns all the time before the ark of the agreement of god
 then on that day david first made the giving of praise to the lord the work of asaph and his brothers
 o give praise to the lord give honour to his name talking of his doings among the peoples
 let your voice be sounded in songs and melody let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works
 have glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who are searching after the lord be glad
 let your search be for the lord and for his strength let your hearts ever be turned to him
 keep in mind the great works which he has done his wonders and the decisions of his mouth
 o you seed of israel his servant you children of jacob his loved ones
 he is the lord our god he is judge of all the earth
 he has kept his agreement in mind for ever the word which he gave for a thousand generations
 the agreement which he made with abraham and his oath to isaac
 and he gave it to jacob for a law and to israel for an eternal agreement
 saying to you will i give the land of canaan the measured line of your heritage
 when you were still small in number and strange in the land
 when they went about from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people
 he would not let anyone do them wrong he even kept back kings because of them
 saying put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil and do my prophets no wrong
 make songs to the lord all the earth give the good news of his salvation day by day
 make clear his glory to the nations and his wonders to all the peoples
 for the lord is great and greatly to be praised and he is more to be feared than all other gods
 for all the gods of the nations are false gods but the lord made the heavens
 honour and glory are before him strength and joy are in his holy place
 give to the lord o you families of the peoples give to the lord glory and strength
 give to the lord the glory of his name take with you an offering and come before him give worship to the lord in holy robes
 be in fear before him all the earth the world is ordered so that it may not be moved
 let the heavens have joy and let the earth be glad let them say among the nations the lord is king
 let the sea be thundering with all its waters let the field be glad and everything which is in it
 then let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy before the lord for he is come to be the judge of the earth
 o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and say be our saviour o god of our salvation and let us come back and give us salvation from the nations so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise
 praise be to the lord the god of israel for ever and for ever and all the people said so be it and gave praise to the lord
 so he made asaph and his brothers keep their places there before the ark of the agreement of the lord to do whatever had to be done before the ark at all times day by day
 and obed edom the son of jeduthun and hosah with their brothers sixty eight of them to be door keepers
 and zadok the priest with his brothers the priests before the house of the lord in the high place at gibeon
 to give burned offerings to the lord on the altar of burned offerings morning and evening every day as it is ordered in the law of the lord which he gave to israel
 and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest who were marked out by name to give praise to the lord for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and heman and jeduthun had horns and brass instruments sounding loudly and instruments of music for the songs of god and the sons of jeduthun were to be at the door
 and all the people went away every man to his house and david went back to give a blessing to his family
 now when david was living in his house he said to nathan the prophet see i am living in a house of cedar wood but the ark of the lords agreement is under the curtains of a tent
 and nathan said to david do whatever is in your heart for god is with you
 but that same night the word of god came to nathan saying
 go and say to david my servant the lord says you are not to make me a house for my living place
 for from the day when i took israel up till this day i have had no house but have gone from tent to tent and from living place to living place
 in all the places where i have gone with all israel did i ever say to any of the judges of israel whom i made the keepers of my people why have you not made for me a house of cedar
 so now say to my servant david the lord of armies says i took you from the fields from keeping sheep so that you might be a ruler over my people israel
 and i have been with you wherever you went cutting off before you all those who were against you and i will make your name like the name of the greatest ones of the earth
 and i will make a resting place for my people israel planting them there so that they may be in the place which is theirs and never again be moved and never again will they be made waste by evil men as they were at first
 from the time when i put judges over my people israel and i will overcome all those who are against you and i will make you great and the head of a line of kings
 and when the time comes for you to go to your fathers i will put in your place your seed after you one of your sons and i will make his kingdom strong
 he will be the builder of my house and i will make the seat of his authority certain for ever
 i will be to him a father and he will be to me a son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him who was before you
 but i will make his place in my house and in my kingdom certain for ever and the seat of his authority will never be overturned
 so nathan gave david an account of all these words and this vision
 then david the king went in and took his seat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is my family that you have been my guide till now
 and this was only a small thing to you o god but your words have even been about the far off future of your servants family looking on me as on one of high position o lord god
 what more may david say to you for you have knowledge of your servant
 o lord because of your servant and from your heart you have done all these great things and let them be seen
 o lord there is no one like you and no other god but you as is clear from everything which has come to our ears
 and what other nation in the earth like your people israel did a god go out to take for himself to be his people making his name great and to be feared driving out the nations from before your people whom you made free and took out of egypt
 for your people israel you made yours for ever and you lord became their god
 and now lord let your words about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever and do as you have said
 so let your words be made certain and your name be made great when men say the lord of armies is the god of israel and when the family of david your servant is made strong before you
 for you o my god have let your servant see that you will make him head of a line of kings and so it has come into your servants heart to make his prayer to you
 and now o lord you are god and you have said you will give this good thing to your servant
 and now you have been pleased to give your blessing to the family of your servant so that it may go on for ever before you you o lord have given your blessing and a blessing will be on it for ever
 and it came about after this that david made an attack on the philistines and overcame them and took gath with its daughter towns out of the hands of the philistines
 and he overcame moab and the moabites became his servants and gave him offerings
 then david overcame hadadezer king of zobah near hamath when he was going to make his power seen by the river euphrates
 and david took from him a thousand war carriages and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and he had the leg muscles of all the horses cut keeping only enough of them for a hundred war carriages
 and when the aramaeans of damascus came to the help of hadadezer king of zobah david put to the sword twenty two thousand aramaeans
 then david put armed forces in damascus and the aramaeans became his servants and gave him offerings and the lord made david overcome wherever he went
 and the gold body covers of the servants of hadadezer david took to jerusalem
 and from tibhath and from cun towns of hadadezer david took a great store of brass of which solomon made the great brass water vessel and the brass pillars and vessels
 now when tou king of hamath had news that david had overcome all the army of hadadezer king of zobah
 he sent his son hadoram to king david to give him words of peace and blessing because he had overcome hadadezer in the fight for hadadezer had been at war with tou and he gave him all sorts of vessels of gold and silver and brass
 these king david made holy to the lord together with the silver and gold he had taken from all nations from edom and moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek
 and when he came back from putting to the sword eighteen thousand of the edomites in the valley of salt
 david put armed forces in all the towns of edom and all the edomites became servants to david the lord made david overcome wherever he went
 so david was king over all israel judging and giving right decisions for all his people
 and joab the son of zeruiah was chief of the army and jehoshaphat son of ahilud was keeper of the records
 and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were priests and shavsha was the scribe
 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief of those whose places were at the kings side
 now it came about after this that death came to nahash the king of the children of ammon and his son became king in his place
 and david said i will be a friend to hanun the son of nahash because his father was a friend to me so david sent men to him to give him words of comfort on account of his father and the servants of david came to hanun to the land of the children of ammon offering him comfort
 but the chiefs of the children of ammon said to hanun does it seem to you that david is honouring your father by sending comforters to you is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so that they may overcome it
 so hanun took davids servants and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle sent them away
 then certain men went and gave david word of what had been done to them and he sent out with the purpose of meeting them for the men were greatly shamed and the king said keep where you are at jericho till your hair is long again and then come back
 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war carriages and horsemen from mesopotamia and aram maacah and zobah
 so with this money they got thirty two thousand war carriages and the help of the king of maacah and his people who came and took up their position in front of medeba and the children of ammon came together from their towns for the fight
 and david hearing of it sent joab with all the army of fighting men
 so the children of ammon came out and put their forces in position on the way into the town and the kings who had come were stationed by themselves in the field
 now when joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back he took all the best men of israel and put them in line against the aramaeans
 and the rest of the people he put in position against the children of ammon with abishai his brother at their head
 and he said if the aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me then come to my help and if the children of ammon get the better of you i will come to your help
 take heart and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our god and may the lord do what seems good to him
 so joab and the people who were with him went forward into the fight against the aramaeans and they went in flight before him
 and when the children of ammon saw the flight of the aramaeans they themselves went in flight from abishai his brother and came into the town then joab came back to jerusalem
 and when the aramaeans saw that israel had overcome them they sent men to get the aramaeans who were on the other side of the river with shophach the captain of hadadezers army at their head
 and word of this was given to david and he got all israel together and went over jordan and came to helam and put his forces in position against them and when davids forces were in position against the aramaeans the fight was started
 and the aramaeans went in flight before israel and david put to the sword the men of seven thousand aramaean war carriages and forty thousand footmen and put to death shophach the captain of the army
 and when the servants of hadadezer saw that they were overcome by israel they made peace with david and became his servants and the aramaeans would give no more help to the children of ammon

 and the families of scribes who were living at jabez the tirathites the shimeathites the sucathites these are the kenites the offspring of hammath the father of the family of rechab
 now in the spring at the time when kings go out to war joab went out at the head of the armed forces and made waste all the land of the ammonites and put his men in position before rabbah shutting it in but david was still at jerusalem and joab took rabbah and made it waste
 and david took the crown of milcom from off his head its weight was a talent of gold and it had stones of great price in it and it was put on davids head and he took a great store of goods from the town
 and he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood cutting instruments and iron grain crushers and axes and this he did to all the towns of the children of ammon then david and all the people went back to jerusalem
 now after this there was war with the philistines at gezer then sibbecai the hushathite put to death sippai one of the offspring of the rephaim and they were overcome
 and again there was war with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair put to death lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite the stem of whose spear was like a cloth workers rod
 and again there was war at gath where there was a very tall man who had twenty four fingers and toes six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet he was one of the offspring of the rephaim
 and when he put shame on israel jonathan the son of shimea davids brother put him to death
 these were of the offspring of the rephaim in gath they came to their death by the hands of david and his servants
 now satan designing evil against israel put into davids mind the impulse to take the number of israel
 and david said to joab and the captains of the people now let all israel from beer sheba to dan be numbered and give me word so that i may be certain of their number
 and joab said may the lord make his people a hundred times more in number than they are but my lord king are they not all my lords servants why would my lord have this done why will he become a cause of sin to israel
 but the kings word was stronger than joabs so joab went out and went through all israel and came to jerusalem
 and joab gave david the number of all the people all the men of israel able to take up arms were one million one hundred thousand men and those of judah were four hundred and seventy thousand men able to take up arms
 but levi and benjamin were not numbered among them for joab was disgusted with the kings order
 and god was not pleased with this thing so he sent punishment on israel
 then david said to god great has been my sin in doing this but now be pleased to take away the sin of your servant for i have done very foolishly
 then the word of the lord came to gad davids seer saying
 go and say to david the lord says three things are offered to you say which of them you will have so that i may do it to you
 so gad came to david and said to him the lord says take whichever you will
 three years when there will not be enough food or three months of war when you will go in flight before your haters being in great danger of the sword or three days of the sword of the lord disease in the land and the angel of the lord taking destruction through all the land of israel now give thought to the answer i am to take back to him who sent me
 and david said to gad this is a hard decision for me to make let me come into the hands of the lord for great are his mercies let me not come into the hands of men
 so the lord sent disease on israel causing the death of seventy thousand men
 and god sent an angel to jerusalem for its destruction and when he was about to do so the lord saw and had regret for the evil and said to the angel of destruction it is enough do no more now the angel of the lord was by the grain floor of ornan the jebusite
 and david lifting up his eyes saw the angel of the lord there between earth and heaven with an uncovered sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the responsible men clothed in haircloth went down on their faces
 and david said to god was it not i who gave the order for the people to be numbered it is i who have done the sin and the great wrong but these are only sheep what have they done let your hand o lord god be lifted up against me and against my family but not against your people to send disease on them
 then the angel of the lord gave orders to gad to say to david that he was to go and put up an altar to the lord on the grain floor of ornan the jebusite
 and david went up as gad had said in the name of the lord
 and ornan turning back saw the angel and his four sons who were with him went to a secret place now ornan was crushing his grain
 and when david came ornan looking saw him and came out from the grain floor and went down on his face to the earth before him
 then david said to ornan give me the place where this grain floor is so that i may put up an altar here to the lord let me have it for its full price so that this disease may be stopped among the people
 and ornan said to david take it and let my lord the king do what seems right to him see i give you the oxen for burned offerings and the grain cleaning instruments for fire wood and the grain for the meal offering i give it all
 and king david said to ornan no i will certainly give you the full price for it because i will not take for the lord what is yours or give a burned offering without payment
 so david gave ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place
 and david put up an altar there to the lord offering burned offerings and peace offerings with prayers to the lord and he gave him an answer from heaven sending fire on the altar of burned offering
 then the lord gave orders to the angel and he put back his sword into its cover
 at that time when david saw that the lord had given him an answer on the grain floor of ornan the jebusite he made an offering there
 for the house of the lord which moses had made in the waste land and the altar of burned offerings were at that time in the high place at gibeon
 but david was not able to go before it to get directions from the lord so great was his fear of the sword of the angel of the lord
 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar for israels burned offerings
 and david gave orders to get together all the men from strange lands who were in the land of israel and he put stone cutters to work cutting stones for building the house of god
 and he got together a great store of iron for the nails for the doors and for the joins and brass more in weight than might be measured
 and cedar trees without number for the zidonians and the men of tyre came with a great amount of cedar trees for david
 and david said solomon my son is young and untested and the house which is to be put up for the lord is to be very great a thing of wonder and glory through all countries so i will make ready what is needed for it so david got ready a great store of material before his death
 then he sent for his son solomon and gave him orders for the building of a house for the lord the god of israel
 and david said to solomon my son it was my desire to put up a house for the name of the lord my god
 but the word of the lord came to me saying you have taken lives without number and made great wars i will not let you be the builder of a house for my name because of the lives you have taken on the earth before my eyes
 but you will have a son who will be a man of rest and i will give him rest from wars on every side his name will be solomon and in his time i will give israel peace and quiet
 he will be the builder of a house for my name he will be to me a son and i will be to him a father and i will make the seat of his rule over israel certain for ever
 now my son may the lord be with you and may you do well and put up the house of the lord your god as he has said of you
 only may the lord give you wisdom and knowledge of his orders for israel so that you may keep the law of the lord your god
 and all will go well for you if you take care to keep the laws and the rules which the lord gave to moses for israel be strong and take heart have no fear and do not be troubled
 now see poor though i am i have got ready for the house of the lord a hundred thousand talents of gold and a million talents of silver and a weight of brass and iron greater than may be measured and wood and stone have i made ready and you may put more to it
 and you have a great number of workmen cutters and workers of stone and wood and experts in every sort of work
 in gold and silver and brass and iron more than may be numbered up  then and to work and may the lord be with you
 then david gave orders to all the chiefs of israel to give their help to solomon his son saying
 is not the lord your god with you and has he not given you rest on every side for the lord has given the people of the land into my hands and the land is overcome before the lord and before his people
 now give your heart and soul to the worship of the lord your god and get to work on the building of the holy place of the lord god so that you may put the ark of the lords agreement and the holy vessels of god in the house which is to be made for the name of the lord
 now david was old and full of days and he made his son solomon king over israel
 and he got together all the chiefs of israel with the priests and the levites
 and the levites all those of thirty years old and over were numbered and the number of them by heads man by man was thirty eight thousand
 of these twenty four thousand were to be overseers of the work of the house of the lord and six thousand were judges and men of authority
 four thousand were door keepers and four thousand gave praise to the lord with the instruments which i made said david for giving praise
 and david put them into divisions under the names of the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari
 of the gershonites ladan and shimei
 the sons of ladan jehiel the chief and zetham and joel three
 the sons of shimei shelomoth and haziel and haran three these were the heads of the families of ladan
 and the sons of shimei jahath zizah and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei
 jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had only a small number of sons so they were grouped together as one family
 the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four
 the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was made separate and holy he and his sons for ever for the care of the most holy things and the burning of offerings before the lord to do his work and give blessings in his name for ever
 and the sons of moses the man of god were put into the list of the tribe of levi
 the sons of moses gershom and eliezer
 the sons of gershom shebuel the first
 and the sons of eliezer rehabiah the first and eliezer had no other sons but rehabiah had a great number
 the sons of izhar shelomith the first
 the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the second jahaziel the third and jekameam the fourth
 the sons of uzziel micah the first and isshiah the second
 the sons of merari mahli and mushi the sons of mahli eleazar and kish
 and at his death eleazar had no sons but only daughters and their relations the sons of kish took them as wives
 the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three
 these were the sons of levi grouped by families the heads of the families of those who were numbered by name by heads all those of twenty years old and over who did the work of the house of the lord
 for david said the lord the god of israel has given his people rest and he has made his resting place in jerusalem for ever
 and from now there will be no need for the house of the lord and the vessels used in it to be moved about by the levites
 so among the last acts of david was the numbering of the sons of levi from twenty years old and over
 their place was by the side of the sons of aaron in all the work of the house of the lord in the open spaces and in the rooms in the making clean of all the holy things in doing all the work of the house of the lord
 the holy bread was in their care and the crushed grain for the meal offering of unleavened cakes or meal cooked over the fire or in water they had control of all sorts of weights and measures
 they had to take their places every morning to give praise and make melody to the lord and in the same way at evening
 at every offering of burned offerings to the lord on sabbaths and at the new moons and on the regular feasts in the number ordered by the law at all times before the lord
 and they had the care of the tent of meeting and the holy place under the direction of the sons of aaron their brothers for the work of the house of the lord
 now the divisions into which the sons of aaron were grouped were these the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
 but nadab and abihu came to their end before their father and had no children so eleazar and ithamar did the work of priests
 and david with zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar made distribution of them into their positions for their work
 and there were more chiefs among the sons of eleazar than among the sons of ithamar and this is how they were grouped of the sons of eleazar there were sixteen all heads of families and of the sons of ithamar heads of families there were eight
 so they were put into groups by the lords decision one with another for there were rulers of the holy place and rulers of the house of god among the sons of eleazar and the sons of ithamar
 and shemaiah the son of nethanel the scribe who was a levite put down their names in writing the king being present with the rulers and zadok the priest and ahimelech the son of abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and the levites one family being taken for eleazar and then one for ithamar and so on
 now the first name to come out was that of jehoiarib the second jedaiah
 the third harim the fourth seorim
 the fifth malchijah the sixth mijamin
 the seventh hakkoz the eighth abijah
 the ninth jeshua the tenth shecaniah
 the eleventh eliashib the twelfth jakim
 the thirteenth huppah the fourteenth jeshebeab
 the fifteenth bilgah the sixteenth immer
 the seventeenth hezir the eighteenth happizzez
 the nineteenth pethahiah the twentieth jehezkel
 the twenty first jachin the twenty second gamul
 the twenty third delaiah the twenty fourth maaziah
 so they were put into their different groups to take their places in the house of the lord in agreement with the rules made by aaron their father as the lord the god of israel had given him orders
 and of the rest of the sons of levi of the sons of amram shubael of the sons of shubael jehdeiah
 of rehabiah of the sons of rehabiah isshiah the chief
 of the izharites shelomoth of the sons of shelomoth jahath
 and the sons of hebron jeriah the chief amariah the second jahaziel the third jekameam the fourth
 the sons of uzziel micah of the sons of micah shamir
 the brother of micah isshiah of the sons of isshiah zechariah
 the sons of merari mahli and mushi the sons of jaaziah
 the sons of merari of jaaziah shoham and zaccur and ibri
 of mahli eleazar who had no sons
 of kish the sons of kish jerahmeel

 but god said to me you are not to be the builder of a house for my name because you are a man of war and have taken life
 though the lord the god of israel took me out of all my fathers family to be king over israel for ever marking out judah to be chief and of the people of judah my fathers family and among the sons of my father he was pleased to make me king over all israel
 and of all my sons  for the lord has given me a great number of sons  he has made selection of solomon to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of the lord over israel

 and you solomon my son get knowledge of the god of your father and be his servant with a true heart and with a strong desire for the lord is the searcher of all hearts and has knowledge of all the designs of mens thoughts if you make search for him he will be near you but if you are turned away from him he will give you up for ever
 now then take note for the lord has made selection of you to be the builder of a house for the holy place be strong and do it
 then david gave to his son solomon the design of the doorway of the house of god and of its houses and its store houses and the higher rooms and the inner rooms and the place for the mercy seat
 and the design of all he had in his heart for the outer squares of the house of the lord and for the rooms all round it and for the store houses of the house of the lord and for the store houses for the holy things

 and see there are the divisions of the priests and levites for all the work of the house of god and every trained and expert workman will be ready to do for you whatever is needed and the captains and the people will be under your orders in everything

 and they gave for the use of the house of the lord five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold and ten thousand talents of silver and eighteen thousand talents of brass and a hundred thousand talents of iron
 and those who had stones of great price gave them to the store of the house of the lord under the care of jehiel the gershonite
 then the people were glad because their offerings were freely given for with a true heart they freely gave what they had to the lord and david the king was full of joy
 so david gave praise to the lord before all the people and david said praise be to you o lord the god of israel our father for ever and ever
 yours o lord is the strength and the power and the glory and the authority and the honour for everything in heaven and on earth is yours yours is the kingdom o lord and you are lifted up as head over all
 wealth and honour come from you and you are ruler over all and in your hand is power and strength it is in your power to make great and to give strength to all
 so now our god we give you praise honouring the glory of your name
 but who am i and what is my people that we have power to give so freely in this way for all things come from you and what we have given you is yours
 for we as all our fathers were are like men from a strange country before you who have got a place for a time in the land our days on the earth are like a shade and there is no hope of going on
 o lord our god all this store which we have made ready for the building of a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is yours
 and i am conscious my god that you are the searcher of hearts taking pleasure in righteousness as for me with an upright heart i have freely given all these things and i have seen with joy your people who are here to make their offerings freely to you
 o lord the god of abraham of isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever in the deepest thoughts of your people and let their hearts be fixed and true to you
 and give to solomon my son a true heart to keep your orders your rules and your laws and to do all these things and to put up this great house for which i have made ready
 and david said to all the people now give praise to the lord your god and all the people gave praise to the lord the god of their fathers with bent heads worshipping the lord and the king
 and they made offerings to the lord and gave burned offerings to the lord on the day after a thousand oxen a thousand sheep and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and a great wealth of offerings for all israel
 and with great joy they made a feast before the lord that day and they made solomon the son of david king a second time putting the holy oil on him to make him holy to the lord as ruler and on zadok as priest

 now king david was old and far on in years and though they put covers over him his body was cold
 so his servants said to him let search be made for a young virgin for my lord the king to take care of him and be waiting on him and you may take her in your arms and so my lord the king will be warm
 so after searching through all the land of israel for a fair young girl they saw abishag the shunammite and took her to the king
 now she was very beautiful and she took care of the king waiting on him at all times but the king had no connection with her
 then adonijah the son of haggith lifting himself up in pride said i will become king and he made ready his carriages of war and his horsemen with fifty runners to go before him
 now all his life his father had never gone against him or said to him why have you done so and he was a very good looking man and younger than absalom
 and he had talk with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they were on his side and gave him their support
 but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and davids men of war did not take the side of adonijah
 then adonijah put to death sheep and oxen and fat beasts by the stone of zoheleth by en rogel and he sent for all his brothers the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants to come to him
 but he did not send for nathan the prophet and benaiah and the other men of war and solomon his brother
 then nathan said to bath sheba the mother of solomon has it not come to your ears that adonijah the son of haggith has made himself king without the knowledge of david our lord
 so now let me make a suggestion so that you may keep your life safe and the life of your son solomon
 come now go to king david and say to him did you not o my lord take an oath to me your servant saying truly solomon your son will be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom why then is adonijah acting as king
 and while you are still talking there with the king see i will come in after you and say that your story is true
 then bath sheba went into the kings room now the king was very old and abishag the shunammite was waiting on him
 and bath sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour and he said what is your desire
 and she said to him my lord you took an oath by the lord your god and gave your word to your servant saying truly solomon your son will be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom
 and now see adonijah has made himself king without my lords knowledge
 and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers and has sent for all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the army but he has not sent for solomon your servant
 and now my lord the king the eyes of all israel are on you waiting for you to say who is to take the place of my lord the king after him
 for as things are it will come about when my lord the king is sleeping with his fathers that i and solomon my son will be made outlaws
 and while she was still talking with the king nathan the prophet came in
 and they said to the king here is nathan the prophet and when he came in before the king he went down on his face on the earth
 and nathan said o my lord king have you said adonijah is to be king after me seated on the seat of my kingdom
 because today he has gone down and has put to death oxen and fat beasts and sheep in great numbers and has sent for all the kings sons to come to him with the captains of the army and abiathar the priest and they are feasting before him and crying long life to king adonijah 
 but me your servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and your servant solomon he has not sent for
 has this thing been done by my lord the king without giving word to your servants who was to be placed on my lord the kings seat after him
 then king david in answer said send for bath sheba to come to me and she came in and took her place before the king
 and the king took an oath and said by the living lord who has been my saviour from all my troubles
 as i took an oath to you by the lord the god of israel saying certainly solomon your son will become king after me seated on my seat in my place so will i do this day
 then bath sheba went down on her face on the earth before the king giving him honour and said may my lord king david go on living for ever
 and king david said send for zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king
 and the king said to them take with you the servants of your lord and put solomon my son on my beast yes mine and take him down to gihon
 and there let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him to make him king over israel and sounding the horn say long life to king solomon 
 then come up after him and he will come in and take his place on the seat of my kingdom for he is to be king in my place and i have given orders that he is to be ruler over israel and over judah
 and benaiah the son of jehoiada answering the king said so be it and may the lord the god of my lord the king say so
 as the lord has been with my lord the king even so may he be with solomon and make the seat of his authority greater than that of my lord king david
 so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and put solomon on king davids beast and took him to gihon
 and zadok the priest took the vessel of oil out of the tent and put the holy oil on solomon and when the horn was sounded all the people said long life to king solomon 
 and all the people came up after him piping with pipes and they were glad with great joy so that the earth was shaking with the sound
 and it came to the ears of adonijah and all the guests who were with him when their meal was ended and joab hearing the sound of the horn said what is the reason of this noise as if the town was worked up
 and while the words were on his lips jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said come in for you are a man of good faith and the news which you have for us will be good
 and jonathan answering said to adonijah not so but our lord king david has made solomon king
 and he sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they put him on the kings beast
 and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet put the holy oil on him and made him king in gihon and they came back from there with joy and the town was all worked up this is the noise which has come to your ears
 and now solomon is seated on the seat of the kingdom
 and the kings servants came to our lord king david blessing him and saying may god make the name of solomon better than your name and the seat of his authority greater than your seat and the king was bent low in worship on his bed
 then the king said may the god of israel be praised who has given one of my seed to be king in my place this day and has let my eyes see it
 and all the guests of adonijah got up in fear and went away every man to his place
 and adonijah himself was full of fear because of solomon and he got up and went to the altar and put his hands on its horns
 and they gave solomon word of it saying see adonijah goes in such fear of king solomon that he has put his hands on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon first give me his oath that he will not put his servant to death with the sword
 and solomon said if he is seen to be a man of good faith not a hair of him will be touched but if any wrongdoing is seen in him he is to be put to death
 so king solomon sent and they took him down from the altar and he came and gave honour to king solomon and solomon said to him go to your house
 now the queen of sheba hearing great things of solomon came to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions
 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels weighted down with spices and stores of gold and jewels and when she came to solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind
 and solomon gave her answers to all her questions there was no secret which the king did not make clear to her
 and when the queen of sheba had seen all the wisdom of solomon and the house which he had made
 and the food at his table and all his servants seated there and those who were waiting on him in their places and their robes and his wine servants and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
 and she said to the king the account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true
 but i had no faith in what was said about you till i came and saw for myself and now i see that it was not half the story your wisdom and your wealth are much greater than they said
 happy are your wives happy are these your servants whose place is ever before you hearing your words of wisdom
 may the lord your god be praised whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of the kingdom of israel because the lords love for israel is eternal he has made you king to be their judge in righteousness
 and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a great store of spices and jewels never again was such a wealth of spices seen as that which the queen of sheba gave king solomon
 and the sea force of hiram in addition to gold from ophir came back with much sandal wood and jewels
 and from the sandal wood the king made pillars for the house of the lord and for the kings house and instruments of music for the makers of melody never has such sandal wood been seen to this day
 and king solomon gave the queen of sheba all her desire whatever she made request for in addition to what he gave her freely from the impulse of his heart so she went back to her country she and her servants
 now the weight of gold which came to solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents
 in addition to what came to him from the business of the traders and from all the kings of the arabians and from the rulers of the country
 and solomon made two hundred body covers of hammered gold every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it
 and he made three hundred smaller body covers of hammered gold with three pounds of gold in every cover and the king put them in the house of the woods of lebanon
 then the king made a great ivory seat plated with the best gold
 there were six steps going up to it and the top of it was round at the back there were arms on the two sides of the seat and two lions by the side of the arms
 and twelve lions were placed on the one side and on the other side on the six steps there was nothing like it in any kingdom
 and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the woods of lebanon were of the best gold not one was of silver for no one gave a thought to silver in the days of king solomon
 for the king had tarshish ships at sea with the ships of hiram once every three years the tarshish ships came with gold and silver and ivory and monkeys and peacocks
 and king solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom
 and from all over the earth they came to see solomon and to give ear to his wisdom which god had put in his heart
 and everyone took with him an offering vessels of silver and vessels of gold and robes and coats of metal and spices and horses and beasts of transport regularly year by year
 and solomon got together war carriages and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept some in the carriage towns and some with the king at jerusalem
 and the king made silver as common as stones in jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore trees of the lowlands in number
 and solomons horses came from egypt and from kue the kings traders got them at a price from kue
 a war carriage might be got from egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the hittites and the kings of aram
 now a number of strange women were loved by solomon women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites
 the nations of which the lord had said to the children of israel you are not to take wives from them and they are not to take wives from you or they will certainly make you go after their gods to these solomon was united in love
 he had seven hundred wives daughters of kings and three hundred other wives and through his wives his heart was turned away
 for it came about that when solomon was old his heart was turned away to other gods by his wives and his heart was no longer true to the lord his god as the heart of his father david had been
 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and milcom the disgusting god of the ammonites
 and solomon did evil in the eyes of the lord not walking in the lords ways with all his heart as david his father did
 then solomon put up a high place for chemosh the disgusting god of moab in the mountain before jerusalem and for molech the disgusting god worshipped by the children of ammon
 and so he did for all his strange wives who made offerings with burning of perfumes to their gods
 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned away from the lord the god of israel who had twice come to him in a vision
 and had given him orders about this very thing that he was not to go after other gods but he did not keep the orders of the lord
 so the lord said to solomon because you have done this and have not kept my agreement and my laws which i gave you i will take the kingdom away from you by force and will give it to your servant
 i will not do it in your life time because of your father david but i will take it from your son
 still i will not take all the kingdom from him but i will give one tribe to your son because of my servant david and because of jerusalem the town of my selection
 so the lord sent hadad the edomite to make trouble for solomon he was of the kings seed in edom
 and when david had sent destruction on edom and joab the captain of the army had gone to put the dead into the earth and had put to death every male in edom
  for joab and all israel were there six months till every male in edom had been cut off 
 hadad being still a young boy went in flight to egypt with certain edomites servants of his father
 and they went on from midian and came to paran and taking men from paran with them they came to egypt to pharaoh king of egypt who gave him a house and gave orders for his food and gave him land
 now hadad was very pleasing to pharaoh so that he gave him the sister of his wife tahpenes the queen for his wife
 and the sister of tahpenes had a son by him genubath whom tahpenes took care of in pharaohs house and genubath was living in pharaohs house among pharaohs sons
 now when hadad had news in egypt that david had been put to rest with his fathers and that joab the captain of the army was dead he said to pharaoh send me back to my country
 but pharaoh said to him what have you been short of while you have been with me that you are desiring to go back to your country and he said nothing but even so send me back
 and god sent another trouble maker rezon the son of eliada who had gone in flight from his lord hadadezer king of zobah
 he got some men together and made himself captain of a band of outlaws and went to damascus and became king there
 he was a trouble to israel all through the days of solomon and this is the damage hadad did he was cruel to israel while he was ruler over edom
 and there was jeroboam the son of nebat an ephraimite from zeredah a servant of solomon whose mother was zeruah a widow and his hand was lifted up against the king
 the way in which his hand came to be lifted up against the king was this solomon was building the millo and making good the damaged parts of the town of his father david
 and jeroboam was an able and responsible man and solomon saw that he was a good worker and made him overseer of all the work given to the sons of joseph
 now at that time when jeroboam was going out of jerusalem the prophet ahijah the shilonite came across him on the road now ahijah had put on a new robe and the two of them were by themselves in the open country
 and ahijah took his new robe in his hands parting it violently into twelve
 and he said to jeroboam take ten of the parts for this is what the lord has said see i will take the kingdom away from solomon by force and will give ten tribes to you
  but one tribe will be his because of my servant david and because of jerusalem the town which out of all the tribes of israel i have made mine 
 because they are turned away from me to the worship of ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and chemosh the god of moab and milcom the god of the ammonites they have not been walking in my ways or doing what is right in my eyes or keeping my laws and my decisions as his father david did
 but i will not take the kingdom from him i will let him be king all the days of his life because of david my servant in whom i took delight because he kept my orders and my laws
 but i will take the kingdom from his son and give it to you
 and one tribe i will give to his son so that david my servant may have a light for ever burning before me in jerusalem the town which i have made mine to put my name there
 and you i will take and you will be king over israel ruling over whatever is the desire of your soul
 and if you give attention to the orders i give you walking in my ways and doing what is right in my eyes and keeping my laws and my orders as david my servant did then i will be with you building up for you a safe house as i did for david and i will give israel to you
  so that i may send trouble for this on the seed of david but not for ever 
 and solomon was looking for a chance to put jeroboam to death but he went in flight to egypt to shishak king of egypt and was in egypt till the death of solomon
 now the rest of the acts of solomon and all he did and his wisdom are they not recorded in the book of the acts of solomon
 and the time solomon was king in jerusalem over all israel was forty years
 and solomon went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and solomon went to rest with his fathers and rehoboam his son became king in his place
 and rehoboam went to shechem where all israel had come together to make him king
 and hearing of it jeroboam the son of nebat who was still in egypt where he had gone in flight from solomon and was living there came back to his town zeredah in the hill country of ephraim
 and all the men of israel came to rehoboam and said
 your father put a hard yoke on us if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard then we will be your servants
 and he said to them go away for three days and then come back to me again so the people went away
 then king rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with solomon his father when he was living and said in your opinion what answer am i to give to this people
 and they said to him if you will be a servant to this people today caring for them and giving them a gentle answer then they will be your servants for ever
 but he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men and went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him
 and said to them what is your opinion what answer are we to give to this people who have said to me make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us
 and the young men of his generation said to him this is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying your father put a hard yoke on us will you make it less say to them my little finger is thicker than my fathers body
 if my father put a hard yoke on you i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give you blows with snakes
 so all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king had given orders saying come back to me the third day
 and the king gave them a rough answer giving no attention to the suggestion of the old men
 but giving them the answer put forward by the young men saying my father made your yoke hard but i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give it with snakes
 so the king did not give ear to the people and this came about by the purpose of the lord so that what he had said by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam son of nebat might be effected
 and when all israel saw that the king would give no attention to them the people in answer said to the king what part have we in david what is our heritage in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to your people david so israel went away to their tents
  but rehoboam was still king over those of the children of israel who were living in the towns of judah 
 then king rehoboam sent adoniram the overseer of the forced work and he was stoned to death by all israel and king rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to jerusalem
 so israel was turned away from the family of david to this day
 now when all israel had news that jeroboam had come back they sent for him to come before the meeting of the people and made him king over israel not one of them was joined to the family of david but only the tribe of judah
 when rehoboam came to jerusalem he got together all the men of judah and the tribe of benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fighting men to make war against israel and get the kingdom back for rehoboam the son of solomon
 but the word of god came to shemaiah the man of god saying
 say to rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all the men of judah and benjamin and the rest of the people
 the lord has said you are not to go to war against your brothers the children of israel go back every man to his house because this thing is my purpose so they gave ear to the word of the lord and went back as the lord had said
 then jeroboam made the town of shechem in the hill country of ephraim a strong place and was living there and from there he went out and did the same to penuel
 and jeroboam said in his heart now the kingdom will go back to the family of david
 if the people go up to make offerings in the house of the lord at jerusalem their heart will be turned again to their lord to rehoboam king of judah and they will put me to death and go back to rehoboam king of judah
 so after taking thought the king made two oxen of gold and he said to the people you have been going up to jerusalem long enough see  these are your gods o israel who took you out of the land of egypt
 and he put one in beth el and the other in dan
 and this became a sin in israel for the people went to give worship to the one at beth el and to the other at dan
 and he made places for worship at the high places and made priests who were not levites from among all the people
 and jeroboam gave orders for a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like the feast which is kept in judah and he went up to the altar and in the same way in beth el he gave offerings to the oxen which he had made placing in beth el the priests of the high places he had made
 he went up to the altar he had made in beth el on the fifteenth day of the eighth month the month fixed by him at his pleasure and he gave orders for a feast for the people of israel and went up to the altar and there he made the smoke of his offerings go up
 then a man of god came from judah by the order of the lord to beth el where jeroboam was by the altar burning offerings
 and by the order of the lord he made an outcry against the altar saying o altar altar the lord has said from the seed of david will come a child named josiah and on you he will put to death the priests of the high places who are burning offerings on you and mens bones will be burned on you
 the same day he gave them a sign saying this is the sign which the lord has given see the altar will be broken and the burned waste on it overturned
 then the king hearing the man of god crying out against the altar at beth el put out his hand from the altar saying take him prisoner and his hand stretched out against him became dead and he had no power of pulling it back
 and the altar was broken and the burned waste on it overturned this was the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord
 then the king made answer and said to the man of god make a prayer now for the grace of the lord your god and for me that my hand may be made well and in answer to the prayer of the man of god the kings hand was made well again as it was before
 and the king said to the man of god come with me to my house for food and rest and i will give you a reward
 but the man of god said to the king even if you gave me half of all you have i would not go in with you and i would not take food or a drink of water in this place
 for so i was ordered by the word of the lord who said you are not to take food or a drink of water and you are not to go back the way you came
 so he went another way and not by the way he came to beth el
 now there was an old prophet living in beth el and one of his sons came and gave him word of all the man of god had done that day in beth el and they gave their father an account of the words he had said to the king
 then their father said to them which way did he go now his sons had seen which way the man of god who came from judah had gone
 so the prophet said to his sons make ready an ass for me so they made an ass ready and he got on it
 and went after the man of god and came up with him while he was seated under an oak tree and he said to him are you the man of god who came from judah and he said i am
 then he said to him come back to the house with me and have a meal
 but he said i may not go back with you or go into your house and i will not take food or a drink of water with you in this place
 for the lord said to me you are not to take food or water there or go back again by the way you came
 then he said to him i am a prophet like you and an angel said to me by the word of the lord take him back with you and give him food and water but he said false words to him
 so he went back with him and had a meal in his house and a drink of water
 but while they were seated at the table the word of the lord came to the prophet who had taken him back
 and crying out to the man of god who came from judah he said the lord says because you have gone against the voice of the lord and have not done as you were ordered by the lord
 but have come back and have taken food and water in this place where he said you were to take no food or water your dead body will not be put to rest with your fathers
 now after the meal he made ready the ass for him for the prophet whom he had taken back
 and he went on his way but on the road a lion came rushing at him and put him to death and his dead body was stretched in the road with the ass by its side and the lion was there by the body
 and some men going by saw the body stretched out in the road with the lion by its side and they came and gave news of it in the town where the old prophet was living
 then the prophet who had made him come back hearing it said it is the man of god who went against the word of the lord that is why the lord has given him to the lion to be wounded to death as the lord said
 and he said to his sons make ready the ass for me and they did so
 and he went and saw the dead body stretched out in the road with the ass and the lion by its side the lion had not taken the body for its food or done any damage to the ass
 then the prophet took up the body of the man of god and put it on the ass and took it back and he came to the town to put the body to rest with weeping
 and he put the body in the resting place made ready for himself weeping and sorrowing over it saying o my brother 
 and when he had put it to rest he said to his sons when i am dead then you are to put my body into the earth with the body of this man of god and put me by his bones so that my bones may be kept safe with his bones
 for the outcry he made by the word of the lord against the altar in beth el and against all the houses of the high places in the towns of samaria will certainly come about
 after this jeroboam not turning back from his evil ways still made priests for his altars from among all the people he made a priest of anyone desiring it so that there might be priests of the high places
 and this became a sin in the family of jeroboam causing it to be cut off and sent to destruction from the face of the earth
 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam became ill
 and jeroboam said to his wife now come put on different clothing so that you may not seem to be the wife of jeroboam and go to shiloh see ahijah is there the prophet who said i would be king over this people
 and take with you ten cakes of bread and dry cakes and a pot of honey and go to him he will give you word of what is to become of the child
 so jeroboams wife did so and got up and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah now ahijah was unable to see because he was very old
 and the lord had said to ahijah the wife of jeroboam is coming to get news from you about her son who is ill give her such and such an answer for she will make herself seem to be another woman
 then ahijah hearing the sound of her footsteps coming in at the door said come in o wife of jeroboam why do you make yourself seem like another for i am sent to you with bitter news
 go say to jeroboam these are the words of the lord the god of israel though i took you from among the people lifting you up to be a ruler over my people israel
 and took the kingdom away by force from the seed of david and gave it to you you have not been like my servant david who kept my orders and was true to me with all his heart doing only what was right in my eyes
 but you have done evil more than any before you and have made for yourself other gods and images of metal moving me to wrath and turning your back on me
 so i will send evil on the line of jeroboam cutting off from his family every male child those who are shut up and those who go free in israel the family of jeroboam will be brushed away like a man brushing away waste till it is all gone
 those of the family of jeroboam who come to death in the town will become food for the dogs and those on whom death comes in the open country will be food for the birds of the air for the lord has said it
 up then  go back to your house and in the hour when your feet go into the town the death of the child will take place
 and all israel will put his body to rest weeping over him because he only of the family of jeroboam will be put into his resting place in the earth for of all the family of jeroboam in him only has the lord the god of israel seen some good
 and the lord will put up a king over israel who will send destruction on the family of jeroboam in that day
 and even now the hand of the lord has come down on israel shaking it like a river grass in the water and uprooting israel from this good land which he gave to their fathers he will send them this way and that on the other side of the river because they have made for themselves images moving the lord to wrath
 and he will give israel up because of the sins which jeroboam has done and made israel do
 then jeroboams wife got up and went away and came to tirzah and when she came to the doorway of the house death came to the child
 and all israel put his body to rest weeping over him as the lord had said by his servant ahijah the prophet
 now the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he made war and how he became king are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jeroboam was king for twenty two years and was put to rest with his fathers and nadab his son became king in his place
 and rehoboam the son of solomon was king in judah rehoboam was forty one years old when he became king and he was king for seventeen years in jerusalem the town which the lord had made his out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there his mothers name was naamah an ammonite woman
 and judah did evil in the eyes of the lord and made him more angry than their fathers had done by their sins
 for they made high places and upright stones and wood pillars on every high hill and under every green tree
 and more than this there were those in the land who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods doing the same disgusting crimes as the nations which the lord had sent out before the children of israel
 now in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem
 and took away all the stored wealth from the house of the lord and from the kings house and all the gold body covers which solomon had made
 so in their place king rehoboam had other body covers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the kings house
 and whenever the king went into the house of the lord the armed men went with him taking the body covers and then took them back to their room
 now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days
 and rehoboam went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of david his mothers name was naamah an ammonite woman and abijam his son became king in his place
 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat abijam became king over judah
 for three years he was king in jerusalem and his mothers name was maacah the daughter of abishalom
 and he did the same sins which his father had done before him his heart was not completely true to the lord his god like the heart of david his father
 but because of david the lord gave him a light in jerusalem making his sons king after him so that jerusalem might be safe
 because david did what was right in the eyes of the lord and never in all his life went against his orders but only in the question of uriah the hittite
 
 now the rest of the acts of abijam and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam
 then abijam went to rest with his fathers and they put him into the earth in the town of david and asa his son became king in his place
 in the twentieth year that jeroboam was king of israel asa became king over judah
 and he was king for forty one years in jerusalem his mothers name was maacah the daughter of abishalom
 asa did what was right in the eyes of the lord as david his father did
 those used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods he sent out of the country and he took away all the images which his fathers had made
 and he would not let maacah his mother be queen because she had made a disgusting image for asherah and asa had the image cut down and burned by the stream kidron
 the high places however were not taken away but still the heart of asa was true to the lord all his life
 he took into the house of the lord all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy silver and gold and vessels
 now there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
 and baasha king of israel went up against judah building ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to asa king of judah
 then asa took all the silver and gold which was still stored in the lords house and in the kings house and sent them in the care of his servants to ben hadad son of tabrimmon son of rezon king of aram at damascus saying
 let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father see i have sent you an offering of silver and gold go and put an end to your agreement with baasha king of israel so that he may give up attacking me
 so ben hadad did as king asa said and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of israel attacking ijon and dan and abel beth maacah and all chinneroth as far as all the land of naphtali
 and baasha hearing of it put a stop to the building of ramah and was living in tirzah
 then king asa got all judah together making every man come and they took away the stones and the wood with which baasha was building ramah and king asa made use of them for building geba in the land of benjamin and mizpah
 now the rest of the acts of asa and his power and all he did and the towns of which he was the builder are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah but when he was old he had a disease of the feet
 so asa went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and jehoshaphat his son became king in his place
 nadab the son of jeroboam became king over israel in the second year that asa was king of judah and he was king of israel for two years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the evil ways of his father and the sin which he did and made israel do
 and baasha the son of ahijah of the family of issachar made a secret design against him attacking him at gibbethon a town of the philistines for nadab and the armies of israel were making war on gibbethon
 in the third year of the rule of asa king of judah baasha put him to death and became king in his place
 and straight away when he became king he sent destruction on all the offspring of jeroboam there was not one living person of all the family of jeroboam whom he did not put to death so the word of the lord which he said by his servant ahijah the shilonite came about
 because of the sins which jeroboam did and made israel do moving the lord the god of israel to wrath
 now the rest of the acts of nadab and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days
 in the third year of the rule of asa king of judah baasha the son of ahijah became king over all israel in tirzah and was king for twenty four years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the evil ways of jeroboam and the sin which he made israel do
 and the word of the lord came to jehu son of hanani protesting against baasha and saying
 because i took you up out of the dust and made you ruler over my people israel and you have gone in the ways of jeroboam and made my people israel do evil moving me to wrath by their sins
 truly i will see that baasha and all his family are completely brushed away i will make your family like the family of jeroboam the son of nebat
 anyone of the family of baasha who comes to death in the town will become food for the dogs and he to whom death comes in the open country will be food for the birds of the air
 now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and baasha went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth at tirzah and elah his son became king in his place
 and the lord sent his word against baasha and his family by the mouth of the prophet jehu the son of hanani because of all the evil he did in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath by the work of his hands because he was like the family of jeroboam and because he put it to death
 in the twenty sixth year that asa was king of judah elah the son of baasha became king of israel in tirzah and he was king for two years
 and his servant zimri captain of half his war carriages made secret designs against him now he was in tirzah drinking hard in the house of arza controller of the kings house in tirzah
 and zimri went in and made an attack on him and put him to death in the twenty seventh year that asa was king of judah and made himself king in his place
 and straight away when he became king and took his place on the seat of the kingdom he put to death all the family of baasha not one male child of his relations or his friends kept his life
 so zimri put to death all the family of baasha so that the word which the lord said against him by the mouth of jehu the prophet came about
 because of all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son which they did and made israel do moving the lord the god of israel to wrath by their foolish acts
 now the rest of the acts of elah and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 in the twenty seventh year of asa king of judah zimri was king for seven days in tirzah now the people were attacking gibbethon in the land of the philistines
 and news came to the people in the tents that zimri had made a secret design and had put the king to death so all israel made omri the captain of the army king that day in the tents
 then omri went up from gibbethon with all the army of israel and they made an attack on tirzah shutting in the town on every side
 and when zimri saw that the town was taken he went into the inner room of the kings house and burning the house over his head came to his end
 because of his sin in doing evil in the eyes of the lord in going in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he made israel do
 now the rest of the acts of zimri and the secret design he made are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 then there was a division among the people of israel half the people were for making tibni son of ginath king and half were supporting omri
 but the supporters of omri overcame those who were on the side of tibni the son of ginath and death came to tibni and to his brother joram at that time and omri became king in the place of tibni
 in the thirty first year of asa king of judah omri became king over israel and he was king for twelve years for six years he was ruling in tirzah
 he got the hill samaria from shemer for the price of two talents of silver and he made a town there building it on the hill and naming it samaria after shemer the owner of the hill
 and omri did evil in the eyes of the lord even worse than all those before him
 copying all the evil ways of jeroboam the son of nebat and all the sins he did and made israel do moving the lord the god of israel to wrath by their foolish ways
 now the rest of the acts which omri did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 so omri went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria and ahab his son became king in his place
 in the thirty eighth year that asa was king of judah ahab the son of omri became king over israel and ahab was king in samaria for twenty two years
 and ahab the son of omri did evil in the eyes of the lord even worse than all who went before him
 and as if copying the evil ways of jeroboam the son of nebat was a small thing for him he took as his wife jezebel daughter of ethbaal king of zidon and became a servant and worshipper of baal
 and he put up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had made in samaria
 and ahab made an image of asherah and did more than all the kings of israel before him to make the lord the god of israel angry
 in his days hiel made jericho he put its base in position at the price of abiram his oldest son and he put its doors in place at the price of his youngest son segub even as the lord had said by joshua the son of nun
 and elijah the tishbite of tishbe in gilead said to ahab by the living lord the god of israel whose servant i am there will be no dew or rain in these years but only at my word
 then the word of the lord came to him saying
 go from here in the direction of the east and keep yourself in a secret place by the stream cherith east of jordan
 the water of the stream will be your drink and by my orders the ravens will give you food there
 so he went and did as the lord said living by the stream cherith east of jordan
 and the ravens took him bread in the morning and meat in the evening and the water of the stream was his drink
 now after a time the stream became dry because there was no rain in the land
 then the word of the lord came to him saying
 up  go now to zarephath in zidon and make your living place there i have given orders to a widow woman there to see that you have food
 so he got up and went to zarephath and when he came to the door of the town he saw a widow woman getting sticks together and crying out to her he said will you give me a little water in a vessel for my drink
 and when she was going to get it he said to her and get me with it a small bit of bread
 then she said by the life of the lord your god i have nothing but a little meal in my store and a drop of oil in the bottle and now i am getting two sticks together so that i may go in and make it ready for me and my son so that we may have a meal before our death
 and elijah said to her have no fear go and do as you have said but first make me a little cake of it and come and give it to me and then make something for yourself and your son
 for this is the word of the lord the god of israel the store of meal will not come to an end and the bottle will never be without oil till the day when the lord sends rain on the earth
 so she went and did as elijah said and she and he and her family had food for a long time
 the store of meal did not come to an end and the bottle was never without oil as the lord had said by the mouth of elijah
 now after this the son of the woman of the house became ill so ill that there was no breath in him
 and she said to elijah what have i to do with you o man of god have you come to put god in mind of my sin and to put my son to death
 and he said to her give your son to me and lifting him out of her arms he took him up to his room and put him down on his bed
 and crying to the lord he said o lord my god have you sent evil even on the widow whose guest i am by causing her sons death
 and stretching herself out on the child three times he made his prayer to the lord saying o lord my god be pleased to let this childs life come back to him again
 and the lord gave ear to the voice of elijah and the childs spirit came into him again and he came back to life
 and elijah took the child down from his room into the house and gave him to his mother and said to her see your son is living
 then the woman said to elijah now i am certain that you are a man of god and that the word of the lord in your mouth is true
 now after a long time the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go and let ahab see you so that i may send rain on the earth
 so elijah went to let ahab see him now there was no food to be had in samaria
 and ahab sent for obadiah the controller of the kings house  now obadiah had the fear of the lord before him greatly
 for when jezebel was cutting off the prophets of the lord obadiah took a hundred of them and kept them secretly in a hole in the rock fifty at a time and gave them bread and water 
 and ahab said to obadiah come let us go through all the country to all the fountains of water and all the rivers and see if there is any grass to be had for the horses and the transport beasts so that we may be able to keep some of the beasts from destruction
 so they went through all the country covering it between them ahab went in one direction by himself and obadiah went in another by himself
 and while obadiah was on his way he came face to face with elijah and seeing who it was he went down on his face and said is it you my lord elijah
 and elijah in answer said it is i now go and say to your lord elijah is here
 and he said what sin have i done that you would give up your servant into the hand of ahab and be the cause of my death
 by the life of the lord your god there is not a nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent in search of you and when they said he is not here he made them take an oath that they had not seen you
 and now you say go say to your lord elijah is here
 and straight away when i have gone from you the spirit of the lord will take you away i have no idea where so that when i come and give word to ahab and he sees you not he will put me to death though i your servant have been a worshipper of the lord from my earliest years
 has my lord not had word of what i did when jezebel was putting the lords prophets to death how i kept a hundred of them in a secret hole in the rock fifty at a time and gave them bread and water
 and now you say go and say to your lord elijah is here and he will put me to death
 and elijah said by the life of the lord of armies whose servant i am i will certainly let him see me today
 so obadiah went to ahab and gave him the news and ahab went to see elijah
 and when he saw elijah ahab said to him is it you you troubler of israel
 then he said in answer i have not been troubling israel but you and your family because turning away from the orders of the lord you have gone after the baals
 now send and get israel together before me at mount carmel with the four hundred and fifty prophets of baal who get their food at jezebels table
 so ahab sent for all the children of israel and got the prophets together at mount carmel
 and elijah came near to all the people and said how long will you go on balancing between two opinions if the lord is god then give worship to him but if baal give worship to him and the people said not a word in answer
 then elijah said to the people i even i am the only living prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men
 now let them give us two oxen and let them take one for themselves and have it cut up and put it on the wood but put no fire under it i will get the other ox ready and put it on the wood and put no fire under it
 and do you make prayers to your god and i will make a prayer to the lord and it will be clear that the one who gives an answer by fire is god and all the people in answer said it is well said
 then elijah said to the prophets of baal take one ox for yourselves and get it ready first for there are more of you and make your prayers to your god but put no fire under
 so they took the ox which was given them and made it ready crying out to baal from morning till the middle of the day and saying o baal give ear to us but there was no voice and no answer and they were jumping up and down before the altar they had made
 and in the middle of the day elijah made sport of them saying give louder cries for he is a god he may be deep in thought or he may have gone away for some purpose or he may be on a journey or by chance he is sleeping and has to be made awake
 so they gave loud cries cutting themselves with knives and swords as was their way till the blood came streaming out all over them
 and from the middle of the day they went on with their prayers till the time of the offering but there was no voice or any answer or any who gave attention to them
 then elijah said to all the people come near to me and all the people came near and he put up again the altar of the lord which had been broken down
 and elijah took twelve stones the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob to whom the lord had said israel will be your name
 and with the stones he made an altar to the name of the lord and he made a deep drain all round the altar great enough to take two measures of seed
 and he put the wood in order and cutting up the ox put it on the wood then he said get four vessels full of water and put it on the burned offering and on the wood and he said do it a second time and they did it a second time
 and he said do it a third time and they did it a third time
 and the water went all round the altar till the drain was full
 then at the time of the offering elijah the prophet came near and said o lord the god of abraham of isaac and of israel let it be seen this day that you are god in israel and that i am your servant and that i have done all these things by your order
 give me an answer o lord give me an answer so that this people may see that you are god and that you have made their hearts come back again
 then the fire of the lord came down burning up the offering and the wood and the stones and the dust and drinking up the water in the drain
 and when the people saw it they all went down on their faces and said the lord he is god the lord he is god
 and elijah said to them take the prophets of baal let not one of them get away so they took them and elijah made them go down to the stream kishon and put them to death there
 then elijah said to ahab up  take food and drink for there is a sound of much rain
 so ahab went up to have food and drink while elijah went up to the top of carmel and he went down on the earth putting his face between his knees
 and he said to his servant go now and take a look in the direction of the sea and he went up and after looking said there is nothing and he said go again seven times and he went seven times
 and the seventh time he said i see a cloud coming up out of the sea as small as a mans hand then he said go up and say to ahab get your carriage ready and go down or the rain will keep you back
 and after a very little time the heaven became black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab went in his carriage to jezreel
 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he made himself strong and went running before ahab till they came to jezreel
 ahab gave jezebel news of all elijah had done and how he had put all the prophets to death with the sword
 then jezebel sent a servant to elijah saying may the gods punishment be on me if i do not make your life like the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time
 and he got up fearing for his life and went in flight and came to beer sheba in judah parting there from his servant
 while he himself went a days journey into the waste land and took a seat under a broom plant desiring for himself only death for he said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am no better than my fathers
 and stretching himself on the earth he went to sleep under the broom plant but an angel touching him said to him get up and have some food
 and looking up he saw by his head a cake cooked on the stones and a bottle of water so he took food and drink and went to sleep again
 and the angel of the lord came again a second time and touching him said get up and have some food or the journey will be overmuch for your strength
 so he got up and took food and drink and in the strength of that food he went on for forty days and nights to horeb the mountain of god
 and there he went into a hole in the rock for the night then the word of the lord came to him saying what are you doing here elijah
 and he said i have been burning for the honour of the lord the god of armies for the children of israel have not kept your agreement they have made destruction of your altars and have put your prophets to death with the sword till i even i am the only one living and now they are attempting to take away my life
 then he said go out and take your place on the mountain before the lord then the lord went by and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind and rocks were broken before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind there was an earth shock but the lord was not in the earth shock
 and after the earth shock a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire the sound of a soft breath
 and elijah hearing it went out covering his face with his robe and took his place in the opening of the hole and there a voice came to him saying what are you doing here elijah
 and he said i have been burning for the honour of the lord the god of armies for the children of israel have not kept your agreement they have had your altars broken down and have put your prophets to death with the sword till i even i am the only one living and now they are attempting to take away my life
 and the lord said to him go back on your way through the waste land to damascus and when you come there put the holy oil on hazael to make him king over aram
 and on jehu son of nimshi making him king over israel and on elisha the son of shaphat of abel meholah to be prophet in your place
 and it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of hazael jehu will put to death and whoever gets away safe from the sword of jehu elisha will put to death
 but i will keep safe seven thousand in israel all those whose knees have not been bent to baal and whose mouths have given him no kisses
 so he went away from there and came across elisha the son of shaphat ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen he himself walking with the twelfth and elijah went up to him and put his robe on him
 and letting the oxen be where they were he came running after elijah and said only let me give a kiss to my father and mother and then i will come after you but he said to him go back again for what have i done to you
 and he went back and took the oxen and put them to death and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen he gave the people a feast then he got up and went after elijah and became his servant
 now the time of davids death came near and he gave orders to solomon his son saying
 i am going the way of all the earth so be strong and be a man
 and keep the orders of the lord your god walking in his ways keeping his laws and his orders and his rules and his words as they are recorded in the law of moses so that you may do well in all you do and wherever you go
 so that the lord may give effect to what he said of me if your children give attention to their ways living uprightly before me with all their heart and their soul you will never be without a man to be king in israel
 now you have knowledge of what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and to the two captains of the army of israel abner the son of ner and amasa the son of jether whom he put to death taking payment for the blood of war in time of peace and making the band of my clothing and the shoes on my feet red with the blood of one put to death without cause
 so be guided by your wisdom and let not his white head go down to the underworld in peace
 but be good to the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be guests at your table for so they came to me when i went in flight from absalom your brother
 now you have with you shimei the son of gera the benjamite of bahurim who put a bitter curse on me on the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to see me at jordan and i gave him my oath by the lord saying i will not put you to death by the sword
 but do not let him be free from punishment for you are a wise man and it will be clear to you what you have to do with him see that his white head goes down to the underworld in blood
 then david went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of david
 david was king over israel for forty years for seven years he was king in hebron and for thirty three years in jerusalem
 and solomon took his place on the seat of david his father and his kingdom was made safe and strong
 then adonijah the son of haggith came to bath sheba the mother of solomon and she said come you in peace and he said yes in peace
 then he said i have something to say to you and she said say on
 and he said you saw how the kingdom was mine and all israel had the idea that i would be their king but now the kingdom is turned about and has become my brothers for it was given to him by the lord
 now i have one request to make to you and do not say no to me and she said to him say on
 then he said will you go to solomon the king  for he will not say no to you  and put before him my request that he will give me abishag the shunammite for a wife
 and bath sheba said good  i will make your request to the king
 so bath sheba went to king solomon to have talk with him on adonijahs account and the king got up to come to her and went down low to the earth before her then he took his place on the kings seat and had a seat made ready for the kings mother and she took her place at his right hand
 then she said i have one small request to make to you do not say no to me and the king said say on my mother for i will not say no to you
 and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah your brother for a wife
 then king solomon made answer and said to his mother why are you requesting me to give abishag the shunammite to adonijah take the kingdom for him in addition for he is my older brother and abiathar the priest and joab the son of zeruiah are on his side
 then king solomon took an oath by the lord saying may gods punishment be on me if adonijah does not give payment for these words with his life
 now by the living lord who has given me my place on the seat of david my father and made me one of a line of kings as he gave me his word truly adonijah will be put to death this day
 and king solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada and he made an attack on him and put him to death
 and to abiathar the priest the king said go to anathoth to your fields for death would be your right reward but i will not put you to death now because you took up the ark of the lord god before david my father and you were with him in all his troubles
 so solomon let abiathar be priest no longer so that he might make the word of the lord come true which he said about the sons of eli in shiloh
 and news of this came to joab for joab had been one of adonijahs supporters though he had not been on absaloms side then joab went in flight to the tent of the lord and put his hands on the horns of the altar
 and they said to king solomon joab has gone in flight to the tent of the lord and is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go make an attack on him
 and benaiah came to the tent of the lord and said to him the king says come out and he said no but let death come to me here and benaiah went back to the king and gave him word of the answer which joab had given
 and the king said do as he has said and make an attack on him there and put his body into the earth so that you may take away from me and from my family the blood of one put to death by joab without cause
 and the lord will send back his blood on his head because of the attack he made on two men more upright and better than himself putting them to the sword without my fathers knowledge even abner the son of ner captain of the army of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the army of judah
 so their blood will be on the head of joab and on the head of his seed for ever but for david and his seed and his family and the seat of his kingdom there will be peace for ever from the lord
 so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and falling on him put him to death and his body was put to rest in his house in the waste land
 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his place over the army and zadok the priest he put in the place of abiathar
 then the king sent for shimei and said to him make a house for yourself in jerusalem and keep there and go to no other place
 for be certain that on the day when you go out and go over the stream kidron death will overtake you and your blood will be on your head
 and shimei said to the king very well  as my lord the king has said so will your servant do and for a long time shimei went on living in jerusalem
 but after three years two of the servants of shimei went in flight to achish son of maacah king of gath and word was given to shimei that his servants had gone to gath
 then shimei got up and making ready his ass he went to gath to achish in search of his servants and he sent and got them from gath
 and news was given to solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and had come back again
 then the king sent for shimei and said to him did i not make you take an oath by the lord protesting to you and saying be certain that on the day when you go out from here wherever you go death will overtake you and you said to me very well 
 why then have you not kept the oath of the lord and the order which i gave you
 and the king said to shimei you have knowledge of all the evil which you did to david my father and now the lord has sent back your evil on yourself
 but a blessing will be on king solomon and the kingdom of david will keep its place before the lord for ever
 so the king gave orders to benaiah the son of jehoiada and he went out and falling on him put him to death and solomons authority over the kingdom was complete
 now ben hadad king of aram got all his army together and thirty two kings with him and horses and carriages of war he went up and made war on samaria shutting it in
 and he sent representatives into the town to ahab king of israel
 and they said to him ben hadad says your silver and your gold are mine and your wives and children are mine
 and the king of israel sent him an answer saying as you say my lord king i am yours with all i have
 then the representatives came back again and said these are the words of ben hadad i sent to you saying give up to me your silver and your gold your wives and your children
 but i will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time to make a search through your house and the houses of your people and everything which is pleasing in your eyes they will take away in their hands
 then the king of israel sent for all the responsible men of the land and said now will you take note and see the evil purpose of this man he sent for my wives and my children my silver and my gold and i did not keep them back
 and all the responsible men and the people said to him do not give attention to him or do what he says
 so he said to the representatives of ben hadad say to my lord the king all the orders you sent the first time i will do but this thing i may not do and the representatives went back with this answer
 then ben hadad sent to him saying may the gods punishment be on me if there is enough of the dust of samaria for all the people at my feet to take some in their hands
 and the king of israel said in answer say to him the time for loud talk is not when a man is putting on his arms but when he is taking them off
 now when this answer was given to ben hadad he was drinking with the kings in the tents and he said to his men take up your positions so they put themselves in position for attacking the town
 then a prophet came up to ahab king of israel and said the lord says have you seen all this great army see i will give it into your hands today and you will see that i am the lord
 and ahab said by whom and he said the lord says by the servants of the chiefs who are over the divisions of the land then he said by whom is the fighting to be started and he made answer by you
 then he got together the servants of all the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land two hundred and thirty two of them and after them he got together all the people all the children of israel seven thousand
 and in the middle of the day they went out but ben hadad was drinking in the tents with the thirty two kings who were helping him
 and the servants of the chiefs who were over the divisions of the land went forward first and when ben hadad sent out they gave him the news saying men have come out from samaria
 and he said if they have come out for peace take them living and if they have come out for war take them living
 so the servants of the chiefs of the divisions of the land went out of the town with the army coming after them
 and every one of them put his man to death and the aramaeans went in flight with israel after them and ben hadad king of aram got away safely on a horse with his horsemen
 and the king of israel went out and took the horses and the war carriages and made great destruction among the aramaeans
 then the prophet came up to the king of israel and said to him now make yourself strong and take care what you do or a year from now the king of aram will come up against you again
 then the king of arams servants said to him their god is a god of the hills that is why they were stronger than we but if we make an attack on them in the lowlands we will certainly be stronger than they
 this is what you have to do take away the kings from their positions and put captains in their places
 and get together another army like the one which came to destruction horse for horse and carriage for carriage and let us make war on them in the lowlands and certainly we will be stronger than they and he gave ear to what they said and did so
 so a year later ben hadad got the aramaeans together and went up to aphek to make war on israel
 and the children of israel got themselves together and food was made ready and they went against them the tents of the children of israel were like two little flocks of goats before them but all the country was full of the aramaeans
 and a man of god came up and said to the king of israel the lord says because the aramaeans have said the lord is a god of the hills and not of the valleys i will give all this great army into your hands and you will see that i am the lord
 now the two armies kept their positions facing one another for seven days and on the seventh day the fight was started and the children of israel put to the sword a hundred thousand aramaean footmen in one day
 but the rest went in flight to aphek into the town where a wall came down on the twenty seven thousand who were still living and ben hadad went in flight into the town into an inner room
 then his servants said to him it is said that the kings of israel are full of mercy let us then put on haircloth and cords on our heads and go to the king of israel it may be that he will give you your life
 so they put on haircloth and cords on their heads and came to the king of israel and said your servant ben hadad says let me now keep my life and he said is he still living he is my brother
 now the men took it as a sign and quickly took up his words and they said ben hadad is your brother then he said go and get him so ben hadad came out to him and he made him get up into his carriage
 and ben hadad said to him the towns my father took from your father i will give back and you may make streets for yourself in damascus as my father did in samaria and as for me at the price of this agreement you will let me go so he made an agreement with him and let him go
 and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the lord give me a wound but the man would not
 then he said to him because you have not given ear to the voice of the lord straight away when you have gone from me a lion will put you to death and when he had gone straight away a lion came rushing at him and put him to death
 then he came across another man and said give me a wound and the man gave him a blow wounding him
 so the prophet went away and pulling his head band over his eyes to keep his face covered took his place by the road waiting for the king
 and when the king went by crying out to him he said your servant went out into the fight and a man came out to me with another man and said keep this man if by any chance he gets away your life will be the price of his life or you will have to give a talent of silver in payment
 but while your servant was turning this way and that he was gone then the king of israel said to him you are responsible you have given the decision against yourself
 then he quickly took the head band from his eyes and the king of israel saw that he was one of the prophets
 and he said to him these are the words of the lord because you have let go from your hands the man whom i had put to the curse your life will be taken for his life and your people for his people
 then the king of israel went back to his house bitter and angry and came to samaria
 now naboth the jezreelite had a vine garden in jezreel near the house of ahab king of samaria
 and ahab said to naboth give me your vine garden so that i may have it for a garden of sweet plants for it is near my house and let me give you a better vine garden in exchange or if it seems good to you let me give you its value in money
 but naboth said to ahab by the lord far be it from me to give you the heritage of my fathers
 so ahab came into his house bitter and angry because naboth the jezreelite had said to him i will not give you the heritage of my fathers and stretching himself on the bed with his face turned away he would take no food
 but jezebel his wife came to him and said why is your spirit so bitter that you have no desire for food
 and he said to her because i was talking to naboth the jezreelite and i said to him let me have your vine garden for a price or if it is pleasing to you i will give you another vine garden for it and he said i will not give you my vine garden
 then jezebel his wife said are you now the ruler of israel get up take food and let your heart be glad i will give you the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite
 so she sent a letter in ahabs name stamped with his stamp to the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority with naboth
 and in the letter she said let a time of public sorrow be fixed and put naboth at the head of the people
 and get two good for nothing persons to come before him and give witness that he has been cursing god and the king then take him out and have him stoned to death
 so the responsible men and the chiefs who were in authority in his town did as jezebel had said in the letter she sent them
 they gave orders for a day of public sorrow and put naboth at the head of the people
 and the two good for nothing persons came in and took their seats before him and gave witness against naboth in front of the people saying naboth has been cursing god and the king then they took him outside the town and had him stoned to death
 and they sent word to jezebel saying naboth has been stoned and is dead
 then jezebel hearing that naboth had been stoned and was dead said to ahab get up and take as your heritage the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite which he would not give you for money for naboth is no longer living but is dead
 so ahab hearing that naboth was dead went down to the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite to take it as his heritage
 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
 go down to ahab king of israel in samaria see he is in the vine garden of naboth the jezreelite where he has gone to take it as his heritage
 say to him the lord says have you put a man to death and taken his heritage then say to him the lord says in the place where dogs have been drinking the blood of naboth there will your blood become the drink of dogs
 and ahab said to elijah have you come face to face with me o my hater and he said i have come to you because you have given yourself up to do evil in the eyes of the lord
 see i will send evil on you and put an end to you completely cutting off from ahab every male child him who is shut up and him who goes free in israel
 and i will make your family like the family of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the family of baasha the son of ahijah because you have made me angry and have made israel do evil
 and of jezebel the lord said jezebel will become food for dogs in the heritage of jezreel
 any man of the family of ahab who comes to his death in the town will become food for the dogs and he who comes to his death in the open country will be food for the birds of the air
  there was no one like ahab who gave himself up to do evil in the eyes of the lord moved to it by jezebel his wife
 he did a very disgusting thing in going after false gods doing all the things the amorites did whom the lord sent out before the children of israel 
 hearing these words ahab in great grief put haircloth on his flesh and went without food sleeping in haircloth and going about quietly
 then the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
 do you see how ahab has made himself low before me because he has made himself low before me i will not send the evil in his life time but in his sons time i will send the evil on his family
 now for three years there was no war between aram and israel
 and it came about in the third year that jehoshaphat king of judah came down to the king of israel
 and the king of israel said to his servants do you not see that ramoth gilead is ours and we are doing nothing to get it back from the hands of the king of aram
 and he said to jehoshaphat will you go with me to ramoth gilead to make war and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses
 then jehoshaphat said to the king of israel let us now get directions from the lord
 so the king of israel got all the prophets together about four hundred men and said to them am i to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and they said go up for the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 but jehoshaphat said is there no other prophet of the lord here from whom we may get directions
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat there is still one man by whom we may get directions from the lord micaiah son of imlah but i have no love for him for he is a prophet of evil to me and not of good and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
 then the king of israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said go quickly and come back with micaiah the son of imlah
 now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah were seated on their seats of authority dressed in their robes by the doorway into samaria and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them
 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said the lord says pushing back the aramaeans with these you will put an end to them completely
 and all the prophets said the same thing saying go up to ramoth gilead and it will go well for you for the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 now the servant who had gone to get micaiah said to him see now all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king so let your words be like theirs and say good things
 and micaiah said by the living lord whatever the lord says to me i will say
 when he came to the king the king said to him micaiah are we to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and in answer he said go up and it will go well for you and the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 then the king said to him have i not again and again put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the lord
 then he said i saw all israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper and the lord said these have no master let them go back every man to his house in peace
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not say that he would not be a prophet of good but of evil
 and he said give ear now to the word of the lord i saw the lord seated on his seat of power with all the army of heaven in their places round him at his right hand and at his left
 and the lord said how may ahab be tricked into going up to ramoth gilead to his death and one said one thing and one another
 then a spirit came forward and took his place before the lord and said i will get him to do it by a trick
 and the lord said how and he said i will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said your trick will have its effect on him go out and do so
 and now see the lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all these your prophets and the lord has said evil against you
 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and gave micaiah a blow on the side of the face saying where is the spirit of the lord whose word is in you
 and micaiah said truly you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe
 and the king of israel said take micaiah and send him back to amon the ruler of the town and to joash the kings son
 and say it is the kings order that this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till i come again in peace
 and micaiah said if you come back at all in peace the lord has not sent his word by me
 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth gilead
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will make a change in my clothing so that i do not seem to be the king and will go into the fight but do you put on your robes so the king of israel made a change in his dress and went into the fight
 now the king of aram had given orders to the thirty two captains of his war carriages saying make no attack on small or great but only on the king of israel
 so when the captains of the war carriages saw jehoshaphat they said truly this is the king of israel and turning against him they came round him but jehoshaphat gave a cry
 and when the captains of the war carriages saw that he was not the king of israel they went back from going after him
 and a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction and gave the king of israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing so he said to the driver of his war carriage go to one side and take me away out of the army for i am badly wounded
 but the fight became more violent while the day went on and the king was supported in his war carriage facing the aramaeans and the floor of the carriage was covered with the blood from his wound and by evening he was dead
 and about sundown a cry went up from all parts of the army saying let every man go back to his town and his country for the king is dead
 and they came to samaria and put the kings body to rest in samaria
 and the war carriage was washed by the pool of samaria which was the bathing place of the loose women and the dogs were drinking his blood there as the lord had said
 now the rest of the acts of ahab and all he did and his ivory house and all the towns of which he was the builder are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 so ahab was put to rest with his fathers and ahaziah his son became king in his place
 and jehoshaphat the son of asa became king over judah in the fourth year of ahabs rule over israel
 jehoshaphat was thirty five years old when he became king and he was king for twenty five years in jerusalem his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
 he did as asa his father had done not turning away from it but doing what was right in the eyes of the lord but the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
 and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel
 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his great power and how he went to war are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 he put an end to the rest of those who were used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods all those who were still in the land in the time of his father asa
 at that time there was no king in edom
 and the representative of king jehoshaphat made a tarshish ship to go to ophir for gold but it did not go because it was broken at ezion geber
 then ahaziah the son of ahab said to jehoshaphat let my men go with yours in the ships but jehoshaphat would not let them
 then jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of david his father and jehoram his son became king in his place
 ahaziah the son of ahab became king over israel in samaria in the seventeenth year of the rule of jehoshaphat the king of judah and he was king over israel for two years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord going in the ways of his father and his mother and in the ways of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel do evil
 he was a servant and worshipper of baal moving the lord the god of israel to wrath as his father had done
 solomon became the son in law of pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaohs daughter as his wife keeping her in the town of david till the house he was building for himself and the house of the lord and the wall round jerusalem were complete
 but all this time the people were making their offerings in the high places because no house had been put up to the name of the lord till those days
 and solomon in his love for the lord kept the laws of david his father but he made offerings and let them go up in smoke on the high places
 and the king went to gibeon to make an offering there because that was the chief high place it was solomons way to make a thousand burned offerings on that altar
 in gibeon solomon had a vision of the lord in a dream by night and god said to him say what i am to give you
 and solomon said great was your mercy to david my father as his life before you was true and upright and his heart was true to you and you have kept for him this greatest mercy a son to take his place this day
 and now o lord my god you have made your servant king in the place of david my father and i am only a young boy with no knowledge of how to go out or come in
 and your servant has round him the people of your selection a people so great that they may not be numbered and no account of them may be given
 give your servant then a wise heart for judging your people able to see what is good and what evil for who is able to be the judge of this great people
 now these words and solomons request were pleasing to the lord
 and god said to him because your request is for this thing and not for long life for yourself or for wealth or for the destruction of your haters but for wisdom to be a judge of causes
 i have done as you said i have given you a wise and far seeing heart so that there has never been your equal in the past and never will there be any like you in the future
 and with this i have given you what you made no request for wealth and honour so that no king was ever your equal
 and if you go on in my ways keeping my laws and my orders as your father david did i will give you a long life
 and solomon awakening saw that it was a dream then he came to jerusalem where he went before the ark of the agreement of the lord offering burned offerings and peace offerings and he made a feast for all his servants
 then two loose women of the town came and took their places before the king
 and one of them said o my lord i and this woman are living in the same house and i gave birth to a child by her side in the house
 and three days after the birth of my child this woman had a child we were together no other person was with us in the house but we two only
 in the night this woman sleeping on her child was the cause of its death
 and she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was sleeping and she took it in her arms and put her dead child in my arms
 and when i got up to give my child the breast i saw that it was dead but in the morning looking at it with care i saw that it was not my son
 and the other woman said no but the living child is my son and the dead one yours but the first said no the dead child is your son and the living one mine so they kept on talking before the king
 then the king said one says the living child is my son and yours is the dead and the other says not so but your son is the dead one and mine is the living
 then he said get me a sword so they went and put a sword before the king
 and the king said let the living child be cut in two and one half given to one woman and one to the other
 then the mother of the living child came forward for her heart went out to her son and she said o my lord give her the child do not on any account put it to death but the other woman said it will not be mine or yours let it be cut in two
 then the king made answer and said give her the child and do not put it to death she is the mother of it
 and news of this decision which the king had made went through all israel and they had fear of the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to give decisions
 now solomon was king over all israel
 and these were his chief men azariah the son of zadok was the priest
 elihoreph and ahijah the sons of shisha were scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was the recorder
 benaiah the son of jehoiada was head of the army zadok and abiathar were priests
 azariah the son of nathan was over those in authority in the different divisions of the country zabud the son of nathan was priest and the kings friend
 ahishar was controller of the kings house adoniram the son of abda was overseer of the forced work
 and solomon put twelve overseers over all israel to be responsible for the stores needed for the king and those of his house every man was responsible for one month in the year
 and these are their names  the son of hur in the hill country of ephraim
  the son of deker in makaz and shaalbim and beth shemesh and elonbeth hanan
  the son of hesed in arubboth socoh and all the land of hepher were under his control
  the son of abinadab in all naphath dor his wife was taphath the daughter of solomon
 baana the son of ahilud in taanach and megiddo and all beth shean which is by the side of zarethan under jezreel from beth shean to abel meholah as far as the far side of jokmeam
  the son of geber in ramoth gilead he had the towns of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead and the country of argob which is in bashan sixty great towns with walls and locks of brass
 ahinadab the son of iddo in mahanaim
 ahimaaz in naphtali he took basemath the daughter of solomon as his wife
 baana the son of hushai in asher and aloth
 jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar
 shimei the son of ela in benjamin
 geber the son of uri in the land of gilead the country of sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and one overseer had authority over all the overseers who were in the land
 judah and israel were as great in number as the sand by the seaside and they took their food and drink with joy in their hearts
 and solomon was ruler over all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the philistines and as far as the edge of egypt men gave him offerings and were his servants all the days of his life
 and the amount of solomons food for one day was thirty measures of crushed grain and sixty measures of meal
 ten fat oxen and twenty oxen from the fields and a hundred sheep in addition to harts and gazelles and roes and fat fowls
 for he had authority over all the country on this side of the river from tiphsah to gaza over all the kings on this side of the river and he had peace round him on every side
 so judah and israel were living safely every man under his vine and his fig tree from dan as far as beer sheba all the days of solomon
 and solomon had four thousand boxed off spaces for horses for his carriages and twelve thousand horsemen
 and those overseers every man in his month saw that food was produced for solomon and all his guests they took care that nothing was overlooked
 and they took grain and dry grass for the horses and the carriage horses to the right place every man as he was ordered
 and god gave solomon a great store of wisdom and good sense and a mind of wide range as wide as the sand by the seaside
 and solomons wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of egypt
 for he was wiser than all men even than ethan the ezrahite and heman and calcol and darda the sons of mahol and he had a great name among all the nations round about
 he was the maker of three thousand wise sayings and of songs to the number of a thousand and five
 he made sayings about all plants from the cedar in lebanon to the hyssop hanging on the wall and about all beasts and birds and fishes and the small things of the earth
 people came from every nation to give ear to the wisdom of solomon from all the kings of the earth who had word of his wisdom
 now hiram king of tyre hearing that solomon had been made king in place of his father sent his servants to him for hiram had ever been a friend to david
 and solomon sent back word to hiram saying
 you have knowledge that david my father was not able to make a house for the name of the lord his god because of the wars which were round him on every side till the lord put all those who were against him under his feet
 but now the lord my god has given me rest on every side no one is making trouble and no evil is taking place
 and so it is my purpose to make a house for the name of the lord my god as he said to david my father your son whom i will make king in your place will be the builder of a house for my name
 so now will you have cedar trees from lebanon cut down for me and my servants will be with your servants and i will give you payment for your servants at whatever rate you say for it is common knowledge that we have no such wood cutters among us as the men of zidon
 and these words of solomon made hiram glad and he said now may the lord be praised who has given to david a wise son to be king over this great people
 then hiram sent to solomon saying the words you sent have been given to me i will do all your desire in the question of cedar wood and cypress wood
 my men will take them down from lebanon to the sea where i will have them corded together to go by sea to whatever place you say and i will have them cut up there so that you may take them away as for payment it will be enough if you give me food for my people
 so hiram gave solomon all the cedar wood and cypress wood he had need of
 and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of grain as food for his people and twenty measures of clear oil this he did every year
 now the lord had given solomon wisdom as he had said to him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they made an agreement together
 then king solomon got together men for the forced work through all israel thirty thousand men in number
 and sent them to lebanon in bands of ten thousand every month for a month they were working in lebanon and for two months in their country and adoniram was in control of them
 then he had seventy thousand for the work of transport and eighty thousand stone cutters in the mountains
 in addition to the chiefs of the responsible men put by solomon to oversee the work three thousand and three hundred in authority over the workmen
 by the kings orders great stones stones of high price were cut out so that the base of the house might be made of squared stone
 solomons builders and hirams builders did the work of cutting them and put edges on them and got the wood and the stone ready for the building of the house
 in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel came out of the land of egypt in the fourth year that solomon was king of israel in the month ziv which is the second month the building of the lords house was started
 the house which solomon made for the lord was sixty cubits long twenty cubits wide and thirty cubits high
 the covered way before the temple of the house was twenty cubits long as wide as the house and ten cubits wide in front of the house
 and for the house he made windows with network across
 and against the walls all round and against the walls of the temple and of the inmost room he put up wings with side rooms all round
 the lowest line of them being five cubits wide the middle six cubits wide and the third seven cubits for there was a space all round the outside walls of the house so that the boards supporting the rooms did not have to be fixed in the walls of the house
  and the stones used in the building of the house were squared at the place where they were cut out there was no sound of hammer or axe or any iron instrument while they were building the house 
 the door to the lowest side rooms was in the right side of the house and they went up by twisting steps into the middle rooms and from the middle into the third
 so he put up the house and made it complete roofing it with boards of cedar wood
 and he put up the line of side rooms against the walls of the house fifteen cubits high resting against the house on boards of cedar wood
  and the word of the lord came to solomon saying
 about this house which you are building if you will keep my laws and give effect to my decisions and be guided by my rules i will give effect to my word which i gave to david your father
 and i will be ever among the children of israel and will not go away from my people
 so solomon made the building of the house complete 
 the walls of the house were covered inside with cedar wood boards from the floor to the roof of the house they were covered inside with wood and the floor was covered with boards of cypress wood
 and at the back of the house a further space of twenty cubits was shut in with boards of cedar wood for the inmost room
 and the house that is the temple in front of the holy place was forty cubits long
  all the inside of the house was cedar wood ornamented with designs of buds and flowers no stonework was to be seen inside 
 and he made ready an inmost room in the middle of the house in which to put the ark of the agreement of the lord
 and the inmost room was twenty cubits square and twenty cubits high plated over with clear gold and he made an altar of cedar wood plating it with gold
 solomon had all the inside of the house covered with gold and he put chains of gold across in front of the inmost room which itself was covered with gold
 plates of gold were put all through the house till it was covered completely  and the altar in the inmost room was all covered with gold 
 in the inmost room he made two winged beings of olive wood ten cubits high
 with outstretched wings five cubits wide the distance from the edge of one wing to the edge of the other was ten cubits
 the two winged ones were ten cubits high of the same size and form
 the two of them were ten cubits high
 these were placed inside the inner house their outstretched wings touching the walls of the house one touching one wall and one the other while their other wings were touching in the middle
 these winged ones were plated over with gold
 and all the walls of the house inside and out were ornamented with forms of winged ones and palm trees and open flowers
 and the floor of the house was covered with gold inside and out
 for the way into the inmost room he made doors of olive wood the arch and the door supports forming a five sided opening
 on the olive wood doors were cut designs of winged ones and palm trees and open flowers all of them with the doors plated with gold
 then he made pillars of olive wood for the way into the temple the pillars were square
 and two folding doors of cypress wood with two leaves
 these were ornamented with designs of winged ones and palm trees and open flowers plated over with gold
 and the inner space was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedar wood boards
 in the fourth year the base of the house was put in its place in the month ziv
 and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month the building of the house was complete in every detail as it had been designed so he was seven years building it
 solomon was thirteen years building a house for himself till it was complete
 and he made the house of the woods of lebanon which was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high resting on four lines of cedar wood pillars with cedar wood supports on the pillars
 and it was covered with cedar over the forty five supports which were on the pillars fifteen in a line
 there were three lines of window frames window facing window in every line
 and all the doors and windows had square frames with the windows facing one another in three lines
 and he made a covered room of pillars fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide and  with steps before it
 then he made a covered room for his high seat when he gave decisions this was the covered room of judging it was covered with cedar wood from floor to roof
 and the house for his living place the other open square in the covered room was made in the same way and then he made a house like it for pharaohs daughter whom solomon had taken as his wife
 all these buildings were made inside and out from base to crowning stone and outside to the great walled square of highly priced stone cut to different sizes with cutting instruments
 and the base was of great masses of highly priced stone some ten cubits and some eight cubits square
 overhead were highly priced stones cut to measure and cedar wood
 the great outer square all round was walled with three lines of squared stones and a line of cedar wood boards round about the open square inside the house of the lord and the covered room of the kings house
 then king solomon sent and got hiram from tyre
 he was the son of a widow of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass he was full of wisdom and knowledge and an expert worker in brass he came to king solomon and did all his work for him
 he it was who made the two brass pillars the first pillar was eighteen cubits high and a line of twelve cubits went round it and the second was the same
 and he made the two crowns to be put on the tops of the pillars of brass made soft in the fire the crowns were five cubits high
 there were nets of open work for the crowns on the tops of the pillars a net of open work for one and a net of open work for the other
 and he made ornaments of apples and two lines of apples all round over the network covering the crowns of the pillars the two crowns in the same way
 the crowns on the tops of the pillars were ornamented with a design of flowers and were four cubits across
 and there were crowns on the two pillars near the round part by the network and there were two hundred apples in lines round every crown
 he put up the pillars at the doorway of the temple naming the one on the right jachin and that on the left boaz
 the tops of the pillars had a design of flowers and the work of making the pillars was complete
 and he made a great metal water vessel ten cubits across from edge to edge five cubits high and thirty cubits round
 and under the edge of it circling it all round for ten cubits were two lines of flower buds made together with it from liquid metal
 it was supported on twelve oxen with their back parts turned to the middle of it three of them facing to the north three to the west three to the south and three to the east the vessel was resting on top of them
 it was as thick as a mans open hand and was curved like the edge of a cup like the flower of a lily it would take two thousand baths
 and he made ten wheeled bases of brass every one four cubits long four cubits wide and three cubits high
 and the bases were made in this way their sides were square fixed in a framework
 and on the square sides between the frames were lions oxen and winged ones and the same on the frame and over and under the lions and the oxen and the winged ones were steps
 every base had four wheels of brass turning on brass rods and their four angles had angle plates under them the angle plates under the base were of metal and there were ornaments at the side of every one
 the mouth of it inside the angle plate was one cubit across it was round like a pillar a cubit and a half across it had designs cut on it the sides were square not round
 the four wheels were under the frames and the rods on which the wheels were fixed were in the base the wheels were a cubit and a half high
 the wheels were made like carriage wheels the rods on which they were fixed the parts forming their edges their rods and the middle points of them were all formed out of liquid metal
 and there were four angle plates at the four angles of every base forming part of the structure of the base
 and at the top of the base there was a round vessel half a cubit high
 in the spaces of the flat sides and on the frames of them he made designs of winged ones lions and palm trees with ornamented edges all round
 all the ten bases were made in this way after the same design of the same size and form
 and he made ten brass washing vessels everyone taking forty baths and measuring four cubits one vessel was placed on every one of the ten bases
 and he put the bases by the house five on the right side and five on the left and he put the great water vessel on the right side of the house to the east facing south
 and hiram made the pots and spades and the basins so hiram came to the end of all the work he did for king solomon in the house of the lord
 the two pillars and the two cups of the crowns which were on the tops of the two pillars and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars
 and the four hundred apples for the network two lines of apples for every network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars
 and the ten bases with the ten washing vessels on them
 and the great water vessel with the twelve oxen under it
 and the pots and the spades and the basins all the vessels which hiram made for king solomon for the house of the lord were of polished brass
 he made them of liquid metal in the lowland of jordan at the way across the river at adama between succoth and zarethan
 the weight of all these vessels was not measured because there was such a number of them it was not possible to get the weight of the brass
 and solomon had all the vessels made for use in the house of the lord the altar of gold and the gold table on which the holy bread was placed
 and the supports for the lights five on the right side and five on the left before the inmost room of clear gold and the flowers and the lights and all the instruments of gold
 and the cups and the scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire trays all of gold and the pins on which the doors were turned the doors of the inner house the most holy place and the doors of the temple all of gold
 so all the work king solomon had done in the house of the lord was complete then solomon took the holy things which david his father had given the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the store houses of the house of the lord
 then solomon sent for all the responsible men of israel and all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of israel to come to him in jerusalem to take the ark of the lords agreement up out of the town of david which is zion
 and all the men of israel came together to king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim the seventh month
 and all the responsible men of israel came and the priests took up the ark
 they took up the ark of the lord and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the tent all these the priests and the levites took up
 and king solomon and all the men of israel who had come together there were with him before the ark making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered
 and the priests took the ark of the agreement of the lord and put it in its place in the inner room of the house in the most holy place under the wings of the winged ones
 for their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was covering the ark and its rods
 the rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inmost room but they were not seen from outside and there they are to this day
 there was nothing in the ark but the two flat stones which moses put there at horeb where the lord made an agreement with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt
 now when the priests had come out of the holy place the house of the lord was full of the cloud
 so that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud for the house of the lord was full of the glory of the lord
 then solomon said o lord to the sun you have given the heaven for a living place but your living place was not seen by men
 so i have made for you a living place a house in which you may be for ever present
 then turning his face about the king gave a blessing to all the men of israel and they were all on their feet together
 and he said praise be to the lord the god of israel who himself gave his word to david my father and with his strong hand has made his word come true saying
 from the day when i took my people israel out of egypt no town in all the tribes of israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting place of my name but i made selection of david to be king over my people israel
 now it was in the heart of david my father to put up a house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 but the lord said to david my father you did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name
 but you yourself will not be the builder of my house but your son the offspring of your body he it is who will put up a house for my name
 and the lord has made his word come true for i have taken my father davids place on the seat of the kingdom of israel as the lord gave his word and i have made a house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 in it i have made a place for the ark in which is the agreement which the lord made with our fathers when he took them out of the land of egypt
 then solomon took his place before the altar of the lord all the men of israel being present and stretching out his hands to heaven
 said o lord the god of israel there is no god like you in heaven or on the earth keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants while they go in your ways with all their hearts
 and you have kept the word which you gave to your servant david my father with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day
 so now o lord the god of israel let your word to your servant david my father come true when you said you will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of israel before me if only your children give attention to their ways walking before me as you have done
 so now o god of israel it is my prayer that you will make your word come true which you said to your servant david my father
 but is it truly possible that god may be housed on earth see heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting place how much less this house which i have made 
 still let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant o lord god and to his prayer for grace give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant sends up to you this day
 that your eyes may be open to this house night and day to this place of which you have said my name will be there hearing the prayer which your servant may make turning to this place
 give ear to the prayers of your servant and the prayers of your people israel when they make their prayers turning to this place give ear in heaven your living place and hearing have mercy
 if a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house
 then let your ear be open in heaven and be the judge of your servants giving your decision against the wrongdoer so that punishment for his sins may come on his head and by your decision keeping from evil him who has done no wrong
 when your people israel are overcome in war because of their sin against you if they are turned to you again honouring your name making prayers to you and requesting your grace in this house
 then give ear in heaven and let the sin of your people israel have forgiveness and take them back again into the land which you gave to their fathers
 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because of their sin against you if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them
 then give ear in heaven so that the sin of your servants and of your people israel may have forgiveness when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage
 if there is no food in the land or if there is disease or if the fruits of the earth are damaged through heat or water locust or worm if their towns are shut in by their attackers whatever trouble whatever disease there may be
 whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man or by all your people israel whatever his trouble may be whose hands are stretched out to this house
 give ear in heaven your living place acting in mercy and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you the reward of all his ways for you and you only have knowledge of the hearts of all the children of men
 so that they may give you worship all the days of their life in the land which you gave to our fathers
 and as for the man from a strange land who is not of your people israel when he comes from a far country because of the glory of your name
  for they will have news of your great name and your strong hand and your out stretched arm  when he comes to make his prayer turning to this house
 give ear in heaven your living place and give him his desire whatever it may be so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name worshipping you as do your people israel and that they may see that this house which i have put up is truly named by your name
 if your people go out to war against their attackers by whatever way you may send them if they make their prayer to the lord turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which i have made for your name
 give ear in heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace and see right done to them
 if they do wrong against you  for no man is without sin  and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them so that they take them away as prisoners into a strange land far off or near
 and if they take thought in the land where they are prisoners and are turned again to you crying out in prayer to you in that land and saying we are sinners we have done wrong we have done evil
 and with all their heart and soul are turned again to you in the land of those who took them prisoners and make their prayer to you turning their eyes to this land which you gave to their fathers and to the town which you took for yourself and the house which i made for your name
 then give ear to their prayer and to their cry in heaven your living place and see right done to them
 answering with forgiveness the people who have done wrong against you and overlooking the evil which they have done against you let those who made them prisoners be moved with pity for them and have pity on them
 for they are your people and your heritage which you took out of egypt out of the iron fireplace
 let your eyes be open to your servants prayer for grace and to the prayer of your people israel hearing them when their cry comes to you
 for you made them separate from all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage as you said by moses your servant when you took our fathers out of egypt o lord god
 then solomon after making all these prayers and requests for grace to the lord got up from his knees before the altar of the lord where his hands had been stretched out in prayer to heaven
 and getting on his feet he gave a blessing to all the men of israel saying with a loud voice
 praise be to the lord who has given rest to his people israel as he gave them his word to do every word of all his oath which he gave by the hand of moses his servant has come true
 now may the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him never go away from us or give us up
 turning our hearts to himself guiding us to go in all his ways to keep his orders and his laws and his decisions which he gave to our fathers
 and may these my words the words of my prayer to the lord be before the lord our god day and night so that he may see right done to his servant and to his people israel day by day as we have need
 so that all the peoples of the earth may see that the lord is god and there is no other
 then let your hearts be without sin before the lord our god walking in his laws and keeping his orders as at this day
 now the king and all israel with him were making offerings before the lord
 and solomon gave to the lord for peace offerings twenty two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel kept the feast of the opening of the lords house
 the same day the king made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the lord offering there the burned offering and the meal offering and the fat of the peace offerings for there was not room on the brass altar of the lord for the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat of the peace offerings
 so solomon and all israel with him a very great meeting  for the people had come together from the way into hamath to the river of egypt  kept the feast at that time before the lord our god for two weeks even fourteen days
 and on the eighth day he sent the people away and blessing the king they went to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts because of all the good which the lord had done to david his servant and to israel his people
 now when solomon came to the end of building the house of the lord and the kings house and all solomons desires which he had in mind were effected
 the lord came to him again in a vision as he had done at gibeon
 and the lord said to him your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears i have made holy this house which you have made and i have put my name there for ever my eyes and my heart will be there at all times
 as for you if you will go on your way before me as david your father did uprightly and with a true heart doing what i have given you orders to do keeping my laws and my decisions
 then i will make the seat of your rule over israel certain for ever as i gave my word to david your father saying you will never be without a man to be king in israel
 but if you are turned from my ways you or your children and do not keep my orders and my laws which i have put before you but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship
 then i will have israel cut off from the land which i have given them and this house which i have made holy for myself i will put away from before my eyes and israel will be a public example and a word of shame among all peoples
 and this house will become a mass of broken walls and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds and they will say why has the lord done so to this land and to this house
 and their answer will be because they were turned away from the lord their god who took their fathers out of the land of egypt they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants that is why the lord has sent all this evil on them
 now at the end of twenty years in which time solomon had put up the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house
  hiram king of tyre had given solomon cedar trees and cypress trees and gold as much as he had need of  king solomon gave hiram twenty towns in the land of galilee
 but when hiram came from tyre to see the towns which solomon had given him he was not pleased with them
 and he said what sort of towns are these which you have given me my brother so they were named the land of cabul to this day
 and hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold
 now this was the way of solomons system of forced work for the building of the lords house and of the kings house and the millo and the wall of jerusalem and megiddo and gezer 
 pharaoh king of egypt came and took gezer burning it down and putting to death the canaanites living in the town and he gave it for a bride offering to his daughter solomons wife 
  and solomon was the builder of gezer and beth horon the lower
 and baalath and tamar in the waste land in that land
 and all the store towns and the towns which solomon had for his war carriages and for his horsemen and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land under his rule
 as for the rest of the amorites the hittites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites who were not children of israel
 their children who were still in the land and whom the children of israel had not been able to put to complete destruction them did solomon put to forced work to this day
 but solomon did not put the children of israel to forced work they were the men of war his servants his captains and his chiefs captains of his war carriages and of his horsemen
 these were the chiefs of the overseers of solomons work five hundred and fifty in authority over the people who did the work
 at that time solomon made pharaohs daughter come up from the town of david to the house which he had made for her then he made the millo
 three times in the year it was solomons way to give burned offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had made to the lord causing his fire offering to go up on the altar before the lord
 and king solomon made a sea force of ships in ezion geber by eloth on the red sea in the land of edom
 hiram sent his servants who were experienced seamen in the sea force with solomons men
 and they came to ophir where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold and took it back to king solomon
 now there was a certain man of ramathaim a zuphite of the hill country of ephraim named elkanah he was the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephraimite
 and he had two wives one named hannah and the other peninnah and peninnah was the mother of children but hannah had no children
 now this man went up from his town every year to give worship and to make offerings to the lord of armies in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there
 and when the day came for elkanah to make his offering he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters their part of the feast
 but to hannah he gave one part though hannah was very dear to him but the lord had not let her have children
 and the other wife did everything possible to make her unhappy because the lord had not let her have children
 and year by year whenever she went up to the house of the lord she kept on attacking her so that hannah gave herself up to weeping and would take no food
 then her husband elkanah said to her hannah why are you weeping and why are you taking no food why is your heart troubled am i not more to you than ten sons
 so after they had taken food and wine in the guest room hannah got up now eli the priest was seated by the pillars of the doorway of the temple of the lord
 and with grief in her soul weeping bitterly she made her prayer to the lord
 and she made an oath and said o lord of armies if you will truly take note of the sorrow of your servant not turning away from me but keeping me in mind and will give me a man child then i will give him to the lord all the days of his life and his hair will never be cut
 now while she was a long time in prayer before the lord eli was watching her mouth
 for hannahs prayer came from her heart and though her lips were moving she made no sound so it seemed to eli that she was overcome with wine
 and eli said to her how long are you going to be the worse for drink put away the effects of your wine from you
 and hannah answering him said no my lord i am a woman whose spirit is broken with sorrow i have not taken wine or strong drink but i have been opening my heart before the lord
 do not take your servant to be a good for nothing woman for my words have come from my stored up sorrow and pain
 then eli said to her go in peace and may the god of israel give you an answer to the prayer you have made to him
 and she said may your servant have grace in your eyes so the woman went away and took part in the feast and her face was no longer sad
 and early in the morning they got up and after worshipping before the lord they went back to ramah to their house and elkanah had connection with his wife and the lord kept her in mind
 now the time came when hannah being with child gave birth to a son and she gave him the name samuel because she said i made a prayer to the lord for him
 and the man elkanah with all his family went up to make the years offering to the lord and to give effect to his oath
 but hannah did not go for she said to her husband i will not go till the child has been taken from the breast and then i will take him with me and put him before the lord where he may be for ever
 and her husband elkanah said to her do whatever seems right to you but not till you have taken him from the breast only may the lord do as he has said so the woman waiting there gave her son milk till he was old enough to be taken from the breast
 then when she had done so she took him with her with a three year old ox and an ephah of meal and a skin full of wine and took him to the house of the lord at shiloh now the child was still very young
 and when they had made an offering of the ox they took the child to eli
 and she said o my lord as your soul is living my lord i am that woman who was making a prayer to the lord here by your side
 my prayer was for this child and the lord has given him to me in answer to my request
 so i have given him to the lord for all his life he is the lords then he gave the lord worship there
 then samuel took the bottle of oil and put the oil on his head and gave him a kiss and said is not the lord with the holy oil making you ruler over israel his people and you will have authority over the people of the lord and you will make them safe from the hands of their attackers round about them and this will be the sign for you
 when you have gone away from me today you will see two men by the resting place of rachels body in the land of benjamin at zelzah and they will say to you the asses which you went in search of have come back and now your father caring no longer for the asses is troubled about you saying what am i to do about my son
 then you are to go on from there and when you come to the oak tree of tabor you will see three men going up to god to beth el one having with him three young goats and another three cakes of bread and another a skin full of wine
 they will say peace be with you and will give you two cakes of bread which you are to take from them
 after that you will come to gibeah the hill of god where an armed force of the philistines is stationed and when you come to the town you will see a band of prophets coming down from the high place with instruments of music before them and they will be acting like prophets
 and the spirit of the lord will come on you with power and you will be acting like a prophet with them and will be changed into another man
 and when these signs come to you see that you take the chance which is offered you for god is with you
 then you are to go down before me to gilgal where i will come to you for the offering of burned offerings and peace offerings go on waiting there for seven days till i come to you and make clear to you what you have to do
 and it came about that when he went away from samuel god gave him a changed heart and all those signs took place that day
 and when they came to gibeah a band of prophets came face to face with him and the spirit of god came on him with power and he took his place among them as a prophet
 now when sauls old friends saw him among the band of prophets the people said to one another what has come to saul the son of kish is even saul among the prophets
 and one of the people of that place said in answer and who is their father so it became a common saying is even saul among the prophets
 then going away from the prophets he came to the house
 and sauls fathers brother said to him and his servant where have you been and he said searching for the asses and when we saw no sign of them we came to samuel
 then he said and what did samuel say to you
 and saul answering him said he gave us word that the asses had come back but he said nothing to him of samuels words about the kingdom
 then samuel sent for the people to come together before the lord at mizpah
 and he said to the children of israel the lord the god of israel has said i took israel out of egypt and made you free from the hands of the egyptians and from all the kingdoms which kept you down
 but today you are turned away from your god who himself has been your saviour from all your troubles and sorrows and you have said to him put a king over us so now take your places before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands
 so samuel made all the tribes of israel come near and the tribe of benjamin was taken
 then he made the tribe of benjamin come near by families and the family of the matrites was taken and from them saul the son of kish was taken but when they went in search of him he was nowhere to be seen
 so they put another question to the lord is the man present here and the answer of the lord was he is keeping himself from view among the goods
 so they went quickly and made him come out and when he took his place among the people he was taller by a head than any of the people
 and samuel said to all the people do you see the man of the lords selection how there is no other like him among all the people and all the people with loud cries said long life to the king 
 then samuel gave the people the laws of the kingdom writing them in a book which he put in a safe place before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house
 and saul went to gibeah to his house and with him went the men of war whose hearts had been touched by god
 but certain good for nothing persons said how is this man to be our saviour and having no respect for him they gave him no offering
 then about a month after this nahash the ammonite came up and put his forces in position for attacking jabesh gilead and all the men of jabesh said to nahash make an agreement with us and we will be your servants
 and nahash the ammonite said to them i will make an agreement with you on this condition that all your right eyes are put out so that i may make it a cause of shame to all israel
 then the responsible men of jabesh said to him give us seven days so that we may send men to every part of israel and then if no one comes to our help we will come out to you
 so they sent representatives to sauls town gibeah and these gave the news to the people and all the people gave themselves to weeping
 now saul came from the field driving the oxen before him and he said why are the people weeping and they gave him word of what the men of jabesh had said
 and at their words the spirit of god came on saul with power and he became very angry
 and he took two oxen and cutting them up sent them through all the land of israel by the hand of runners saying if any man does not come out after saul and samuel this will be done to his oxen and the fear of the lord came on the people and they came out like one man
 and he had them numbered in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand
 then he said to the representatives who had come say to the men of jabesh gilead tomorrow by the time the sun is high you will be made safe and the representatives came and gave the news to the men of jabesh and they were glad
 so the men of jabesh said tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us whatever seems good to you
 now on the day after saul put the people into three bands and in the morning watch they came to the tents of the ammonites and they went on attacking them till the heat of the day and those who were not put to death were put to flight in every direction so that no two of them were together
 and the people said to samuel who was it who said is saul to be our king give the men up so that we may put them to death
 and saul said not a man is to be put to death today for today the lord has made israel safe
 then samuel said to the people come let us go to gilgal and there make the kingdom strong in the hands of saul
 so all the people went to gilgal and there in gilgal they made saul king before the lord and peace offerings were offered before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel were glad with great joy
 and samuel said to all israel you see that i have given ear to everything you said to me and have made a king over you
 and now see the king is before you and i am old and grey headed and my sons are with you i have been living before your eyes from my early days till now
 here i am give witness against me before the lord and before the man on whom he has put the holy oil whose ox or ass have i taken to whom have i been untrue who has been crushed down by me from whose hand have i taken a price for the blinding of my eyes i will give it all back to you
 and they said you have never been untrue to us or cruel to us you have taken nothing from any man
 then he said the lord is witness against you and the man on whom he has put the holy oil is witness this day that you have seen no wrong in me and they said he is witness
 and samuel said to the people the lord is witness who gave authority to moses and aaron and who took your fathers up out of the land of egypt
 keep your places now while i take up the argument with you before the lord and give you the story of the righteousness of the lord which he has made clear by his acts to you and to your fathers
 when jacob and his sons had come into egypt and were crushed by the egyptians the prayers of your fathers came up to the lord and the lord sent moses and aaron who took your fathers out of egypt and he put them into this place
 but they were false to the lord their god and he gave them up into the hands of sisera captain of the army of jabin king of hazor and into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the king of moab who made war against them
 then crying out to the lord they said we have done evil because we have been turned away from the lord worshipping the baals and the astartes but now make us safe from those who are against us and we will be your servants
 so the lord sent jerubbaal and barak and jephthah and samuel and took you out of the power of those who were fighting against you on every side and made you safe
 and when you saw that nahash the king of the ammonites was coming against you you said to me no more of this we will have a king for our ruler when the lord your god was your king
 here then is the king marked out by you the lord has put a king over you
 if in the fear of the lord you are his servants hearing his voice and not going against the orders of the lord but being true to the lord your god you and the king ruling over you then all will be well
 but if you do not give ear to the voice of the lord but go against his orders then the hand of the lord will be against you and against your king for your destruction as it was against your fathers
 now keep where you are and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes
 is it not now the time of the grain cutting my cry will go up to the lord and he will send thunder and rain so that you may see and be conscious of your great sin which you have done in the eyes of the lord in desiring a king for yourselves
 so samuel made prayer to the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people were in fear of the lord and of samuel
 and all the people said to samuel make prayer for us to the lord your god so that death may not overtake us for in addition to all our sins we have done this evil in desiring a king
 then samuel said to the people have no fear truly you have done evil but do not be turned away from the lord be his servants with all your heart
 and do not go from the right way turning to those false gods in which there is no profit and no salvation for they are false
 for the lord will not give his people up because of the honour of his name for it was the lords pleasure to make of you a people for himself
 and as for me never will i go against the orders of the lord by giving up my prayers for you but i will go on teaching you the good and right way
 only go in the fear of the lord and be his true servants with all your heart keeping in mind what great things he has done for you
 but if you still do evil destruction will overtake you and your king
 ***
 and saul took for himself three thousand men of israel of whom he kept two thousand with him in michmash and in the mountain of beth el and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah in the land of benjamin the rest of the people he sent back to their tents
 and jonathan made an attack on the armed force of the philistines stationed at gibeah and news was given to the philistines that the hebrews were turned against them and saul had a horn sounded through all the land
 and all israel had the news that saul had made an attack on the philistines and that israel was bitterly hated by the philistines and the people came together after saul to gilgal
 and the philistines came together to make war on israel three thousand war carriages and six thousand horsemen and an army of people like the sands of the sea in number they came up and took up their position in michmash to the east of beth aven
 when the men of israel saw the danger they were in  for the people were troubled  they took cover in cracks in the hillsides and in the woods and in rocks and holes and hollows
 and a great number of the people had gone over jordan to the land of gad and gilead but saul was still in gilgal and all the people went after him shaking in fear
 and he went on waiting there for seven days the time fixed by samuel but samuel did not come to gilgal and the people were starting to go away from him
 then saul said come here and give me the burned offering and the peace offerings and he made a burned offering to the lord
 and when the burned offering was ended samuel came and saul went out to see him and to give him a blessing
 and samuel said what have you done and saul said because i saw that the people were going away from me and you had not come at the time which had been fixed and the philistines had come together at michmash
 i said now the philistines will come down on me at gilgal and i have made no prayer for help to the lord and so forcing myself to do it i made a burned offering
 and samuel said to saul you have done a foolish thing you have not kept the rules which the lord your god gave you it was the purpose of the lord to make your authority over israel safe for ever
 but now your authority will not go on the lord searching for a man who is pleasing to him in every way has given him the place of ruler over his people because you have not done what the lord gave you orders to do
 then samuel went up from gilgal and the rest of the people went up after saul against the men of war and they came from gilgal to gibeah in the land of benjamin and saul took the number of the people who were with him about six hundred men
 and saul with jonathan his son and the people who were with them was waiting in geba in the land of benjamin but the tents of the philistines were in michmash
 and three bands of men came out from the philistines to make an attack one band went by the road which goes to ophrah into the land of shual
 and another went in the direction of beth horon and another went by the hill looking down on the valley of zeboiim in the direction of the waste land
 now there was no iron worker in all the land of israel for the philistines said for fear the hebrews make themselves swords or spears
 but all the israelites had to go to the philistines to get their ploughs and blades and axes and hooks made sharp
 for they had instruments for putting an edge on their ploughs and blades and forks and axes and for putting iron points on their ox driving rods
 so on the day of the fight at michmash not a sword or a spear was to be seen in the hands of any of the people with saul and jonathan only saul and his son jonathan had them
 and the armed force of the philistines went out to the narrow way of michmash
 now one day jonathan the son of saul said to the young man who was with him looking after his arms come let us go over to the philistine force over there but he said nothing to his father
 and saul was still waiting in the farthest part of geba under the fruit tree in migron there were about six hundred men with him
 and ahijah the son of ahitub brother of ichabod the son of phinehas the son of eli the priest of the lord in shiloh who had the ephod and the people had no idea that jonathan had gone
 now between the narrow roads over the mountains by which jonathan was making his way to the philistines forces there was a sharp overhanging rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side one was named bozez and the other seneh
 the one rock went up on the north in front of michmash and the other on the south in front of geba
 and jonathan said to his young servant who had his arms come let us go over to the armies of these men who have no circumcision it may be that the lord will give us help for there is no limit to his power the lord is able to give salvation by a great army or by a small band
 and his servant said to him do whatever is in your mind see i am with you in every impulse of your heart
 then jonathan said now we will go over to these men and let them see us
 if they say to us keep quiet where you are till we come to you then we will keep our places and not go up to them
 but if they say come up to us then we will go up for the lord has given them into our hands and this will be the sign to us
 and they let the philistine force see the two of them and the philistines said look  the hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have taken cover
 and the armed men of the force gave jonathan and his servant their answer saying come up here to us and we will let you see something then jonathan said to his servant come up after me for the lord has given them up into the hands of israel
 and jonathan went up gripping with his hands and his feet his servant going up after him and the philistines gave way before jonathan when he made an attack on them and his servant put them to death after him
 and at their first attack jonathan and his servant put to the sword about twenty men all inside the space of half an acre of land
 and there was great fear in the tents and in the field and among all the men of the armed force and the attackers were shaking with fear even the earth was moved with a great shaking and there was a fear as from god
 and the watchmen of saul looking out from geba in the land of benjamin saw all the army flowing away and running here and there
 then saul said to the people who were with him let everyone be numbered and let us see who has gone from us and when they had been numbered it was seen that jonathan and his servant were not there
 and saul said to ahijah let the ephod come here for he went before israel with the ephod at that time
 now while saul was talking to the priest the noise in the tents of the philistines became louder and louder and saul said to the priest take back your hand
 and saul and all the people with him came together and went forward to the fight and every mans sword was turned against the man at his side and there was a very great noise
 then the hebrews who had been with the philistines for some time and had gone up with them to their tents turning round were joined to those who were with saul and jonathan
 and all the men of israel who had taken cover in the hill country of ephraim hearing that the philistines had been put to flight went after them attacking them
 so the lord made israel safe that day and the fight went over to beth aven
 and all the people were with saul about twenty thousand men and the fight was general through all the hill country of ephraim but saul made a great error that day by putting the people under an oath saying let that man be cursed who takes food before evening comes and i have given punishment to those who are against me so the people had not a taste of food
 and there was honey on the face of the field and all the people came to the honey the bees having gone from it
 but not a man put his hand to his mouth for fear of the curse
 but jonathan having no knowledge of the oath his father had put on the people stretching out the rod which was in his hand put the end of it in the honey and put it to his mouth then his eyes were made bright
 then one of the people said to him your father put the people under an oath saying let that man be cursed who takes any food this day and the people were feeble needing food
 then jonathan said my father has made trouble come on the land now see how bright my eyes have become because i have taken a little of this honey
 how much more if the people had freely taken their food from the goods of those who were fighting against them  would there not have been much greater destruction among the philistines
 that day they overcame the philistines from michmash to aijalon and the people were feeble from need of food
 and rushing at the goods taken in the fight the people took oxen and sheep and young oxen and put them to death there on the earth and had a meal taking the flesh with the blood in it
 then it was said to saul see the people are sinning against the lord taking the blood with the flesh and he said to those who gave him the news now let a great stone be rolled to me here
 and saul said go about among the people and say to them let every man come here to me with his ox and his sheep and put them to death here and take his meal do no sin against the lord by taking the blood with the flesh so all the people took their oxen with them that night and put them to death there
 and saul put up an altar to the lord this was the first altar which he put up to the lord
 and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night attacking them till the morning till there is not a man of them living and they said do whatever seems right to you then the priest said let us come near to god
 and saul desiring directions from god said am i to go down after the philistines will you give them up into the hands of israel but he gave him no answer that day
 and saul said come near all you chiefs of the people and let us get word from god and see in whom is this sin today
 for by the living lord the saviour of israel even if the sinner is jonathan my son death will certainly be his fate but not a man among all the people gave him any answer
 then he said to all israel you be on one side and i with jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said to saul do whatever seems good to you
 then saul said to the lord the god of israel why have you not given me an answer today if the sin is in me or in jonathan my son o lord god of israel give urim and if it is in your people israel give thummim and by the decision of the lord saul and jonathan were marked out and the people went free
 and saul said give your decision between my son jonathan and me and jonathan was taken
 then saul said to jonathan give me an account of what you have done and jonathan gave him the story and said certainly i took a little honey on the end of my rod and now death is to be my fate
 and saul said may gods punishment be on me if death is not your fate jonathan
 and the people said to saul is death to come to jonathan the worker of this great salvation for israel let it not be so by the living lord not one hair of his head is to be touched for he has been working with god today so the people kept jonathan from death
 then saul turning back went after the philistines no longer and the philistines went back to their place
 now when saul had taken his place as ruler of israel he made war on those who were against him on every side moab and the ammonites and edom and the kings of zobah and the philistines and whichever way he went he overcame them
 and he did great things and overcame the amalekites and made israel safe from the hands of their attackers
 now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishvi and malchi shua and these are the names of his daughters the older was named merab and the younger michal
 the name of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz the captain of his army was abner the son of ner brother of sauls father
 kish the father of saul and ner the father of abner were sons of abiel
 all through the life of saul there was bitter war against the philistines and whenever saul saw any strong man or any good fighting man he kept him near himself
 and samuel said to saul the lord sent me to put the holy oil on you and to make you king over his people over israel so give ear now to the words of the lord
 the lord of armies says i will give punishment to amalek for what he did to israel fighting against him on the way when israel came out of egypt
 go now and put amalek to the sword putting to the curse all they have without mercy put to death every man and woman every child and baby at the breast every ox and sheep camel and ass
 and saul sent for the people and had them numbered in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah
 and saul came to the town of amalek and took up his position in the valley secretly
 and saul said to the kenites go away take yourselves out from among the amalekites or destruction will overtake you with them for you were kind to the children of israel when they came out of egypt so the kenites went away from among the amalekites
 and saul made an attack on the amalekites from havilah on the road to shur which is before egypt
 he took agag king of the amalekites prisoner and put all the people to the sword without mercy
 but saul and the people did not put agag to death and they kept the best of the sheep and the oxen and the fat beasts and the lambs and whatever was good not desiring to put them to the curse but everything which was bad and of no use they put to the curse
 then the lord said to samuel
 it is no longer my pleasure for saul to be king for he is turned back from going in my ways and has not done my orders and samuel was very sad crying to the lord in prayer all night
 and early in the morning he got up and went to saul and word was given to samuel that saul had come to carmel and put up a pillar and had gone from there down to gilgal
 and samuel came to saul and saul said to him may the blessing of the lord be with you i have done what was ordered by the lord
 and samuel said what then is this sound of the crying of sheep and the noise of oxen which comes to my ears
 and saul said they have taken them from the amalekites for the people have kept the best of the sheep and of the oxen as an offering to the lord your god all the rest we have given up to destruction
 then samuel said to saul say no more  let me give you word of what the lord has said to me this night and he said to him say on
 and samuel said though you may seem little to yourself are you not head of the tribes of israel for the lord with the holy oil made you king over israel
 and the lord sent you on a journey and said go and put to the curse those sinners the amalekites fighting against them till every one is dead
 why then did you not do the orders of the lord but by violently taking their goods did evil in the eyes of the lord
 and saul said truly i have done the orders of the lord and have gone the way the lord sent me i have taken agag the king of amalek and have given the amalekites up to destruction
 but the people took some of their goods sheep and oxen the chief of the things which were put to the curse to make an offering of them to the lord your god in gilgal
 and samuel said has the lord as much delight in offerings and burned offerings as in the doing of his orders truly to do his pleasure is better than to make offerings and to give ear to him than the fat of sheep
 for to go against his orders is like the sin of those who make use of secret arts and pride is like giving worship to images because you have put away from you the word of the lord he has put you from your place as king
 and saul said to samuel great is my sin for i have gone against the orders of the lord and against your words because fearing the people i did what they said
 so now let my sin have forgiveness and go back with me to give worship to the lord
 and samuel said to saul i will not go back with you for you have put away from you the word of the lord and the lord has put you from your place as king over israel
 and when samuel was turning round to go away saul took the skirt of his robe in his hand and the cloth came away
 and samuel said to him the lord has taken away the kingdom of israel from you this day by force and has given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than you
 and further the glory of israel will not say what is false and his purpose may not be changed for he is not a man whose purpose may be changed
 then he said great is my sin but still give me honour now before the heads of my people and before israel and come back with me so that i may give worship to the lord your god
 so samuel went back after saul and saul gave worship to the lord
 then samuel said make agag the king of the amalekites come here to me and agag came to him shaking with fear and agag said truly the pain of death is past
 and samuel said as your sword has made women without children so now your mother will be without children among women and agag was cut up by samuel bone from bone before the lord in gilgal
 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house in gibeah in the land of saul
 and samuel never saw saul again till the day of his death but samuel was sorrowing for saul and it was no longer the lords pleasure for saul to be king over israel
 and the lord said to samuel how long will you go on sorrowing for saul seeing that i have put him from his place as king over israel take oil in your vessel and go i will send you to jesse the beth lehemite for i have got a king for myself among his sons
 and samuel said how is it possible for me to go if saul gets news of it he will put me to death and the lord said take a young cow with you and say i have come to make an offering to the lord
 and send for jesse to be present at the offering and i will make clear to you what you are to do and you are to put the holy oil on him whose name i give you
 and samuel did as the lord said and came to beth lehem and the responsible men of the town came out to him in fear and said do you come in peace
 and he said in peace i have come to make an offering to the lord make yourselves clean and come with me to make the offering and he made jesse and his sons clean and sent for them to be present at the offering
 now when they came looking at eliab he said clearly the man of the lords selection is before him
 but the lord said to samuel do not take note of his face or how tall he is because i will not have him for the lords view is not mans man takes note of the outer form but the lord sees the heart
 then jesse sent for abinadab and made him come before samuel and he said the lord has not taken this one
 then jesse made shammah come before him and he said the lord has not taken this one
 and jesse made his seven sons come before samuel and samuel said to jesse the lord has not taken any of these
 then samuel said to jesse are all your children here and he said there is still the youngest and he is looking after the sheep and samuel said to jesse send and make him come here for we will not take our seats till he is here
 so he sent and made him come in now he had red hair and beautiful eyes and pleasing looks and the lord said come put the oil on him for this is he
 then samuel took the bottle of oil and put the oil on him there among his brothers and from that day the spirit of the lord came on david with power so samuel went back to ramah
 now the spirit of the lord had gone from saul and an evil spirit from the lord was troubling him
 and sauls servants said to him see now an evil spirit from god is troubling you
 now give orders to your servants who are here before you to go in search of a man who is an expert player on a corded instrument and it will be that when the evil spirit from god is on you he will make music for you on his instrument and you will get well
 and saul said to his servants then get me a man who is an expert player and make him come to me
 then one of the servants in answer said i have seen a son of jesse the beth lehemite who is expert at playing and a strong man and a man of war and he is wise in his words and pleasing in looks and the lord is with him
 so saul sent his servants to jesse and said send me your son david who is with the sheep
 and jesse took five cakes of bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them to saul by david
 and david came to saul waiting before him and he became very dear to saul who made him his servant giving him the care of his arms
 and saul sent to jesse saying let david be with me for he is pleasing to me
 and whenever the evil spirit from god came on saul david took his instrument and made music so new life came to saul and he got well and the evil spirit went away from him
 now the philistines got their armies together for war and came together at socoh in the land of judah and took up their position between socoh and azekah in ephes dammim
 and saul and the men of israel came together and took up their position in the valley of elah and put their forces in order against the philistines
 the philistines were stationed on the mountain on one side and israel on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them
 and a fighter came out from the tents of the philistines named goliath of gath he was more than six cubits tall
 and he had a head dress of brass on his head and he was dressed in a coat of metal the weight of which was five thousand shekels of brass
 his legs were covered with plates of brass and hanging on his back was a javelin of brass
 the stem of his spear was as long as a cloth workers rod and its head was made of six hundred shekels weight of iron and one went before him with his body cover
 he took up his position and in a loud voice said to the armies of israel why have you come out to make war am i not a philistine and you servants of saul send out a man for yourselves and let him come down to me
 if he is able to have a fight with me and overcome me then we will be your servants but if i am able to overcome him then you will be our servants and do work for us
 and the philistine said i have put to shame the armies of israel this day give me a man so that we may have a fight together
 and saul and all israel hearing those words of the philistine were troubled and full of fear
 now david was the son of that ephrathite of beth lehem judah named jesse who had eight sons and he was an old man in sauls day and far on in years
 and the three oldest sons of jesse had gone with saul to the fight the names of the three who went to the fight were eliab the oldest and abinadab the second and shammah the third
 and david was the youngest and the three oldest were with sauls army
 now david went to and from saul looking after his fathers sheep at beth lehem
 and the philistine came near every morning and evening for forty days
 and jesse said to his son david take now for your brothers an ephah of this dry grain and these ten cakes of bread and go quickly with them to the tents to your brothers
 and take these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand and see how your brothers are and come back with a sign to say how they are
 now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines
 and david got up early in the morning and giving the sheep into the care of a keeper took the things and went as jesse had said and he came to the lines where the carts were when the army was going out to the fight giving their war cry
 and israel and the philistines had put their forces in position army against army
 and david gave his parcels into the hands of the keeper of the army stores and went running to the army and came to his brothers to get knowledge about them
 and while he was talking to them the fighter the philistine of gath goliath by name came out from the philistines lines and said the same words in davids hearing
 and all the men of israel when they saw him went in flight overcome with fear
 and the men of israel said have you seen this man clearly he has come out to put shame on israel and it is certain that if any man overcomes him the king will give that man great wealth and will give him his daughter and make his fathers family free in israel
 and david said to the men near him what will be done to the man who overcomes this philistine and takes away the shame from israel for who is this philistine a man without circumcision that he has put shame on the armies of the living god
 and the people gave him this answer so it will be done to the man who overcomes him
 and eliab his oldest brother hearing what david said to the men was moved to wrath against david and said why have you come here into whose care have you given that little flock of sheep in the waste land i have knowledge of your pride and the evil of your heart you have come down to see the fight
 and david said what have i done now was it not only a word
 and turning away from him to one of the other men he said the same words and the people gave him the same answer
 and hearing what david said they gave saul word of it and he sent for him
 and david said to saul let no mans heart become feeble because of him i your servant will go out and have a fight with this philistine
 and saul said to david you are not able to go out against this philistine and have a fight with him for you are only a boy and he has been a man of war from his earliest days
 and david said to saul your servant has been keeper of his fathers sheep and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock
 i went out after him and overcame him and took it out of his mouth and if turning on me he came at me i took him by the hair and overcame him and put him to death
 your servant has overcome lion and bear and the fate of this philistine who is without circumcision will be like theirs seeing that he has put shame on the armies of the living god
 and david said the lord who kept me safe from the grip of the lion and the bear will be my saviour from the hands of this philistine and saul said to david go  and may the lord be with you
 then saul gave david his clothing of war and put a head dress of brass on his head and had him clothed with a coat of metal
 and david took sauls sword and put the band round him over the metal coat and was unable to go forward for he was not used to them then david said to saul it is not possible for me to go out with these for i am not used to them so david took them off
 then he took his stick in his hand and got five smooth stones from the bed of the stream and put them in a bag such as is used by sheep keepers and in his hand was a leather band used for sending stones and so he went in the direction of the philistine
 and the philistine came nearer to david and the man who had his body cover went before him
 and when the philistine taking note saw david he had a poor opinion of him for he was only a boy red haired and good looking
 and the philistine said to david am i a dog that you come out to me with sticks and the philistine put curses on david by all his gods
 and the philistine said to david come here to me and i will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field
 then david said to the philistine you come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin but i come to you in the name of the lord of armies the god of the armies of israel on which you have put shame
 this day the lord will give you up into my hands and i will overcome you and take your head off you and i will give the bodies of the philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth today so that all the earth may see that israel has a god
 and all these people who are here today may see that the lord does not give salvation by sword and spear for the fight is the lords and he will give you up into our hands
 now when the philistine made a move and came near to david david quickly went at a run in the direction of the army meeting the philistine face to face
 and david put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and sent it from his leather band straight at the philistine and the stone went deep into his brow and he went down to the earth falling on his face
 so david overcame the philistine with his leather band and a stone wounding the philistine and causing his death but david had no sword in his hand
 so running up to the philistine and putting his foot on him david took his sword out of its cover and put him to death cutting off his head with it and when the philistines saw that their fighter was dead they went in flight
 and the men of israel and of judah got up and gave a cry and went after the philistines as far as gath and the town doors of ekron and the wounded of the philistines were falling down by the road from shaaraim all the way to gath and ekron
 then the children of israel came back from going after the philistines and took their goods from the tents
 and david took the head of the philistine to jerusalem but the metal war dress and the arms he put in his tent
 and when saul saw david going out against the philistine he said to abner the captain of the army abner whose son is this young man and abner said on your life o king i have no idea
 and the king said make search and see whose son this young man is
 and when david was coming back after the destruction of the philistine abner took him to saul with the head of the philistine in his hand
 and saul said to him young man whose son are you and david in answer said i am the son of your servant jesse of beth lehem
 now after davids talk with saul was ended the soul of jonathan was joined with the soul of david and david became as dear to him as his very life
 and that day saul took david and would not let him go back to his fathers house
 then jonathan and david made an agreement together because of jonathans love for david
 and jonathan took off the robe he had on and gave it to david with all his military dress even to his sword and his bow and the band round his body
 and david went wherever saul sent him and did wisely and saul put him at the head of his men of war and this was pleasing to all the people as well as to sauls servants
 now on their way when david came back after the destruction of the philistine the women came out of all the towns of israel with songs and dances meeting david with melody and joy and instruments of music
 and the women answering one another in their song said saul has put to death his thousands and david his tens of thousands
 and saul was very angry and this saying was unpleasing to him and he said they have given david credit for tens of thousands and to me for only thousands what more is there for him but the kingdom
 and from that day saul was looking with envy on david
 now on the day after an evil spirit from god came on saul with great force and he was acting like a prophet among the men of his house while david was making music for him as he did day by day and saul had his spear in his hand
 and saul balancing the spear in his hand said i will give david a blow pinning him to the wall and david got away from him twice
 and saul went in fear of david because the lord was with david and had gone away from saul
 so saul sent him away and made him a captain over a thousand and he went about his business before the people
 and in all his undertakings david did wisely and the lord was with him
 and when saul saw how wisely he did he was in fear of him
 but david was loved by all israel and judah for he went out and came in before them
 and saul said to david here is my oldest daughter merab whom i will give you for your wife only be strong for me fighting in the lords wars for saul said let it not be through me that his fate comes to him but through the philistines
 and david said to saul who am i and what is my fathers family in israel that i am to be son in law to the king
 but when the time came to give merab sauls daughter to david she was given to adriel of meholath
 and sauls daughter michal was in love with david and saul had word of it and was pleased
 and saul said i will give her to him so that she may be a cause of danger to him and so that the hands of the philistines may be against him so saul said to david today you are to become my son in law for the second time
 and saul gave his servants orders saying have talk with david secretly and say to him see how the king has delight in you and how you are loved by all his servants then be the kings son in law
 and sauls servants said these things to david and david said does it seem to you a small thing to be the kings son in law seeing that i am a poor man of no great name
 and the servants of saul gave him an account of what david had said
 and saul said then say to david the king has no desire for any bride price but only for the private parts of a hundred philistines so that the king may get the better of his haters but it was in sauls mind that david might come to his end by the hands of the philistines
 and when his servants said these words to david he was well pleased to be the son in law of the king and the days were still not past
 so david and his men got up and went and put to death two hundred of the philistines and david took their private parts and gave the full number of them to the king so that he might be the kings son in law and saul gave him his daughter michal for his wife
 and it was clear to saul that the lord was with david and he was loved by all israel
 and sauls fear of david became all the greater and he went on hating him day by day
 then the rulers of the philistines went out to war and whenever they went out david did more wisely than all the other servants of saul so that his name became greatly honoured
 and saul gave orders to his son jonathan and to all his servants to put david to death but sauls son jonathan had great delight in david
 and jonathan said to david saul my father is purposing your death so now take care in the morning and keep yourself safe in a secret place
 and i will go out and take my place by my fathers side in the field near where you are and i will get into talk with my father about you and when i see how things are i will give you word
 and jonathan gave his father saul a good account of david and said to him let not the king do wrong against his servant against david because he has done you no wrong and all his acts have had a good outcome for you
 for he put his life in danger and overcame the philistine and the lord gave all israel salvation you saw it and were glad why then are you sinning against him who has done no wrong desiring the death of david without cause
 and saul gave ear to the voice of jonathan and said with an oath by the living lord he is not to be put to death
 then jonathan sent for david and gave him word of all these things and jonathan took david to saul who kept him by his side as in the past
 and there was war again and david went out fighting the philistines causing great destruction among them and they went in flight before him
 and an evil spirit from the lord came on saul when he was seated in his house with his spear in his hand and david made music for him
 and saul would have sent his spear through him pinning him to the wall but he got away and the spear went into the wall and that night david went in flight and got away
 then in that night saul sent men to davids house to keep watch on him so as to put him to death in the morning and davids wife michal said to him if you do not go away to a safe place tonight you will be put to death in the morning
 so michal let david down through the window and he went in flight and got away
 then michal took the image and put it in the bed with a cushion of goats hair at its head and she put clothing over it
 and when saul sent men to take david she said he is ill
 and saul sent his men to see david saying do not come back without him take him in his bed so that i may put him to death
 and when the men came in there was the image in the bed with the cushion of goats hair at its head
 and saul said to michal why have you been false to me letting my hater go and get safely away and in answer michal said to saul he said to me let me go or i will put you to death
 so david went in flight and got away and came to ramah to samuel and gave him an account of all saul had done to him and he and samuel went and were living in naioth
 and word was given to saul that david was at naioth in ramah
 and saul sent men to take david and when they saw the band of prophets at work with samuel in his place at their head the spirit of god came on sauls men and they became like prophets
 and saul having news of this sent other men who in the same way became like prophets and a third time saul sent men and they like the others became like prophets
 then he himself went to ramah and came to the great water spring in secu and questioning the people he said where are samuel and david and one said they are at naioth in ramah
 and he went on from there to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god came on him and he went on acting like a prophet till he came to naioth in ramah
 and he took off his clothing acting like a prophet before samuel and falling down he was stretched out without his clothing all that day and all that night this is the reason for the saying is even saul among the prophets
 and hannah in prayer before the lord said my heart is glad in the lord my horn is lifted up in the lord my mouth is open wide over my haters because my joy is in your salvation
 no other is holy as the lord for there is no other god but you there is no rock like our god
 say no more words of pride let not uncontrolled sayings come out of your mouths for the lord is a god of knowledge by him acts are judged
 the bows of the men of war are broken and the feeble are clothed with strength
 those who were full are offering themselves as servants for bread those who were in need are at rest truly she who had no children has become the mother of seven and she who had a family is wasted with sorrow
 the lord is the giver of death and life sending men down to the underworld and lifting them up
 the lord gives wealth and takes a mans goods from him crushing men down and again lifting them up
 lifting the poor out of the dust and him who is in need out of the lowest place to give them their place among rulers and for their heritage the seat of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he has made them the base of the world
 he will keep the feet of his holy ones but the evil doers will come to their end in the dark night for by strength no man will overcome
 those who make war against the lord will be broken against them he will send his thunder from heaven the lord will be judge of the ends of the earth he will give strength to his king lifting up the horn of him on whom the holy oil has been put
 then elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child became the servant of the lord under the direction of eli the priest
 now the sons of eli were evil and good for nothing men having no knowledge of the lord
 and the priests way with the people was this when any man made an offering the priests servant came while the flesh was being cooked having in his hand a meat hook with three teeth
 this he put into the pot and everything which came up on the hook the priest took for himself this they did in shiloh to all the israelites who came there
 and more than this before the fat was burned the priests servant would come and say to the man who was making the offering give me some of the flesh to be cooked for the priest he has no taste for meat cooked in water but would have you give it uncooked
 and if the man said to him first let the fat be burned then take as much as you will then the servant would say no you are to give it to me now or i will take it by force
 and the sin of these young men was very great before the lord for they gave no honour to the lords offerings
 but samuel did the work of the lords house while he was a child dressed in a linen ephod
 and his mother made him a little robe and took it to him every year when she came with her husband for the years offering
 and every year eli gave elkanah and his wife a blessing saying may the lord give you offspring by this woman in exchange for the child you have given to the lord and they went back to their house
 and the lord had mercy on hannah and she gave birth to three sons and two daughters and the young samuel became older before the lord
 now eli was very old and he had news from time to time of what his sons were doing to all israel
 and he said to them why are you doing such things for from all this people i get accounts of your evil ways
 no my sons the account which is given me which the lords people are sending about is not good
 if one man does wrong to another god will be his judge but if a mans sin is against the lord who will take up his cause but they gave no attention to the voice of their father for it was the lords purpose to send destruction on them
 and the young samuel becoming older had the approval of the lord and of men
 and a man of god came to eli and said to him the lord says did i let myself be seen by your fathers people when they were in egypt servants in pharaohs house
 did i take him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest and to go up to my altar to make the smoke of the offerings go up and to take up the ephod did i give to your fathers family all the offerings made by fire by the children of israel
 why then are you looking with envy on my offerings of meat and of meal which were ordered by my word honouring your sons before me and making yourselves fat with all the best of the offerings of israel my people
 for this reason the lord god of israel has said truly i did say that your family and your fathers people would have their place before me for ever but now the lord says let it not be so i will give honour to those by whom i am honoured and those who have no respect for me will be of small value in my eyes
 see the days are coming when your arm and the arm of your fathers people will be cut off
 and never again will there be an old man in your family
 but one man of your family will not be cut off by my hand and his eyes will be made dark and grief will be in his heart and all the offspring of your family will come to their end by the sword of men
 and this will be the sign to you which will come on hophni and phinehas your sons death will overtake them on the same day
 and i will make a true priest for myself one who will do what is in my heart and in my mind and i will make for him a family which will not come to an end and his place will be before my holy one for ever
 then it will be that the rest of your family anyone who has not been cut off will go down on his knees to him for a bit of silver or a bit of bread and say be pleased to put me into one of the priests places so that i may have a little food
 and david went in flight from naioth in ramah and came to jonathan and said what have i done what is my crime and my sin against your father that he is attempting to take my life
 and he said to him far be the thought you will not be put to death see my father does nothing great or small without giving me word of it would he keep this secret from me it is not so
 but david took his oath again and said your father sees that i am dear to you so he says to himself let jonathan have no idea of this for it will be a grief to him but as the lord is living and as your soul is living there is only a step between me and death
 then jonathan said to david whatever your desire is i will do it for you
 and david said to jonathan tomorrow is the new moon and i will not be seated with the king at his table but let me go to a safe place in the country till the evening
 and if your father takes note of the fact that i am away say david made a request to me for himself that he might go to beth lehem to his town for it is the time when his family make their offering year by year
 if he says it is well your servant will be at peace but if he is angry then it will be clear to you that he has an evil purpose in mind against me
 so then be kind to your servant for you have been united with your servant in an agreement made before the lord but if there is any wrongdoing in me put me to death yourself why take me to your father
 and jonathan said do not have such a thought for if i saw that my father was designing evil against you would i not give you word of it
 then david said to jonathan who will give me word if your father gives you a rough answer
 and jonathan said to david come let us go out into the country and the two of them went out together into the open country
 and jonathan said to david may the lord the god of israel be witness when i have had a chance of talking to my father about this time tomorrow if his feelings to david are good will i not send and give you the news
 may the lords punishment be on jonathan if it is my fathers pleasure to do you evil and i do not give you word of it and send you away so that you may go in peace and may the lord be with you as he has been with my father
 and may you while i am still living o may you be kind to me as the lord is kind and keep me from death 
 and let not your mercy ever be cut off from my family even when the lord has sent destruction on all davids haters cutting them off from the face of the earth
 and if it comes about that the name of jonathan is cut off from the family of david the lord will make david responsible
 and jonathan again took an oath to david because of his love for him for david was as dear to him as his very soul
 then jonathan said to him tomorrow is the new moon and it will be seen that you are not present for there will be no one in your seat
 and on the third day it will be specially noted and you will go to the place where you took cover when the other business was in hand waiting by the hill over there
 and on the third day i will send arrows from my bow against its side as if at a mark
 and i will send my boy to have a look for the arrow and if i say to him see the arrow is on this side of you take it up  then you may come for there is peace for you and no evil by the living lord
 but if i say to the boy see the arrow has gone past you then go on your way for the lord has sent you away
 as for what you and i were talking of the lord is between you and me for ever
 so david went to a secret place in the country and when the new moon came the king took his place at the feast
 and the king took his seat as at other times by the wall and jonathan was in front and abner was seated by sauls side but there was no one in davids seat
 but saul said nothing that day for his thought was something has taken place making him unclean it is clear that he is not clean
 and on the day after the new moon that is the second day there was still no one in davids seat and saul said to his son jonathan why has the son of jesse not come to the feast yesterday or today
 and answering saul jonathan said he made a request to me that he might go to beth lehem
 saying our family is making an offering in the town and my brothers have given me orders to be there so now if i have grace in your eyes let me go away and see my brothers this is why he has not come to the kings table
 then saul was moved to wrath against jonathan and he said to him you son of an evil and uncontrolled woman have i not seen how you have given your love to the son of jesse to your shame and the shame of your mother
 for while the son of jesse is living on the earth your position is unsafe and your kingdom is in danger so make him come here to me for it is certainly right for him to be put to death
 and jonathan answering his father saul said to him why is he to be put to death what has he done
 and saul pointing his spear at him made an attempt to give him a wound from which it was clear to jonathan that his fathers purpose was to put david to death
 so jonathan got up from the table burning with wrath and took no part in the feast the second day of the month being full of grief for david because his father had put shame on him
 now in the morning jonathan went out into the fields at the time he had said to david and he had a little boy with him
 and he said to the boy go and get the arrow i let loose from my bow and while the boy was running he sent an arrow past him
 and when the boy came to the place where the arrow was jonathan crying out after the boy said has it not gone past you
 and jonathan went on crying out after the boy be quick do not keep waiting about go quickly and jonathans boy got the arrow and came back to his master
 but the boy had no idea what was going on only jonathan and david had knowledge of it
 and jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and said to him take these and go back to the town
 and when the boy had gone david came from his secret place by the hill and falling to the earth went down on his face three times and they gave one another a kiss weeping together till davids grief was the greater
 and jonathan said to david go in peace for we two have taken an oath in the name of the lord saying the lord will be between me and you and between my seed and your seed for ever then david went away and jonathan went into the town
 then david came to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was full of fear at meeting david and said to him why are you by yourself having no man with you
 and david said to ahimelech the priest the king has given me orders and has said to me say nothing to anyone about the business on which i am sending you and the orders i have given you and a certain place has been fixed to which the young men are to go
 so now if you have here five cakes of bread give them into my hand or whatever you have
 and the priest answering david said i have no common bread here but there is holy bread if only the young men have kept themselves from women
 and david in answer said to the priest certainly women have been kept from us and as has been done before when i have gone out the arms of the young men were made holy even though it was a common journey how much more today will their arms be made holy
 so the priest gave him the holy bread there was no other only the holy bread which had been taken from before the lord so that new bread might be put in its place on the day when it was taken away
 now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day kept back before the lord his name was doeg an edomite the strongest of sauls runners
 and david said to ahimelech have you no sword or spear with you here for i have come without my sword and other arms because the kings business had to be done quickly
 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom you put to death in the valley of elah is here folded in a cloth at the back of the ephod take that if you will for there is no other sword here and david said there is no other sword like that give it to me
 then david got up and went in flight that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath
 and the servants of achish said to him is not this david the king of the land did they not make songs about him in their dances saying saul has put to death thousands and david tens of thousands
 and david took these words to heart fearing achish the king of gath
 so changing his behaviour before them he made it seem as if he was off his head hammering on the doors of the town and letting the water from his mouth go down his chin
 then achish said to his servants look  the man is clearly off his head why have you let him come before me
 are there not enough unbalanced men about me that you have let this person come and do such tricks before me is such a man to come into my house
 so david went away from there and took cover in a strong place at adullam and his brothers and all his fathers people hearing of it went down to him there
 and everyone who was in trouble and everyone who was in debt and everyone who was bitter in soul came together to him and he became captain over them about four hundred men were joined to him
 and from there david went to mizpeh in the land of moab and he said to the king of moab let my father and mother come and make their living place with you till it is clear to me what god will do for me
 and he took them to the king of moab and they went on living with him while david was in his safe place
 and the prophet gad said to david do not go on living in this place but go into the land of judah then david went away and came to the woodland of hereth
 and news was given to saul that david had been seen and the men who were with him now saul was in gibeah seated under the tree in the high place with his spear in his hand and all his servants were in their places before him
 then saul said to his servants who were there about him give ear now you benjamites will the son of jesse give to every one of you fields and vine gardens will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands
 that all of you have made designs against me and not one of you gave me word when my son made an agreement with the son of jesse and not one of you has pity for me or has made my eyes open to the fact that my servant has been moved by my son against me as at this day
 then doeg the edomite who was by the side of the servants of saul in answer said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub
 and he got directions from the lord for him and gave him food and put in his hand the sword of goliath the philistine
 then the king sent for ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and for all the men of his fathers family who were priests in nob and they all came to the king
 and saul said give ear now o son of ahitub and answering he said here i am my lord
 and saul said to him why have you made designs against me with the son of jesse giving him food and a sword and getting directions from the lord for him and helping him to take up arms against me and to be on the watch to make a secret attack on me as he is doing now
 then ahimelech answering said to the king who among all your servants is so true to you as david who is the kings son in law and is a captain of your armed men and has a place of honour in your house
 is this the first time i have got directions from god for him far be the thought  let the king make no such statement against his servant or my fathers family for your servant has no knowledge great or small of this thing
 and the king said you will certainly be put to death ahimelech you and all your fathers family
 then the king said to the runners who were waiting near him put the priests of the lord to death because they are on davids side and having knowledge of his flight did not give me word of it but the kings servants would not put out their hands to make an attack on the lords priests
 then the king said to doeg you are to put the priests to death and doeg the edomite turning on the priests and attacking them put to death that day eighty five men who took up the ephod
 and nob the town of the priests he put to the sword all the men and women children and babies at the breast and oxen and asses and sheep
 and abiathar one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub got away and went in flight after david
 and gave him the news of how saul had put to death the lords priests
 and david said to abiathar i was certain that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would take the news to saul i am responsible for the lives of all your fathers family
 keep here with me and have no fear for he who has designs on my life has designs on yours but with me you will be safe
 and they sent word to david saying the philistines are fighting against keilah and taking the grain from the grain floors
 so david questioning the lord said am i to go and make an attack on these philistines and the lord said to david go and make an attack on the philistines so that keilah may be kept from falling into their hands
 and davids men said to him even here in judah we are full of fear how much more then if we go to keilah against the armies of the philistines
 then david put the question to the lord again and the lord answering said up  go down to keilah for i will give the philistines into your hands
 so david and his men went to keilah and had a fight with the philistines and took away their cattle and put them to the sword with great destruction so david was the saviour of the people of keilah
 now when abiathar the son of ahimelech went in flight to david he came down to keilah with the ephod in his hand
 and news was given to saul that david had come to keilah and saul said now god has given him into my hands for by going into a walled town with locked doors he has let himself be shut in
 and saul sent for all the people to come to the fight and go down to keilah to make an attack on david and his men
 and it was clear to david that saul had evil designs against him and he said to abiathar the priest come here with the ephod
 then david said o lord the god of israel news has been given to your servant that it is sauls purpose to come to keilah and send destruction on the town because of me
 and now is it true as they have said to me that saul is coming o lord the god of israel give ear to your servant and say if these things are so and the lord said he is coming down
 then david said will the men of keilah give me and my men up to saul and the lord said they will give you up
 then david and his men about six hundred of them went out of keilah and got away wherever they were able to go and saul hearing that david had got away from keilah did not go there
 and david kept in the waste land in safe places waiting in the hill country in the waste land of ziph and saul was searching for him every day but god did not give him up into his hands
 and david was full of fear in the knowledge that saul had come out to take his life and david was in the waste land of ziph in horesh
 and sauls son jonathan went to david in horesh and made his hands strong in god
 and said to him have no fear for saul my father will not get you into his power and you will be king of israel and i will be by your side and my father saul is certain of this
 and the two of them made an agreement before the lord and david went on living in horesh and jonathan went back to his house
 then the ziphites came up to gibeah to see saul and said is not david living secretly among us in the strong places in horesh in the hill of hachilah to the south of the waste land
 so now o king have your souls desire and come down and we for our part will give him up into the kings hands
 and saul said the lords blessing will be yours for you have had pity on me
 go now and take more steps and see where he is living for they say that he is expert in deceit
 so take care to get knowledge of all the secret places where he is taking cover and be certain to come back to me and i will go with you and without doubt if he is anywhere in the land i will get him among all the families of judah
 and they went back and came to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the waste land of maon in the dry land south of the waste land
 and saul and his men went in search of him and david had word of it so he came down to the rock in the waste land of maon and saul hearing of this went after david into the waste land of maon
 and saul and his men went on one side of the mountain and david and his men went on the other and davids purpose was to get away as quickly as possible for fear of saul for saul and his men were making a circle round david and his men in order to take them
 but a man came to saul saying be quick and come for the philistines have made an attack on the land
 so turning back from going after david saul went against the philistines so that place was named sela hammah lekoth
 and from there david went up and took cover in the safe place of en gedi
 now when saul came back from fighting the philistines news was given him that david was in the waste land of en gedi
 then saul took three thousand of the best men out of all israel and went in search of david and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats
 and on the way he came to a place where sheep were kept where there was a hollow in the rock and saul went in for a private purpose now david and his men were in the deepest part of the hollow
 and davids men said to him now is the time when the lord says to you i will give up your hater into your hands to do with him whatever seems good to you then david getting up took the skirt of sauls robe in his hand cutting off the end of it without his knowledge
 and later david was full of regret for cutting off sauls skirt
 and david said to his men before the lord never let it be said that my hand was lifted up against my lord the man of the lords selection for the lords holy oil has been put on him
 so with these words david kept his servants back and did not let them make an attack on saul and saul got up and went on his way
 and after that david came out of the hollow rock and crying after saul said my lord the king and when saul gave a look back david went down on his face and gave him honour
 and david said to saul why do you give any attention to those who say that it is my desire to do you wrong
 look  you have seen today how the lord gave you up into my hands even now in the hollow of the rocks and some would have had me put you to death but i had pity on you for i said never will my hand be lifted up against my lord who has been marked with the holy oil
 and see my father see the skirt of your robe in my hand for the fact that i took off the skirt of your robe and did not put you to death is witness that i have no evil purpose and i have done you no wrong though you are waiting for my life to take it
 may the lord be judge between me and you and may the lord give me my rights against you but my hand will never be lifted up against you
 there is an old saying from the evil doer comes evil but my hand will never be lifted up against you
 after whom has the king of israel come out for whom are you searching for a dead dog an insect
 so let the lord be judge and give a decision between me and you and see and give support to my cause and keep me from falling into your hands
 now when david had said these words to saul saul said is this your voice david my son and saul was overcome with weeping
 and he said to david you are right and i am wrong for you have given me back good but i have given you evil
 and you have made clear to me how good you have been to me today because when the lord gave me up into your hands you did not put me to death
 if a man comes across his hater will he let him get away safe so may you be rewarded by the lord for what you have done for me today
 and now i am certain that you will be king and that the kingdom of israel will be made strong under your authority
 so give me your oath by the lord that you will not put an end to my seed after me or let my name be cut off from my fathers family
 and david gave saul his oath and saul went back to his house but david and his men went up to their safe place
 and death came to samuel and all israel came together weeping for him and put his body in its resting place in his house at ramah then david went down to the waste land of maon
 now there was a man in maon whose business was in carmel he was a great man and had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was cutting the wool of his sheep in carmel
 now this man was named nabal and his wifes name was abigail she was a woman of good sense and pleasing looks but the man was cruel and evil in his ways he was of the family of caleb
 and david had word in the waste land that nabal was cutting the wool of his sheep
 and david sent ten young men and said to them go up to carmel and go to nabal and say kind words to him in my name
 and say this to my brother may all be well for you peace be to you and your house and all you have
 i have had word that you have wool cutters now the keepers of your sheep have been with us and we have done them no evil and taken nothing of theirs while they were in carmel
 if your young men are questioned they will say the same thing so now let my young men have grace in your eyes for we are come at a good time please give anything you may have by you to your servants and to your son david
 and when davids young men came they said all this to nabal in davids name and said nothing more
 and nabal gave them his answer and said who is david who is the son of jesse there are a number of servants in these days running away from their masters
 am i to take my bread and my wine and the meat i have got ready for my wool cutters and give it to men coming from i have no idea where
 so davids young men turning away went back and gave him an account of everything he had said
 and david said to his men put on your swords every one of you and every man put on his sword and david did the same and about four hundred men went up with david and two hundred kept watch over their goods
 but one of the young men said to nabals wife abigail david sent men from the waste land to say kind words to our master and he gave them a rough answer
 but these men have been very good to us they did us no wrong and nothing of ours was touched while we were with them in the fields
 but day and night they were like a wall round us while we were with them looking after the sheep
 so now give thought to what you are going to do for evil is in store for our master and all his house for he is such a good for nothing person that it is not possible to say anything to him
 then abigail quickly took two hundred cakes of bread and two skins full of wine and five sheep ready for cooking and five measures of dry grain and a hundred parcels of dry grapes and two hundred cakes of figs and put them on asses
 and she said to her young men go on in front of me and i will come after you but she said nothing to her husband nabal
 now while she was going down under cover of the mountain on her ass david and his men came down against her and suddenly she came face to face with them
 now david had said what was the use of my taking care of this mans goods in the waste land so that there was no loss of anything which was his he has only given me back evil for good
 may gods punishment be on david if when morning comes there is so much as one male of his people still living
 and when abigail saw david she quickly got off her ass falling down on her face before him
 and falling at his feet she said may the wrong be on me my lord on me let your servant say a word to you and give ear to the words of your servant
 let my lord give no attention to nabal that good for nothing for as his name is so is he a man without sense but i your servant did not see the young men whom my lord sent
 so now my lord by the living god and by your living soul seeing that the lord has kept you from the crime of blood and from taking into your hands the punishment for your wrongs may all your haters and those who would do evil to my lord be like nabal
 and let this offering which your servant gives to my lord be given to the young men who are with my lord
 and may the sin of your servant have forgiveness for the lord will certainly make your family strong because my lord is fighting in the lords war and no evil will be seen in you all your days
 and though a man has taken up arms against you putting your life in danger still the soul of my lord will be kept safe among the band of the living with the lord your god and the souls of those who are against you he will send violently away from him like stones from a bag
 and when the lord has done for my lord all those good things which he has said he will do for you and has made you a ruler over israel
 then you will have no cause for grief and my lords heart will not be troubled because you have taken life without cause and have yourself given punishment for your wrongs and when the lord has been good to you then give a thought to your servant
 and david said to abigail may the lord the god of israel be praised who sent you to me today
 a blessing on your good sense and on you who have kept me today from the crime of blood and from taking into my hands the punishment for my wrongs
 for truly by the living lord the god of israel who has kept me from doing you evil if you had not been so quick in coming to me and meeting me by dawn there would not have been in nabals house so much as one male living
 then david took from her hands her offering and he said to her go back to your house in peace see i have given ear to your voice and taken your offering with respect
 and abigail went back to nabal and he was feasting in his house like a king and nabals heart was full of joy for he had taken much wine so she said nothing to him till dawn came
 and in the morning when the effect of the wine was gone nabals wife gave him an account of all these things and all the heart went out of him and he became like stone
 and about ten days after the lord sent disease on nabal and death came to him
 and david hearing that nabal was dead said may the lord be praised who has taken up my cause against nabal for the shame which he put on me and has kept back his servant from evil and has sent on nabals head the reward of his evil doing and david sent word to abigail desiring to take her as his wife
 and when davids servants came to carmel to abigail they said to her david has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife
 and she got up and going down on her face to the earth said see i am ready to be a servant girl washing the feet of the servants of my lord
 then abigail got up quickly and went on her ass with five of her young women after the men whom david had sent and she became davids wife
 and david had taken ahinoam of jezreel to be his wife these two were his wives
 now saul had given his daughter michal davids wife to palti the son of laish of gallim
 and the ziphites came to saul at gibeah and said is not david waiting secretly near us in the hill of hachilah before the waste land
 then saul went down to the waste land of ziph taking with him three thousand of the best men of israel to make search for david in the waste land of ziph
 and saul put up his tents on the hill of hachilah which is in front of the waste land on the road but david was in the waste land and he saw that saul was coming after him
 and so david sent out watchers and got word from them that saul was certainly coming
 and david got up and came to the place where sauls tents were and david had a view of the place where saul was sleeping with abner the son of ner the captain of his army and saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts and the tents of the people were all round him
 then david said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother of joab who will go down with me to the tents of saul and abishai said i will go down with you
 so david and abishai came down to the army by night and saul was sleeping inside the ring of carts with his spear planted in the earth by his head and abner and the people were sleeping round him
 then abishai said to david god has given up your hater into your hands today now let me give him one blow through to the earth with his spear and there will be no need to give him a second
 and david said to abishai do not put him to death for who without sin may put out his hand against the man on whom the lord has put the holy oil
 and david said by the living lord the lord will send destruction on him the natural day of his death will come or he will go into the fight and come to his end
 never will my hand be stretched out against the man marked with the holy oil but take the spear which is by his head and the vessel of water and let us go
 so david took the spear and the vessel of water from sauls head and they got away without any man seeing them or being conscious of their coming or awaking for they were all sleeping because a deep sleep from the lord had come on them
 then david went over to the other side and took his place on the top of a mountain some distance away with a great space between them
 and crying out to the people and to abner the son of ner david said have you no answer to give abner then abner said who is that crying out to the king
 and david said to abner are you not a man of war is there any other like you in israel why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king for one of the people came in to put the king your lord to death
 what you have done is not good by the living lord death is the right fate for you because you have not kept watch over your lord the man on whom the lord has put the holy oil now see where is the kings spear and the vessel of water which was by his head
 and saul conscious that the voice was davids said is that your voice david my son and david said it is my voice o my lord king
 and he said why does my lord go armed against his servant what have i done or what evil is there in me
 let my lord the king give ear now to the words of his servant if it is the lord who is moving you against me let him take an offering but if it is the children of men may they be cursed before the lord for driving me out today and keeping me from my place in the heritage of the lord saying go be the servant of other gods
 then do not let my blood be drained out on the earth away from the face of the lord for the king of israel has come out to take my life like one going after birds in the mountains
 then saul said i have done wrong come back to me david my son i will do you no more wrong because my life was dear to you today truly i have been foolish and my error is very great
 then david said here is the kings spear  let one of the young men come over and get it
 and the lord will give to every man the reward of his righteousness and his faith because the lord gave you into my hands today and i would not put out my hand against the man who has been marked with the holy oil
 and so as your life was dear to me today may my life be dear to the lord and may he make me free from all my troubles
 then saul said to david may a blessing be on you david my son you will do great things and without doubt you will overcome then david went on his way and saul went back to his place
 and david said to himself some day death will come to me by the hand of saul the only thing for me to do is to get away into the land of the philistines then saul will give up hope of taking me in any part of the land of israel and so i may be able to get away from him
 so david and the six hundred men who were with him went over to achish the son of maoch king of gath
 and david and his men were living with achish at gath every man had his family with him and david had his two wives ahinoam of jezreel and abigail of carmel who had been the wife of nabal
 and saul hearing that david had gone to gath went after him no longer
 then david said to achish if now i have grace in your eyes let me have a place in one of the smaller towns of your land to be my living place for it is not right for your servant to be living with you in the kings town
 so achish straight away gave him ziklag and for that reason ziklag has been the property of the kings of judah to this day
 and david was living in the land of the philistines for the space of a year and four months
 and david and his men went up and made attacks on the geshurites and the girzites and the amalekites for these were the people who were living in the land from telam on the way to shur as far as egypt
 and david again and again made attacks on the land till not a man or a woman was still living and he took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the clothing and he came back to achish
 and every time achish said where have you been fighting today david said against the south of judah and the south of the jerahmeelites and the south of the kenites
 not one living man or woman did david ever take back with him to gath fearing that they might give an account of what had taken place and say this is what david did and so has he been doing all the time while he has been living in the land of the philistines
 and achish had belief in what david said saying he has made himself hated by all his people israel and so he will be my servant for ever
 now in those days the philistines got their forces together to make war on israel and achish said to david certainly you and your men are to go out with me to the fight
 and david said to achish you will see now what your servant will do and achish said to david then i will make you keeper of my head for ever
 now samuel was dead and all israel after weeping for him had put his body in its last resting place in ramah his town and saul had put away from the land all those who had control of spirits and who made use of secret arts
 and the philistines came together and put their forces in position in shunem and saul got all israel together and they took up their positions in gilboa
 and when saul saw the philistine army he was troubled and his heart was moved with fear
 and when saul went for directions to the lord the lord gave him no answer by a dream or by the urim or by the prophets
 then saul said to his servants get me a woman who has control of a spirit so that i may go to her and get directions and his servants said to him there is such a woman at en dor
 so saul putting on other clothing so that he might not be seen to be the king took two men with him and went to the woman by night and he said now with the help of the spirit which you have make the person whose name i will give you come up
 and the woman said to him but you have knowledge of what saul has done how he has put away out of the land those who have control of spirits and the users of secret arts why would you by a trick put me in danger of death
 and saul made an oath to her by the lord saying by the living lord no punishment will come to you for this
 then the woman said who am i to let you see and he said make samuel come up for me
 and the woman saw that it was saul and she gave a loud cry and said to saul why have you made use of deceit for you are saul
 and the king said to her have no fear what do you see and the woman said to saul i see a god coming up out of the earth
 and he said to her what is his form and she said it is an old man coming up covered with a robe and saul saw that it was samuel and with his face bent down to the earth he gave him honour
 and samuel said to saul why have you made me come up troubling my rest and saul in answer said i am in great danger for the philistines are making war on me and god has gone away from me and will no longer give me any answer by the prophets or by dreams so i have sent for you to make clear to me what i am to do
 and samuel said why do you put your questions to me seeing that god has gone away from you and is on the side of him who is against you
 and the lord himself has done what i said the lord has taken the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbour david
 because you did not do what the lord said and did not give effect to his burning wrath against amalek so the lord has done this thing to you today
 and more than this the lord will give israel up with you into the hands of the philistines and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me and the lord will give up the army of israel into the hands of the philistines
 then saul went down flat on the earth and was full of fear because of samuels words and there was no strength in him for he had taken no food all that day or all that night
 and the woman came to saul and saw that he was in great trouble and said to him see now your servant has given ear to your words and i have put my life in danger by doing what you said
 so now give ear to the voice of your servant and let me give you a little bread and take some food to give you strength when you go on your way
 but he would not saying i have no desire for food but his servants together with the woman made him take food and he gave way to them so he got up from the earth and took his seat on the bed
 and the woman had in the house a young cow made fat for food and she put it to death straight away and she took meal and got it mixed and made unleavened bread
 and she put it before saul and his servants and they had a meal then they got up and went away the same night
 now the philistines got all their army together at aphek and the israelites put their forces in position by the fountain in jezreel
 and the lords of the philistines went on with their hundreds and their thousands and david and his men came after with achish
 then the rulers of the philistines said what are these hebrews doing here and achish said to the rulers of the philistines is this not david the servant of saul the king of israel who has been with me for a year or two and i have never seen any wrong in him from the time when he came to me till now
 but the rulers of the philistines were angry with him and said to him make the man go back to the place you have given him do not let him go down with us to the fight or he may be turned against us and be false to us for how will this man make peace with his lord will it not be with the heads of these men
 is this not david who was named in their songs when in the dance they said to one another saul has put to death thousands and david tens of thousands
 then achish sent for david and said to him by the living lord you are upright and everything you have done with me in the army has been pleasing to me i have seen no evil in you from the day when you came to me till now but still the lords are not pleased with you
 so now go back and go in peace so that you do not make the lords of the philistines angry
 and david said to achish but what have i done what have you seen in your servant while i have been with you till this day that i may not go and take up arms against those who are now making war on my lord the king
 and achish in answer said it is true that in my eyes you are good like an angel of god but still the rulers of the philistines have said he is not to go up with us to the fight
 so get up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who are with you and go to the place i have given you and have no evil design in your heart for you are good in my eyes but when there is light enough in the morning go away
 so david and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel
 now the young samuel was the servant of the lord before eli in those days the lord kept his word secret from men there was no open vision
 and at that time when eli was resting in his place  now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see 
 and the light of god was still burning while samuel was sleeping in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was
 the voice of the lord said samuels name and he said here am i
 and running to eli he said here am i for you said my name and eli said i did not say your name go to your rest again so he went back to his bed
 and again the lord said samuel and samuel got up and went to eli and said here am i for you certainly said my name but he said in answer i said nothing my son go to your rest again
 now at that time samuel had no knowledge of the lord and the revelation of the word of the lord had not come to him
 and for the third time the lord said samuels name and he got up and went to eli and said here am i for you certainly said my name then it was clear to eli that the voice which had said the childs name was the lords
 so eli said to samuel go back and if the voice comes again let your answer be say on lord for the ears of your servant are open so samuel went back to his bed
 then the lord came and said as before samuel samuel then samuel made answer say on lord for the ears of your servant are open
 and the lord said to samuel see i will do a thing in israel at which the ears of everyone hearing of it will be burning
 in that day i will do to eli everything which i have said about his family from first to last
 and you are to say to him that i will send punishment on his family for ever for the sin which he had knowledge of because his sons have been cursing god and he had no control over them
 so i have made an oath to the family of eli that no offering of meat or of meal which they may make will ever take away the sin of his family
 and samuel kept where he was not moving till the time came for opening the doors of the house of god in the morning and fear kept him from giving eli an account of his vision
 then eli said samuel my son and samuel answering said here am i
 and he said what did the lord say to you do not keep it from me may gods punishment be on you if you keep from me anything he said to you
 then samuel gave him an account of everything keeping nothing back and he said it is the lord let him do what seems good to him
 and samuel became older and the lord was with him and let not one of his words be without effect
 and it was clear to all israel from dan to beer sheba that samuel had been made a prophet of the lord
 and the lord was seen again in shiloh for the lord gave to samuel in shiloh the revelation of his word
 now when david and his men came to ziklag on the third day the amalekites had made an attack on the south and on ziklag and had overcome ziklag and put it on fire
 and had made the women and all who were there small and great prisoners they had not put any of them to death but had taken them all away
 and when david and his men came to the town they saw that it had been burned down and their wives and their sons and daughters had been made prisoners
 then david and the people who were with him gave themselves up to weeping till they were able to go on weeping no longer
 and davids two wives ahinoam of jezreel and abigail the wife of nabal of carmel had been made prisoners
 and david was greatly troubled for the people were talking of stoning him because their hearts were bitter every man sorrowing for his sons and his daughters but david made himself strong in the lord his god
 and david said to abiathar the priest the son of ahimelech come here to me with the ephod and abiathar took the ephod to david
 then david questioning the lord said am i to go after this band will i be able to overtake them and in answer he said go after them for you will certainly overtake them and get back everything
 so david went and his six hundred men went with him and they came to the stream besor
 and david with four hundred men went on but two hundred of them were overcome with weariness and not able to go across the stream
 and in the fields they saw an egyptian whom they took to david and they gave him bread and he had a meal and they gave him water for drink
 and they gave him part of a cake of figs and some dry grapes and after the food his spirit came back to him for he had had no food or drink for three days and nights
 and david said to him whose man are you and where do you come from and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master went on without me because three days back i became ill
 we made an attack on the south part of the country of the cherethites and on the land which is judahs and on the south of caleb and we put ziklag on fire
 and david said to him will you take me down to this band and he said if you give me your oath that you will not put me to death or give me up to my master i will take you to them
 and when he had taken him down they saw them all seated about on all sides feasting and drinking among all the mass of goods which they had taken from the land of the philistines and the land of judah
 and david went on fighting them from evening till the evening of the day after and not one of them got away but only four hundred young men who went in flight on camels
 and david got back everything the amalekites had taken and he got back his two wives
 there was no loss of anything small or great sons or daughters or goods or anything which they had taken away david got it all back
 and they took all the flocks and herds and driving them in front of him said these are davids
 and david came to the two hundred men who because of weariness had not gone with him but were waiting at the stream besor and they went out meeting david and the people who were with him and when they came near them they said how are you
 then the bad and good for nothing men among those who went with david said because they did not go with us we will give them nothing of the goods which we have got back but only to every man his wife and children so that he may take them and go
 then david said you are not to do this my brothers after what the lord has given us who has kept us safe and given up the band which came against us into our hands
 who is going to give any attention to you in this question for an equal part will be given to him who went to the fight and to him who was waiting by the goods they are all to have the same
 and so he made it a rule and an order for israel from that day till now
 and when david came to ziklag he sent some of the goods to the responsible men of judah and to his friends saying here is an offering for you from the goods of those who were fighting against the lord
 he sent to those who were in beth el and in ramah of the south and in jattir
 and to those in arara and eshtemoa
 and carmel and in the towns of the jerahmeelites and in the towns of the kenites
 and to those who were in hormah and in bor ashan and in athach
 and in hebron and to all the places where david and his men had been living
 now the philistines were fighting against israel and the men of israel went in flight before the philistines falling down wounded in mount gilboa
 and the philistines overtook saul and his sons and they put to death jonathan and abinadab and malchi shua the sons of saul
 and the fight was going badly for saul and the archers came across him and he was wounded by the archers
 then saul said to the servant who had the care of his arms take out your sword and put it through me before these men without circumcision come and make sport of me but his servant full of fear would not do so then saul took out his sword and falling on it put an end to himself
 and when his servant saw that saul was dead he did the same and was united with him in death
 so death overtook saul and his three sons and his servant on the same day
 and when the men of israel across the valley and on the other side of jordan saw that the army of israel was in flight and that saul and his sons were dead they came out of their towns and went in flight and the philistines came and took them for themselves
 now on the day after when the philistines came to take their goods from the dead they saw saul and his three sons dead on the earth in mount gilboa
 and cutting off his head and taking away his war dress they sent word into the land of the philistines round about to take the news to their gods and to the people
 his war dress they put in the house of astarte and his body was fixed on the wall of beth shan
 and when the people of jabesh gilead had news of what the philistines had done to saul
 all the fighting men got up and travelling all night took sauls body and the bodies of his sons from the wall of beth shan and they came to jabesh and had them burned there
 and their bones they put in the earth under a tree in jabesh and for seven days they took no food
 now at that time the philistines came together to make war against israel and the men of israel went out to war against the philistines and took up their position at the side of eben ezer and the philistines put their forces in position in aphek
 and the philistines put their forces in order against israel and the fighting was hard and israel was overcome by the philistines who put to the sword about four thousand of their army in the field
 and when the people came back to their tents the responsible men of israel said why has the lord let the philistines overcome us today let us get the ark of the lords agreement here from shiloh so that it may be with us and give us salvation from the hands of those who are against us
 so the people sent to shiloh and got the ark of the agreement of the lord of armies whose resting place is between the winged ones and hophni and phinehas the two sons of eli were there with the ark of gods agreement
 and when the ark of the lords agreement came into the tent circle all israel gave a great cry so that the earth was sounding with it
 and the philistines hearing the noise of their cry said what is this great cry among the tents of the hebrews then it became clear to them that the ark of the lord had come to the tent circle
 and the philistines full of fear said god has come into their tents and they said trouble is ours  for never before has such a thing been seen
 trouble is ours  who will give us salvation from the hands of these great gods these are the gods who sent all sorts of blows on the egyptians in the waste land
 be strong o philistines be men  do not be servants to the hebrews as they have been to you go forward to the fight without fear
 so the philistines went to the fight and israel was overcome and every man went in flight to his tent and great was the destruction for thirty thousand footmen of israel were put to the sword
 and the ark of god was taken and hophni and phinehas the sons of eli were put to the sword
 and a man of benjamin went running from the fight and came to shiloh the same day with his clothing out of order and earth on his head
 and when he came eli was seated by the wayside watching and in his heart was fear for the ark of god and when the man came into the town and gave the news there was a great outcry
 and eli hearing the noise and the cries said what is the reason of this outcry and the man came quickly and gave the news to eli
 now eli was ninety eight years old and his eyes were fixed so that he was not able to see
 and the man said to eli i have come from the army and have come in flight today from the fight and he said how did it go my son
 and the man said israel went in flight from the philistines and there has been great destruction among the people and your two sons hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god has been taken
 and at these words about the ark of god eli falling back off his seat by the side of the doorway into the town came down on the earth so that his neck was broken and death overtook him for he was an old man and of great weight he had been judging israel for forty years
 and his daughter in law the wife of phinehas was with child and near the time when she would give birth and when she had the news that the ark of god had been taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead her pains came on her suddenly and she gave birth
 and when she was very near death the women who were with her said have no fear for you have given birth to a son but she made no answer and gave no attention to it
 and she gave the child the name of ichabod saying the glory has gone from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her father in law and her husband
 and she said the glory is gone from israel for the ark of god has been taken
 now the philistines having taken the ark of god took it with them from eben ezer to ashdod
 they took the ark of god into the house of dagon and put it by the side of dagon
 and when the people of ashdod got up early on the morning after they saw that dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the lord and they took dagon up and put him in his place again
 and when they got up early on the morning after dagon had come down to the earth on his face before the ark of the lord and his head and his hands were broken off on the doorstep only the base was in its place
 so to this day no priest of dagon or any who come into dagons house will put his foot on the doorstep of the house of dagon in ashdod
 but the hand of the lord was hard on the people of ashdod and he sent disease on them through all the country of ashdod
 and when the men of ashdod saw how it was they said let not the ark of the god of israel be with us for his hand is hard on us and on dagon our god
 so they sent for all the lords of the philistines to come together there and said what are we to do with the ark of the god of israel and their answer was let the ark of the god of israel be taken away to gath so they took the ark of the god of israel away
 but after they had taken it away the hand of the lord was stretched out against the town for its destruction and the signs of disease came out on all the men of the town small and great
 so they sent the ark of god to ekron and when the ark of god came to ekron the people of the town made an outcry saying they have sent the ark of the god of israel to us for the destruction of us and of our people
 so they sent and got together all the lords of the philistines and they said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go back to its place so that it may not be the cause of death to us and to our people for there was a great fear of death through all the town the hand of god was very hard on them there
 and those men who were not overtaken by death were cruelly diseased and the cry of the town went up to heaven
 now the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines for seven months
 and the philistines sent for the priests and those who were wise in secret arts and said to them what are we to do with the ark of the lord how are we to send it away to its place
 and they said if you send away the ark of the god of israel do not send it without an offering but send him a sin offering with it then you will have peace again and it will be clear to you why the weight of his hand has not been lifted from you
 then they said what sin offering are we to send to him and they said five gold images of the growths caused by your disease and five gold mice one for every lord of the philistines for the same disease came on you and on your lords
 so make images of the growths caused by your disease and of the mice which are damaging your land and give glory to the god of israel it may be that the weight of his hand will be lifted from you and from your gods and from your land
 why do you make your hearts hard like the hearts of pharaoh and the egyptians when he had made sport of them did they not let the people go and they went away
 so now take and make ready a new cart and two cows which have never come under the yoke and have the cows yoked to the cart and take their young ones away from them
 and put the ark of the lord on the cart and the gold images which you are sending as a sin offering in a chest by its side and send it away so that it may go
 if it goes by the land of israel to beth shemesh then this great evil is his work but if not then we may be certain that the evil was not his doing but was the working of chance
 and the men did so they took two cows yoking them to the cart and shutting up their young ones in their living place
 and they put the ark of the lord on the cart and the chest with the gold images
 and the cows took the straight way by the road to beth shemesh they went by the highway not turning to the right or to the left and the sound of their voices was clear on the road and the lords of the philistines went after them as far as the edge of beth shemesh
 and the people of beth shemesh were cutting their grain in the valley and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark and were full of joy when they saw it
 and the cart came into the field of joshua the beth shemite and came to a stop there by a great stone and cutting up the wood of the cart they made a burned offering of the cows to the lord
 then the levites took down the ark of the lord and the chest in which were the gold images and put them on the great stone and the men of beth shemesh made burned offerings and gave worship that day before the lord
 and the five lords of the philistines having seen it went back to ekron the same day
 now these are the gold images which the philistines sent as a sin offering to the lord one for ashdod one for gaza one for ashkelon one for gath one for ekron
 and the gold mice one for every town of the philistines the property of the five lords walled towns as well as country places and the great stone where they put the ark of the lord is still in the field of joshua the beth shemite to this day
 but the lord sent destruction on seventy men of the people of beth shemesh for looking into the ark of the lord and great was the sorrow of the people for the destruction which the lord had sent on them
 and the men of beth shemesh said who is able to keep his place before the lord this holy god and to whom may he go from us
 and they sent men to the people living in kiriath jearim saying the philistines have sent back the ark of the lord come and take it up to your country
 so the men of kiriath jearim came and took the ark of the lord to the house of abinadab in gibeah and they made his son eleazar holy and put the ark in his care
 and the ark was in kiriath jearim for a long time as much as twenty years and all israel was searching after the lord with weeping
 then samuel said to all israel if with all your hearts you would come back to the lord then put away all the strange gods and the astartes from among you and let your hearts be turned to the lord and be servants to him only and he will make you safe from the hands of the philistines
 so the children of israel gave up the worship of baal and astarte and became worshippers of the lord only
 then samuel said let all israel come to mizpah and i will make prayer to the lord for you
 so they came together to mizpah and got water draining it out before the lord and they took no food that day and they said we have done evil against the lord and samuel was judge of the children of israel in mizpah
 now when the philistines had news that the children of israel had come together at mizpah the lords of the philistines went up against israel and the children of israel hearing of it were full of fear
 and the children of israel said to samuel go on crying to the lord our god for us to make us safe from the hands of the philistines
 and samuel took a young lamb offering all of it as a burned offering to the lord and samuel made prayers to the lord for israel and the lord gave him an answer
 and while samuel was offering the burned offering the philistines came near for the attack on israel but at the thunder of the lords voice that day the philistines were overcome with fear and they gave way before israel
 and the men of israel went out from mizpah and went after the philistines attacking them till they came under beth car
 then samuel took a stone and put it up between mizpah and jeshanah naming it eben ezer and saying up to now the lord has been our help
 so the philistines were overcome and did not come into the country of israel again and all the days of samuel the hand of the lord was against the philistines
 and the towns which the philistines had taken were given back to israel from ekron to gath and all the country round them israel made free from the power of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites
 and samuel was judge of israel all the days of his life
 from year to year he went in turn to beth el and gilgal and mizpah judging israel in all those places
 and his base was at ramah where his house was there he was judge of israel and there he made an altar to the lord
 now when samuel was old he made his sons judges over israel
 the name of his first son was joel and the name of his second abijah they were judges in beer sheba
 and his sons did not go in his ways but moved by the love of money took rewards and were not upright in judging
 then all the responsible men of israel got together and went to samuel at ramah
 and said to him see now you are old and your sons do not go in your ways give us a king now to be our judge so that we may be like the other nations
 but samuel was not pleased when they said to him give us a king to be our judge and samuel made prayer to the lord
 and the lord said to samuel give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you they have not been turned away from you but they have been turned away from me not desiring me to be king over them
 as they have done from the first from the day when i took them out of egypt till this day turning away from me and worshipping other gods so now they are acting in the same way to you
 give ear now to their voice but make a serious protest to them and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler
 and samuel said all these words of the lord to the people who were desiring a king
 and he said this is the sort of king who will be your ruler he will take your sons and make them his servants his horsemen and drivers of his war carriages and they will go running before his war carriages
 and he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war carriages
 your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread makers
 he will take your fields and your vine gardens and your olive gardens all the best of them and give them to his servants
 he will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants
 he will take your men servants and your servant girls and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work
 he will take a tenth of your sheep and you will be his servants
 then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves but the lord will not give you an answer in that day
 but the people gave no attention to the voice of samuel and they said no but we will have a king over us
 so that we may be like the other nations and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war
 then samuel after hearing all the people had to say went and gave an account of it to the lord
 and the lord said to samuel give ear to their voice and make a king for them then samuel said to the men of israel let every man go back to his town
 now there was a man of benjamin named kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of becorath the son of aphiah a benjamite a man of wealth
 he had a son named saul a specially good looking young man there was no one better looking among the children of israel he was taller by a head than any other of the people
 now the asses of sauls father kish had gone wandering away and kish said to his son saul take one of the servants with you and get up and go in search of the asses
 so they went through the hill country of ephraim and through the land of shalishah but they saw no sign of them then they went through the land of shaalim but they were not there and they went through the land of the benjamites but they did not come across them
 and when they had come to the land of zuph saul said to the servant who was with him come let us go back or my father may give up caring about the asses and be troubled about us
 but the servant said to him see now in this town there is a man of god who is highly honoured and everything he says comes true let us go there now it may be that he will give us directions about our journey
 then saul said to his servant but if we go what are we to take the man all our bread is gone and we have no offering to take to the man of god what are we to do
 but the servant said in answer i have here a fourth part of a shekel of silver i will give that to the man of god and he will give us directions about our way
  in the past in israel when a man went to get directions from god he said come let us go to the seer for he who now is named prophet was in those days given the name of seer 
 then saul said to his servant you have said well come let us go so they went to the town where the man of god was
 and when they were on the way up to the town they saw some young girls going out to get water and said to them is the seer here
 and they said he is in fact he is before you go quickly now for he has come into the town today for the people are making an offering in the high place today
 when you come into the town you will see him straight away before he goes up to the high place for the feast the people are waiting for his blessing before starting the feast and after that the guests will take part in it so go up now and you will see him
 so they went up to the town and when they came inside the town samuel came face to face with them on his way to the high place
 now the day before saul came the word of god had come to samuel saying
 tomorrow about this time i will send you a man from the land of benjamin and on him you are to put the holy oil making him ruler over my people israel and he will make my people safe from the hands of the philistines for i have seen the sorrow of my people whose cry has come up to me
 and when samuel saw saul the lord said to him this is the man of whom i gave you word  he it is who is to have authority over my people
 then saul came up to samuel in the doorway of the town and said give me directions if you will be so good to the house of the seer
 then samuel said to saul i am the seer go up before me to the high place and take food with me today and in the morning i will let you go after opening to you all the secrets of your heart
 as for your asses which have been wandering for three days give no thought to them for they have come back and for whom are all the desired things in israel are they not for you and your fathers family
 and saul said am i not a man of benjamin the smallest of all the tribes of israel and my family the least of the families of benjamin why then do you say these words to me
 then samuel took saul and his servant into the guest room and made them take the chief place among all the guests who were there about thirty persons
 and samuel said to the cook give me that part which i gave you orders to keep by you
 and the cook took up the leg with the fat tail on it and put it before saul and samuel said this is the part which has been kept for you take it as your part of the feast because it has been kept for you till the right time came and till the guests were present so that day saul took food with samuel
 and when they had come down from the high place into the town where a bed was made ready for saul he went to rest
 and about dawn samuel said to saul on the roof get up so that i may send you away so saul got up and he and samuel went out together
 and on their way down to the end of the town samuel said to saul give your servant orders to go on in front of us  so he went on  but you keep here so that i may give you the word of god
 and solomon the son of david made himself strong in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and made him very great
 and solomon sent word to all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every chief in all israel heads of their families
 then solomon and all the men of israel with him went to the high place at gibeon because the tent of meeting of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in the waste land was there
 but the ark of god had been moved by david from kiriath jearim to the place which he had made ready for it for he had put up a tent for it at jerusalem
 and the altar of brass which bezalel the son of uri the son of hur had made was there before the tent of the lord and solomon and all the people went to give worship there
 and solomon went up there to the brass altar before the lord at the tent of meeting offering on it a thousand burned offerings
 in that night god came to solomon in a vision and said to him say what i am to give you
 and solomon said to god great was your mercy to david my father and you have made me king in his place
 now o lord god let your word to david my father come true for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in number
 give me now wisdom and knowledge so that i may go out and come in before this people for who is able to be the judge of this great people of yours
 and god said to solomon because this was in your heart and you did not make request for money property or honour or for the destruction of your haters or for long life but you have made request for wisdom and knowledge for yourself so that you may be the judge of my people over whom i have made you king
 wisdom and knowledge are given to you and i will give you wealth and honour such as no king has had before you or ever will have after you
 so solomon went back from the high place at gibeon from before the tent of meeting to jerusalem and he was king over israel
 and solomon got together war carriages and horsemen he had one thousand four hundred carriages and twelve thousand horsemen which he kept some in the carriage towns and some with the king at jerusalem
 and the king made silver and gold as common as stones in jerusalem and cedar like the sycamore trees of the lowland in number
 and solomons horses came out of egypt the kings traders got them from kue at a price
 a war carriage might be got from egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they got them at the same rate for all the kings of the hittites and the kings of aram
 and rehoboam went to shechem where all israel had come together to make him king
 and when jeroboam the son of nebat had news of it  for he was in egypt where he had gone in flight from king solomon  he came back from egypt
 and they sent for him and jeroboam and all israel came to rehoboam and said
 your father put a hard yoke on us if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard then we will be your servants
 and he said to them come to me again after three days so the people went away
 then king rehoboam took the opinion of the old men who had been with solomon his father when he was living and said in your opinion what answer am i to give to this people
 and they said to him if you are kind to this people pleasing them and saying good words to them then they will be your servants for ever
 but he gave no attention to the opinion of the old men but went to the young men of his generation who were waiting before him
 and he said to them what is your opinion what answer are we to give to this people who have said to me make less the weight of the yoke which your father put on us
 and the young men of his generation said to him this is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying your father put a hard yoke on us but will you make it less say to them my little finger is thicker than my fathers body
 if my father put a hard yoke on you i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give you blows with snakes
 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king had given orders saying come to me again on the third day
 and the king gave them a rough answer so king rehoboam gave no attention to the suggestion of the old men
 but gave them the answer put forward by the young men saying my father made your yoke hard but i will make it harder my father gave you punishment with whips but i will give it with snakes
 so the king did not give ear to the people for this came about by the purpose of god so that the lord might give effect to his word which he had said by ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat
 and when all israel saw that the king would give no attention to them the people in answer said to the king what part have we in david what is our heritage in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel now see to your house david so all israel went to their tents
 but rehoboam was still king over those of the children of israel who were living in the towns of judah
 then rehoboam sent adoniram the overseer of the forced work and he was stoned to death by all israel and king rehoboam went quickly and got into his carriage to go in flight to jerusalem
 so israel was turned away from the family of david to this day
 and rehoboam came to jerusalem and got together the men of judah and benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand of his best fighting men to make war against israel and get the kingdom back for rehoboam
 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying
 say to rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin
 the lord has said you are not to go to war against your brothers let every man go back to his house for this thing is my purpose so they gave ear to the words of the lord and were turned back from fighting against jeroboam
 now rehoboam kept in jerusalem building walled towns in judah
 he was the builder of beth lehem and etam and tekoa
 and beth zur and soco and adullam
 and gath and mareshah and ziph
 and adoraim and lachish and azekah
 and zorah and aijalon and hebron walled towns in judah and benjamin
 and he made the walled towns strong and he put captains in them and stores of food oil and wine
 and in every town he put stores of body covers and spears and made them very strong and judah and benjamin were his
 and the priests and levites who were in all israel came together to him from every part of their country
 for the levites gave up their living places and their property and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had sent them away not letting them be priests to the lord
 and he himself made priests for the high places and for the images of he goats and oxen which he had made
 and after them from all the tribes of israel all those whose hearts were fixed and true to the lord the god of israel came to jerusalem to make offerings to the lord the god of their fathers
 so they went on increasing the power of the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong for three years and for three years they went in the ways of david and solomon
 and rehoboam took as his wife mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david and of abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse
 and she had sons by him jeush shemariah and zaham
 and after her he took maacah the daughter of absalom and she had abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith by him
 maacah the daughter of absalom was dearer to rehoboam than all his wives and his servant wives  for he had eighteen wives and sixty servant wives and was the father of twenty eight sons and sixty daughters 
 rehoboam made abijah the son of maacah chief and ruler among his brothers for it was his purpose to make him king
 and in his wisdom he had his sons stationed in every walled town through all the lands of judah and benjamin and he gave them a great store of food and took wives for them
 now when rehoboams position as king had been made certain and he was strong he gave up the law of the lord and all israel with him
 now in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because of their sin against the lord
 with twelve hundred war carriages and sixty thousand horsemen and the people who came with him out of egypt were more than might be numbered lubim and sukkiim and ethiopians
 and he took the walled towns of judah and came as far as jerusalem
 now shemaiah the prophet came to rehoboam and the chiefs of judah who had come together in jerusalem because of shishak and said to them the lord has said because you have given me up i have given you up into the hands of shishak
 then the chiefs of israel and the king made themselves low and said the lord is upright
 and the lord seeing that they had made themselves low said to shemaiah they have made themselves low i will not send destruction on them but in a short time i will give them salvation and will not let loose my wrath on jerusalem by the hand of shishak
 but still they will become his servants so that they may see how different my yoke is from the yoke of the kingdoms of the lands
 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away all the stored wealth of the house of the lord and the kings house he took everything away and with the rest the gold body covers which solomon had made
 and in their place king rehoboam had other body covers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the kings house
 and whenever the king went into the house of the lord the armed men went with him taking the body covers and then took them back to their room
 and when he made himself low the wrath of the lord was turned back from him and complete destruction did not come on him for there was still some good in judah
 so king rehoboam made himself strong in jerusalem and was ruling there rehoboam was forty one years old when he became king and he was ruling for seventeen years in jerusalem the town which the lord had made his out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah an ammonite woman
 and he did evil because his heart was not true to the lord
 now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not recorded in the words of shemaiah the prophet and iddo the seer and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days
 and rehoboam went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david and abijah his son became king in his place
 in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam abijah became king over judah
 he was king in jerusalem for three years his mothers name was maacah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between abijah and jeroboam
 and abijah went out to the fight with an army of men of war four hundred thousand of his best men and jeroboam put his forces in line against him eight hundred thousand of his best men of war
 and abijah took up his position on mount zemaraim in the hill country of ephraim and said give ear to me o jeroboam and all israel
 is it not clear to you that the lord the god of israel gave the rule over israel to david and to his sons for ever by an agreement made with salt
 but jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david took up arms against his lord
 and certain foolish and good for nothing men were joined with him and made themselves strong against rehoboam the son of solomon when he was young and untested and not able to keep them back
 and now it is your purpose to put yourselves against the authority which the lord has put into the hands of the sons of david and you are a very great number and you have with you the gold oxen which jeroboam made to be your gods
 and after driving out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites have you not made priests for yourselves as the people of other lands do so that anyone who comes to make himself priest by offering an ox or seven sheep may be a priest of those who are no gods
 but as for us the lord is our god and we have not been turned away from him we have priests who do the work of the lord even the sons of aaron and the levites in their places
 by whom burned offerings and perfumes are sent up in smoke before the lord every morning and every evening and they put out the holy bread on its table and the gold support for the lights with its lights burning every evening for we keep the orders given to us by the lord our god but you have gone away from him
 and now god is with us at our head and his priests with their loud horns sounding against you o children of israel do not make war on the lord the god of your fathers for it will not go well for you
 but jeroboam had put some of his men to make a surprise attack on them from the back so some were facing judah and others were stationed secretly at their back
 and judah turning their faces saw that they were being attacked in front and at the back and they gave a cry for help to the lord while the priests were sounding their horns
 and the men of judah gave a loud cry and at their cry god put fear into jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah
 and the children of israel went in flight before judah and god gave them up into their hands
 and abijah and his people put them to death with great destruction five hundred thousand of the best of israel were put to the sword
 so at that time the children of israel were overcome and the children of judah got the better of them because they put their faith in the lord the god of their fathers
 and abijah went after jeroboam and took some of his towns beth el with its small towns and jeshanah with its small towns and ephron with its small towns
 and jeroboam did not get back his power again in the life time of abijah and the lord sent death on him
 but abijah became great and had fourteen wives and became the father of twenty two sons and sixteen daughters
 and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are recorded in the account of the prophet iddo
 so abijah went to rest with his fathers and they put him into the earth in the town of david and asa his son became king in his place in his time the land was quiet for ten years
 and asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god
 for he took away the altars of strange gods and the high places and had the upright stones broken and the wood pillars cut down
 and he made judah go after the lord the god of their fathers and keep his laws and his orders
 and he took away the high places and the sun images from all the towns of judah and the kingdom was quiet under his rule
 he made walled towns in judah for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years because the lord had given him rest
 he said to judah let us make these towns building walls round them with towers and doors and locks the land is still ours because we have been true to the lord our god we have been true to him and he has given us rest on every side so they went on building and all went well for them
 and asa had an army of three hundred thousand men of judah armed with body covers and spears and two hundred and eighty thousand of benjamin armed with body covers and bows all these were men of war
 and zerah the ethiopian with an army of a million and three hundred war carriages came out against them to mareshah
 and asa went out against him and they put their forces in position in the valley north of mareshah
 and asa made prayer to the lord his god and said lord you only are able to give help against the strong to him who has no strength come to our help o lord our god for our hope is in you and in your name we have come out against this great army o lord you are our god let not mans power be greater than yours
 so the lord sent fear on the ethiopians before asa and judah and the ethiopians went in flight
 and asa and the people who were with him went after them as far as gerar and so great was the destruction among the ethiopians that they were not able to get their army together again for they were broken before the lord and before his army and they took away a great amount of their goods
 and they overcame all the towns round gerar because the lord sent fear on them and they took away their goods from the towns for there were stores of wealth in them
 and they made an attack on the tents of the owners of the cattle and took away great numbers of sheep and camels and went back to jerusalem
 and the spirit of god came on azariah the son of oded
 and he came face to face with asa and said to him give ear to me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while you are with him if your hearts desire is for him he will be near you but if you give him up he will give you up
 now for a long time israel has been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without the law
 but when in their trouble they were turned to the lord the god of israel searching after him he let their search be rewarded
 in those times there was no peace for him who went out or for him who came in but great trouble was on all the people of the lands
 and they were broken by divisions nation against nation and town against town because god sent all sorts of trouble on them
 but be you strong and let not your hands be feeble for your work will be rewarded
 and asa hearing these words of azariah the son of oded the prophet took heart and put away all the disgusting things out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the towns which he had taken from the hill country of ephraim and he made new again the altar of the lord in front of the covered way of the lords house
 and he got together all judah and benjamin and those of ephraim and manasseh and simeon who were living with them for numbers of them came to him out of israel when they saw that the lord his god was with him
 so they came together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the rule of asa
 and that day they made offerings to the lord of the things they had taken in war seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
 and they made an agreement to be true to the lord the god of their fathers with all their heart and all their soul
 and that anyone small or great man or woman who was not true to the lord the god of israel would be put to death
 and they made an oath to the lord with a loud voice sounding wind instruments and horns
 and all judah was glad because of the oath for they had taken it with all their heart turning to the lord with all their desire and he was with them and gave them rest on every side
 and asa would not let maacah his mother be queen because she had made a disgusting image for asherah and asa had her image cut down and broken up and burned by the stream kidron
 but the high places were not taken away out of israel but still the heart of asa was true to the lord all his life
 he took into the house of god all the things which his father had made holy and those which he himself had made holy silver and gold and vessels
 and there was no more war till the thirty fifth year of the rule of asa
 in the thirty sixth year of the rule of asa baasha king of israel went up against judah building ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to asa king of judah
 then asa took silver and gold out of the stores of the lords house and of the kings store house and sent to ben hadad king of aram at damascus saying
 let there be an agreement between me and you as there was between my father and your father see i have sent you silver and gold go and put an end to your agreement with baasha king of israel so that he may give up attacking me
 and ben hadad did as king asa said and sent the captains of his armies against the towns of israel attacking ijon and dan and abel maim and all the store towns of naphtali
 then baasha hearing of it put a stop to the building of ramah and let his work come to an end
 then king asa with all judah took away the stones and wood with which baasha was building ramah and he made use of them for building geba and mizpah
 at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said to him because you have put your faith in the king of aram and not in the lord your god the army of the king of aram has got away out of your hands
 were not the ethiopians and the lubim a very great army with war carriages and horsemen more than might be numbered but because your faith was in the lord he gave them up into your hands
 for the eyes of the lord go this way and that through all the earth letting it be seen that he is the strong support of those whose hearts are true to him in this you have done foolishly for from now you will have wars
 then asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison burning with wrath against him because of this thing and at the same time asa was cruel to some of the people
 now the acts of asa first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of judah and israel
 in the thirty ninth year of his rule asa had a very bad disease of the feet but he did not go to the lord for help in his disease but to medical men
 so asa went to rest with his fathers and death came to him in the forty first year of his rule
 and they put him into the resting place which he had made for himself in the town of david in a bed full of sweet perfumes of all sorts of spices made by the perfumers art and they made a great burning for him
 and jehoshaphat his son became king in his place and made himself strong against israel
 he put forces in all the walled towns of judah and responsible chiefs in the land of judah and in the towns of ephraim which asa his father had taken
 and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he went in the early ways of his father not turning to the baals
 but turning to the god of his father and keeping his laws and not doing as israel did
 so the lord made his kingdom strong and all judah gave offerings to jehoshaphat and he had great wealth and honour
 his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of judah
 in the third year of his rule he sent benhail and obadiah and zechariah and nethanel and micaiah his captains as teachers into the towns of judah
 and with them shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tob adonijah the levites and elishama and jehoram the priests
 and they gave teaching in judah and had the book of the law of the lord with them they went through all the towns of judah teaching the people
 and the fear of the lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round judah so that they made no wars against jehoshaphat
 and some of the philistines took offerings to jehoshaphat and made him payments of silver and the arabians gave him flocks seven thousand seven hundred sheep and seven thousand seven hundred he goats
 jehoshaphat became greater and greater and made strong towers and store towns in judah
 he had much property in the towns of judah he had forces of armed men great and strong in jerusalem
 this is the number of them listed by their families the captains of thousands of judah adnah the captain and with him three hundred thousand men of war
 second to him jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and eighty thousand
 after him amasiah the son of zichri who freely gave himself to the lord and with him two hundred thousand men of war
 and the captains of benjamin eliada a great man of war and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and body covers
 and after him jehozabad and with him a hundred and eighty thousand trained for war
 these were the men who were waiting on the king in addition to those placed by the king in the walled towns through all judah
 now jehoshaphat had great wealth and honour and his son was married to ahabs daughter
 and after some years he went down to samaria to see ahab and ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen and he got jehoshaphat to go with him to ramoth gilead
 for ahab king of israel said to jehoshaphat king of judah will you go with me to ramoth gilead and he said i am as you are and my people as your people we will be with you in the war
 then jehoshaphat said to the king of israel let us now get directions from the lord
 so the king of israel got together all the prophets four hundred men and said to them am i to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and they said go up for god will give it into the hands of the king
 but jehoshaphat said is there no other prophet of the lord here from whom we may get directions
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat there is still one man by whom we may get directions from the lord but i have no love for him because he has never been a prophet of good to me but only of evil he is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so
 then the king of israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said go quickly and come back with micaiah the son of imla
 now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah were seated on their seats of authority dressed in their robes by the doorway into samaria and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them
 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made himself iron horns and said the lord says pushing back the aramaeans with these you will put an end to them completely
 and all the prophets said the same thing saying go up to ramoth gilead and it will go well for you for the lord will give it into the hands of the king
 now the servant who had gone to get micaiah said to him see now all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king so let your words be like theirs and say good things
 and micaiah said by the living lord whatever the lord says to me i will say
 when he came to the king the king said to him micaiah are we to go to ramoth gilead to make war or not and he said go up and it will go well for you and they will be given up into your hands
 and the king said to him have i not again and again put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the lord
 then he said i saw all israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper and the lord said these have no master let them go back every man to his house in peace
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me but of evil
 then he said give ear now to the word of the lord i saw the lord seated on his seat of power and all the army of heaven in their places at his right hand and at his left
 and the lord said how may ahab king of israel be tricked into going up to ramoth gilead to his death and one said one thing and one another
 then a spirit came forward and took his place before the lord and said i will get him to do it by a trick and the lord said to him how
 and he said i will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets and the lord said your trick will have its effect on him go out and do so
 and now see the lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours and the lord has said evil against you
 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and gave micaiah a blow on the side of his face saying where is the spirit of the lord whose word is in you
 and micaiah said truly you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe
 and the king of israel said take micaiah and send him back to amon the ruler of the town and to joash the kings son
 and say by the kings order this man is to be put in prison and given prison food till i come back in peace
 and micaiah said if you come back at all in peace the lord has not sent his word by me
 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramoth gilead
 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will make a change in my clothing so that i do not seem to be the king and will go into the fight but do you put on your robes so the king of israel made a change in his dress and they went to the fight
 now the king of aram had given orders to the captains of his war carriages saying make no attack on small or great but only on the king of israel
 so when the captains of the war carriages saw jehoshaphat they said it is the king of israel and turning about they came round him but jehoshaphat gave a cry and the lord came to his help and god sent them away from him
 now when the captains of the war carriages saw that he was not the king of israel they went back from going after him
 and a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction and gave the king of israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing so he said to the driver of his war carriage go to one side and take me away out of the army for i am badly wounded
 but the fight became more violent while the day went on and the king of israel was supported in his war carriage facing the aramaeans till the evening and by sundown he was dead
 and jehoshaphat king of judah went back to his house in jerusalem in peace
 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went to king jehoshaphat and said to him is it right for you to go to the help of evil doers loving the haters of the lord because of this the wrath of the lord has come on you
 but still there is some good in you for you have put away the wood pillars out of the land and have given your heart to the worship of god
 and jehoshaphat was living in jerusalem and he went out again among the people from beer sheba to the hill country of ephraim guiding them back to the lord the god of their fathers
 and he put judges through all the land in every walled town of judah
 and said to the judges take care what you do for you are judging not for man but for the lord and he is with you in the decisions you give
 so now let the fear of the lord be in you do your work with care for in the lord our god there is no evil or respect for high position or taking of payment to do wrong
 then in jerusalem he gave authority to certain of the levites and the priests and the heads of families of israel to give decisions for the lord and in the causes of those living in jerusalem
 and he gave them their orders saying you are to do your work in the fear of the lord in good faith and with a true heart
 and if any cause comes before you from your brothers living in their towns where the death punishment is in question or where there are questions of law or order or rules or decisions make them take care that they are not in the wrong before the lord so that wrath may not come on you and on your brothers do this and you yourselves will not be in the wrong
 and now amariah the chief priest is over you in all questions to do with the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the head of the family of judah in everything to do with the kings business and the levites will be overseers for you be strong to do the work and may the lord be with the upright
 now it was solomons purpose to put up a house for the name of the lord and a house for himself as king
 and solomon had seventy thousand men numbered for transport and eighty thousand for cutting stone in the mountains and three thousand six hundred as overseers
 and solomon sent to huram king of tyre saying as you did for my father david sending him cedar trees for the building of his house
 see  i am building a house for the name of the lord my god to be made holy to him where perfumes of sweet spices will be burned before him and the holy bread will be placed at all times and burned offerings will be offered morning and evening on the sabbaths and at the new moons and on the regular feasts of the lord our god this is a law for ever to israel
 and the house which i am building is to be great for our god is greater than all gods
 but who may have strength enough to make a house for him seeing that the heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be his resting place who am i then to make a house for him but i am building it only for the burning of perfume before him
 so now send me an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron in purple and red and blue and in the cutting of all sorts of ornament to be with the expert workmen who are here in judah and in jerusalem whom my father david got together
 and send me cedar trees cypress trees and sandal wood from lebanon for to my knowledge your servants are expert wood cutters in lebanon and my servants will be with yours
 to get trees for me in great numbers for the house which i am building is to be great and a wonder
 and i will give as food to your servants the wood cutters twenty thousand measures of grain and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand measures of wine and twenty thousand measures of oil
 then huram king of tyre sent solomon an answer in writing saying because of his love for his people the lord has made you king over them
 and huram said praise be to the lord the god of israel maker of heaven and earth who has given to david the king a wise son full of wisdom and good sense to be the builder of a house for the lord and a house for himself as king
 and now i am sending you a wise and expert man huram who is as my father
 the son of a woman of the daughters of dan whose father was a man of tyre an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron in stone and wood in purple and blue and fair linen and red trained in the cutting of every sort of ornament and the invention of every sort of design let him be given a place among your expert workmen and those of my lord your father david
 so now let my lord send to his servants the grain and the oil and the wine as my lord has said
 and we will have wood cut from lebanon as much as you have need of and will send it to you on flat boats by sea to joppa and from there you may take it up to jerusalem
 then solomon took the number of all the men from strange lands who were living in israel as his father david had done there were a hundred and fifty three thousand six hundred
 seventy thousand he put to the work of transport eighty thousand to cutting stone in the mountains and three thousand six hundred as overseers to put the people to work
 now after this the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them some of the meunim made war against jehoshaphat
 and they came to jehoshaphat with the news saying a great army is moving against you from edom across the sea and now they are in hazazon tamar  which is en gedi 
 then jehoshaphat in his fear went to the lord for directions and gave orders all through judah for the people to go without food
 and judah came together to make prayer for help from the lord from every town of judah they came to give worship to the lord
 and jehoshaphat took his place in the meeting of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord in front of the new open space
 and said o lord the god of our fathers are you not god in heaven are you not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations and in your hands are power and strength so that no one is able to keep his place against you
 did you not o lord our god after driving out the people of this land before your people israel give it to the seed of abraham your friend for ever
 and they made it their living place building there a holy house for your name and saying
 if evil comes on us the sword or punishment or disease or need of food we will come to this house and to you  for your name is in this house  crying to you in our trouble and you will give us salvation in answer to our cry
 and now see the children of ammon and moab and the people of mount seir whom you kept israel from attacking when they came out of egypt so that turning to one side they did not send destruction on them
 see now how as our reward they have come to send us out of your land which you have given us as our heritage
 o our god will you not be their judge for our strength is not equal to this great army which is coming against us and we are at a loss what to do but our eyes are on you
 and all judah were waiting before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children
 then before all the meeting the spirit of the lord came on jahaziel the son of zechariah son of benaiah son of jeiel son of mattaniah a levite and one of the family of asaph
 and he said give ear o judah and you people of jerusalem and you king jehoshaphat the lord says to you have no fear and do not be troubled on account of this great army for the fight is not yours but gods
 go down against them tomorrow see they are coming up by the slope of ziz at the end of the valley before the waste land of jeruel you will come face to face with them
 there will be no need for you to take up arms in this fight put yourselves in position and keep where you are and you will see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem have no fear and do not be troubled go out against them tomorrow for the lord is with you
 then jehoshaphat went down with his face to the earth and all judah and the people of jerusalem gave worship to the lord falling down before him
 and the levites the children of the kohathites and the korahites got to their feet and gave praise to the lord the god of israel with a loud voice
 and early in the morning they got up and went out to the waste land of tekoa and when they were going out jehoshaphat took his station and said to them give ear to me o judah and you people of jerusalem have faith in the lord your god and you will be safe have faith in his prophets and all will go well for you
 and after discussion with the people he put in their places those who were to make melody to the lord praising him in holy robes while they went at the head of the army and saying may the lord be praised for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 and at the first notes of song and praise the lord sent a surprise attack against the children of ammon and moab and the people of mount seir who had come against judah and they were overcome
 and the children of ammon and moab made an attack on the people of mount seir with a view to their complete destruction and when they had put an end to the people of seir everymans hand was turned against his neighbour for his destruction
 and judah came to the watchtower of the waste land and looking in the direction of the army they saw only dead bodies stretched on the earth no living man was to be seen
 and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take their goods from them they saw beasts in great numbers and wealth and clothing and things of value more than they were able to take away all this they took for themselves and they were three days getting it away there was so much
 on the fourth day they all came together in the valley of blessing and there they gave blessing to the lord for which cause that place has been named the valley of blessing to this day
 then all the men of judah and jerusalem went back with jehoshaphat at their head coming back to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them glad over their haters
 so they came to jerusalem with corded instruments and wind instruments into the house of the lord
 and the fear of god came on all the kingdoms of the lands when they had news of how the lord made war on those who came against israel
 so the kingdom of jehoshaphat was quiet for the lord gave him rest on every side
 and jehoshaphat was king over judah he was thirty five years old when he became king and he was ruling for twenty five years in jerusalem his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
 he went in the ways of his father asa not turning away but doing right in the eyes of the lord
 the high places however were not taken away and the hearts of the people were still not true to the god of their fathers
 now as for the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last they are recorded in the words of jehu the son of hanani which were put in the book of the kings of israel
 after this jehoshaphat king of judah became friends with ahaziah king of israel who did much evil
 together they made ships to go to tarshish building them in ezion geber
 then the word of eliezer the prophet the son of dodavahu of mareshah came against jehoshaphat saying because you have let yourself be joined with ahaziah the lord has sent destruction on your works and the ships were broken and were not able to go to tarshish
 and jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers and his body was put into the earth in the town of david and jehoram his son became king in his place
 and he had brothers sons of jehoshaphat azariah jehiel zechariah azariah michael and shephatiah all these were sons of jehoshaphat king of israel
 and their father gave them much silver and gold and things of great value as well as walled towns in judah but the kingdom he gave to jehoram because he was the oldest
 now when jehoram had taken his place over his fathers kingdom and had made his position safe he put all his brothers to death with the sword as well as some of the princes of israel
 jehoram was thirty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for eight years
 he went in the ways of the kings of israel and did as the family of ahab did for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the eyes of the lord
 but it was not the lords purpose to send destruction on the family of david because of the agreement he had made with david when he said he would give to him and to his sons a light for ever
 in his time edom made themselves free from the rule of judah and took a king for themselves
 then jehoram went over with his captains and all his war carriages  made an attack by night on the edomites whose forces were all round him  on the captains of the war carriages
 so edom made themselves free from the rule of judah to this day and at the same time libnah made itself free from his rule because he was turned away from the lord the god of his fathers
 and more than this he made high places in the mountains of judah teaching the people of jerusalem to go after false gods and guiding judah away from the true way
 and a letter came to him from elijah the prophet saying the lord the god of your father david says because you have not kept to the ways of your father jehoshaphat or the ways of asa king of judah
 but have gone in the way of the kings of israel and have made judah and the people of jerusalem go after false gods as the family of ahab did and because you have put to death your fathers sons your brothers who were better than yourself
 now truly the lord will send a great destruction on your people and your children and your wives and everything which is yours
 and you yourself will undergo the cruel pains of a disease in your stomach so that day by day your inside will be falling out because of the disease
 then the philistines and the arabians who are by ethiopia were moved by the lord to make war on jehoram
 and they came up against judah forcing a way into it and took away all the goods in the kings house as well as his sons and his wives so that he had no son but only jehoahaz the youngest
 and after all this the lord sent on him a disease of the stomach from which it was impossible for him to be made well
 and time went on and after two years his inside falling out because of the disease he came to his death in cruel pain and his people made no burning for him like the burning made for his fathers
 he was thirty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for eight years and at his death he was not regretted they put his body into the earth in the town of david but not in the resting place of the kings
 and the people of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his place for the band of men who came with the arabians to the army had put all the older sons to death so ahaziah the son of jehoram became king
 ahaziah was twenty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for one year his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri
 he went in the ways of the family of ahab for his mother was his teacher in evil doing
 and he did evil in the eyes of the lord as the family of ahab did for after the death of his father they were his guides to his destruction
 acting on their suggestion he went with jehoram son of ahab king of israel to make war on hazael king of aram at ramoth gilead and joram was wounded by the bowmen
 and he went back to jezreel to get well from the wounds which they had given him at ramah when he was fighting against hazael king of aram and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to jezreel to see jehoram the son of ahab because he was ill
 now by the purpose of god ahaziahs journey to see jehoram was the cause of his downfall for when he came there he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi who had been marked out by the lord for the destruction of the family of ahab
 now when jehu was effecting the punishment of the family of ahab he came to the princes of judah and the sons of ahaziahs brothers the servants of ahaziah and put them to death
 and he went in search of ahaziah and when they came where he was  for he was in a secret place in samaria  they took him to jehu and put him to death then they put his body to rest in the earth for they said he is the son of jehoshaphat whose heart was true to the lord so the family of ahaziah had no power to keep the kingdom
 now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom of judah put to death
 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king secretly took joash the son of ahaziah away from among the kings sons who were put to death and put him and the woman who took care of him in a bedroom so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest and sister of ahaziah kept him safe from athaliah so that she did not put him to death
 and she kept him safe with her in the house of god for six years while athaliah was ruling the land
 in the seventh year jehoiada made himself strong and made an agreement with the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham ishmael the son of jehohanan azariah the son of obed maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri
 and they went through judah getting together the levites and the heads of families in israel from all the towns of judah and they came to jerusalem
 and all the people made an agreement with the king in the house of god and he said to them truly the kings son will be king as the lord has said about the sons of david
 this is what you are to do let a third of you of the priests and levites who come in on the sabbath keep the doors
 and a third are to be stationed at the kings house and a third at the doorway of the horses while all the people are waiting in the open spaces round the house of the lord
 but let no one come into the house of the lord but only the priests and those of the levites who have work to do there they may go in for they are holy but the rest of the people are to keep the orders of the lord
 and the levites are to make a circle round the king every man being armed and any man who comes into the house is to be put to death you are to keep with the king when he comes in and when he goes out
 so the levites and all judah did as jehoiada the priest had given them orders every one took with him his men those who were to come in and those who were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada had not sent away the divisions
 then jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body covers which had been king davids and which were kept in the house of god
 and he put all the people in position every man with his instruments of war in his hand from the right side of the house to the left by the altar and the house and all round the king
 then they made the kings son come out and they put the crown on his head and gave him the arm bands and made him king and jehoiada and his sons put the holy oil on him and said long life to the king
 now athaliah hearing the noise of the people running and praising the king came to the people in the house of the lord
 and looking she saw the king in his place by the pillar at the doorway and the captains and the horns by his side and all the people of the land were giving signs of joy and sounding the horns and the makers of melody were playing on instruments of music taking the chief part in the song of praise then athaliah violently parting her robes said broken faith broken faith 
 then jehoiada the priest gave orders to the captains of hundreds who had authority over the army saying take her outside the lines and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword for the priest said let her not be put to death in the house of the lord
 so they put their hands on her and she went to the kings house by the doorway of the kings horses and there she was put to death
 and jehoiada made an agreement between the lord and all the people and the king that they would be the lords people
 then all the people went to the house of baal and had it pulled down and its altars and images broken up and mattan the priest of baal they put to death before the altars
 and jehoiada put the work and the care of the house of the lord into the hands of the priests and the levites who had been grouped in divisions by david to make burned offerings to the lord as it is recorded in the law of moses with joy and song as david had said
 and he put door keepers at the doors of the lords house to see that no one who was unclean in any way might come in
 then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and they came down with the king from the house of the lord through the higher doorway into the kings house and put the king on the seat of the kingdom
 so all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet for they had put athaliah to death with the sword
 joash was seven years old when he became king and he was ruling for forty years in jerusalem his mothers name was zibiah of beer sheba
 and joash did what was right in the eyes of the lord as long as jehoiada the priest was living
 and jehoiada took two wives for him and he became the father of sons and daughters
 now after this joash had a desire to put the house of the lord into good order again
 and getting together the priests and levites he said to them go out into the towns of judah year by year and get from all israel money to keep the house of your god in good condition and see that this is done without loss of time the levites however were slow in doing so
 then the king sent for jehoiada the chief priest and said to him why have you not given the levites orders that the tax fixed by moses the servant of the lord and by the meeting of israel for the tent of witness is to be got in from judah and jerusalem and handed over
 for the house of the lord had been broken up by athaliah that evil woman and her sons and all its holy things they had given to the baals
 so at the kings order they made a chest and put it outside the doorway of the house of the lord
 and an order was sent out through all judah and jerusalem that payment was to be made to the lord of the tax which moses the servant of god had put on israel in the waste land
 and all the chiefs and all the people came gladly and put their money into the chest till they had all given
 so when the chest was taken to the kings servants by the levites and they saw that there was much money in it the kings scribe and the chief priests servant took the money out and put the chest back in its place they did this day by day and got together a great amount of money
 then the king and jehoiada gave it to those who were responsible for getting the work done on the lords house and with it they got wall builders and woodworkers and metal workers to put the house of the lord in good order again
 so the workmen did their work making good what was damaged and building up the house of god till it was strong and beautiful again
 and when the work was done they took the rest of the money to the king and jehoiada and it was used for making the vessels for the house of the lord all the vessels needed for the offerings the spoons and the vessels of gold and silver and as long as jehoiada was living the regular burned offerings were offered in the house of the lord
 but jehoiada became old and full of days and he came to his end he was a hundred and thirty years old at the time of his death
 and they put him into his last resting place in the town of david among the kings because he had done good in israel for god and for his house
 now after the death of jehoiada the chiefs of judah came and went down on their faces before the king then the king gave ear to them
 and they gave up the house of the lord god of their fathers and became worshippers of pillars of wood and of the images and because of this sin of theirs wrath came on judah and jerusalem
 and the lord sent them prophets to make them come back to him and they gave witness against them but they would not give ear
 then the spirit of god came on zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest and getting up before the people he said to them god has said why do you go against the orders of the lord so that everything goes badly for you because you have given up the lord he has given you up
 but when they had made a secret design against him he was stoned with stones by the kings order in the outer square of the lords house
 so king joash did not keep in mind how good jehoiada his father had been to him but put his son to death and in the hour of his death he said may the lord see it and take payment 
 now in the spring the army of the aramaeans came up against him they came against judah and jerusalem putting to death all the great men of the people and sending all the goods they took from them to the king of damascus
 for though the army of aram was only a small one the lord gave a very great army into their hands because they had given up the lord the god of their fathers so they put into effect the punishment of joash
 and when they had gone away from him  for he was broken with disease  his servants made a secret design against him because of the blood of the son of jehoiada the priest and they put him to death on his bed and they put his body into the earth in the town of david but not in the resting place of the kings
 those who made designs against him were zabad the son of shimeath an ammonite woman and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabite woman
 now the story of his sons and all the words said by the prophet against him and the building up again of the lords house are recorded in the account in the book of the kings and amaziah his son became king in his place
 amaziah was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for twenty nine years his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord but his heart was not completely true to the lord
 now when he became strong in the kingdom he put to death those men who had taken the life of the king his father
 but he did not put their children to death for he kept the orders of the lord recorded in the book of the law of moses saying the fathers are not to be put to death for their children or the children for their fathers but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
 then amaziah got all judah together and put them in order by their families even all judah and benjamin under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and he had those of twenty years old and over numbered and they came to three hundred thousand of the best fighting men trained for war and in the use of the spear and the body cover
 and for a hundred talents of silver he got a hundred thousand fighting men from israel
 but a man of god came to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with you for the lord is not with israel that is the children of ephraim
 but go yourself and be strong in war god will not let you go down before those who are fighting against you for god has power to give help or to send you down before your attackers
 then amaziah said to the man of god but what is to be done about the hundred talents which i have given for the armed band of israel and the man of god in answer said god is able to give you much more than this
 so amaziah separating the armed band which had come to him from ephraim sent them back again which made them very angry with judah and they went back burning with wrath
 then amaziah took heart and went out at the head of his people and came to the valley of salt where he put to death ten thousand of the children of seir
 and ten thousand more the children of israel took living and made them go up to the top of the rock pushing them down from the top of the rock so that their bodies were broken by the fall
 but the men of the band which amaziah sent back and did not take with him to the fight made attacks on the towns of judah from samaria to beth horon putting to death three thousand of their people and taking away a great store of their goods
 now when amaziah came back from the destruction of the edomites he took the gods of the children of seir and made them his gods worshipping them and burning offerings before them
 and so the wrath of the lord was moved against amaziah and he sent a prophet to him who said why have you gone after the gods of the people who have not given their people salvation from your hands
 but while he was talking to him the king said to him have we made you one of the kings government say no more or it will be the cause of your death then the prophet gave up protesting and said it is clear to me that gods purpose is your destruction because you have done this and have not given ear to my words
 then amaziah king of judah acting on the suggestion of his servants sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us have a meeting face to face
 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thorn tree in lebanon sent to the cedar in lebanon saying give your daughter to my son for a wife and a beast from the woodland in lebanon went by crushing the thorn under his feet
 you say see i have overcome edom and your heart is lifted up with pride now keep in your country why do you make causes of trouble putting yourself and judah with you in danger of downfall
 but amaziah gave no attention and this was the purpose of god so that he might give them up into the hands of joash because they had gone after the gods of edom
 and so joash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah came face to face at beth shemesh in judah
 and judah was overcome before israel and they went in flight every man to his tent
 and joash king of israel made amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz prisoner at beth shemesh and took him to jerusalem and he had the wall of jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of ephraim to the doorway in the angle four hundred cubits
 and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the lord under the care of obed edom and all the wealth from the kings house as well as those whose lives would be the price of broken faith and went back to samaria
 amaziah son of joash king of judah went on living for fifteen years after the death of joash the son of jehoahaz king of israel
 now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last are they not recorded in the book of the kings of judah and israel
 now from the time when amaziah gave up worshipping the lord they made secret designs against him in jerusalem and he went in flight to lachish but they sent to lachish after him and put him to death there
 and they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in the town of david
 then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father amaziah
 he was the builder of eloth which he got back for judah after the death of the king
 uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for fifty two years his mothers name was jechiliah of jerusalem
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father amaziah had done
 he gave himself to searching after god in the days of zechariah who made men wise in the fear of god and as long as he was true to the lord god made things go well for him
 he went out and made war against the philistines pulling down the walls of gath and jabneh and ashdod and building towns in the country round ashdod and among the philistines
 and god gave him help against the philistines and against the arabians living in gur baal and against the meunim
 the ammonites gave offerings to uzziah and news of him went out as far as the limit of egypt for he became very great in power
 uzziah made towers in jerusalem at the doorway in the angle and at the doorway in the valley and at the turn of the wall arming them
 and he put up towers in the waste land and made places for storing water for he had much cattle in the low hills and in the table land and he had farmers and vine keepers in the mountains and in the fertile land for he was a lover of farming
 in addition uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war in bands as they had been listed by jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the authority of hananiah one of the kings captains
 the heads of families the strong men of war were two thousand six hundred
 and under their orders was a trained army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred of great strength in war helping the king against any who came against him
 and uzziah had all these forces armed with body covers and spears and head covers and coats of metal and bows and stones for sending from leather bands
 and in jerusalem he made machines the invention of expert men to be placed on the towers and angles of the walls for sending arrows and great stones and his name was honoured far and wide for he was greatly helped till he was strong
 but when he had become strong his heart was lifted up in pride causing his destruction and he did evil against the lord his god for he went into the temple of the lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes
 and azariah the priest went in after him with eighty of the lords priests who were strong men
 and they made protests to uzziah the king and said to him the burning of perfumes uzziah is not your business but that of the priests the sons of aaron who have been made holy for this work go out of the holy place for you have done wrong and it will not be to your honour before god
 then uzziah was angry and he had in his hand a vessel for burning perfume and while his wrath was bitter against the priests the mark of the lepers disease came out on his brow before the eyes of the priests in the house of the lord by the altar of perfumes
 and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looking at him saw the mark of the leper on his brow and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away for the lords punishment had come on him
 so king uzziah was a leper till the day of his death living separately in his private house for he was cut off from the house of god and jotham his son was ruling over his house judging the people of the land
 now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last were recorded by isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
 so uzziah went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the resting place of the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son became king in his place
 jotham was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for sixteen years and his mothers name was jerushah the daughter of zadok
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father uzziah had done but he did not go into the temple of the lord and the people still went on in their evil ways
 he put up the higher doorway of the house of the lord and did much building on the wall of the ophel
 in addition he made towns in the hill country of judah and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands
 he went to war with the king of the children of ammon and overcame them that year the children of ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley and the children of ammon gave him the same amount the second year and the third
 so jotham became strong because in all his ways he made the lord his guide
 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways are recorded in the book of the kings of israel and judah
 he was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for sixteen years
 and jotham went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in the town of david and ahaz his son became king in his place
 ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for sixteen years he did not do what was right in the eyes of the lord like david his father
 but he went in the ways of the kings of israel and made images of metal for the baals
 more than this he had offerings burned in the valley of the son of hinnom and made his children go through fire copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the lord had sent out of the land before the children of israel
 and he made offerings and had perfumes burned in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
 so the lord his god gave him up into the hands of the king of aram and they overcame him and took away a great number of his people as prisoners to damascus then he was given into the hands of the king of israel who sent great destruction on him
 for pekah the son of remaliah in one day put to death a hundred and twenty thousand men of judah all of them good fighting men because they had given up the lord the god of their fathers
 and zichri a great fighting man of ephraim put to death maaseiah the kings son and azrikam the controller of his house and elkanah who was second in authority to the king
 and the children of israel took away as prisoners from their brothers two hundred thousand women and sons and daughters and a great store of their goods and took them to samaria
 but a prophet of the lord was there named oded and he went out in front of the army which was coming into samaria and said to them truly because the lord the god of your fathers was angry with judah he gave them up into your hands and you have put them to death in an outburst of wrath stretching up to heaven
 and now your purpose is to keep the children of judah and jerusalem as men servants and women servants under your yoke but are there no sins against the lord your god to be seen among yourselves
 and now give ear to me and send back the prisoners whom you have taken from your brothers for the wrath of the lord is burning against you
 then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai put themselves against those who had come from the war
 and said to them you are not to let these prisoners come here for what you are designing to do will be a cause of sin against the lord to us making even greater our sin and our wrongdoing which now are great enough and his wrath is burning against israel
 so the armed men gave up the prisoners and the goods they had taken to the heads and the meeting of the people
 and those men who have been named went up and took the prisoners clothing those among them who were uncovered with things from the goods which had been taken in the war and putting robes on them and shoes on their feet and they gave them food and drink and oil for their bodies and seating all the feeble among them on asses they took them to jericho the town of palm trees to their people and then went back to samaria
 at that time king ahaz sent for help to the king of assyria
 for the edomites had come again attacking judah and taking away prisoners
 and the philistines forcing their way into the towns of the lowlands and the south of judah had taken beth shemesh and aijalon and gederoth and soco with their daughter towns as well as timnah and gimzo and their daughter towns and were living there
 for the lord made judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he had given up all self control in judah sinning greatly against the lord
 then tiglath pileser king of assyria came to him but was a cause of trouble and not of strength to him
 for ahaz took a part of the wealth from the house of the lord and from the house of the king and of the great men and gave it to the king of assyria but it was no help to him
 and in the time of his trouble this same king ahaz did even more evil against the lord
 for he made offerings to the gods of damascus who were attacking him and said because the gods of the kings of aram are giving them help i will make offerings to them so that they may give me help but they were the cause of his downfall and of that of all israel
 and ahaz got together the vessels of the house of god cutting up all the vessels of the house of god and shutting the doors of the lords house and he made altars in every part of jerusalem
 and in every town of judah he made high places where perfumes were burned to other gods awaking the wrath of the lord the god of his fathers
 now the rest of his acts and all his ways first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of judah and israel
 and ahaz went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the earth in jerusalem but they did not put him in the resting place of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son became king in his place
 hezekiah became king when he was twenty five years old and he was king in jerusalem for twenty nine years and his mothers name was abijah the daughter of zechariah
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father david had done
 in the first year of his rule in the first month opening the doors of the lords house he made them strong
 and he sent for the priests and the levites and got them together in the wide place on the east side
 and said to them give ear to me o levites now make yourselves holy and make holy the house of the lord the god of your fathers and take away everything unclean from the holy place
 for our fathers have done evil sinning in the eyes of the lord our god and have given him up turning away their faces from the house of the lord and turning their backs on him
 the doors of his house have been shut and the lights put out no perfumes have been burned or offerings made to the god of israel in his holy place
 and so the wrath of the lord has come on judah and jerusalem and he has given them up to be a cause of fear and wonder and shame as your eyes have seen
 for see our fathers have been put to death with the sword and our sons and daughters and wives have been taken away prisoners because of this
 now it is my purpose to make an agreement with the lord the god of israel so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from us
 my sons take care now for you have been marked out by the lord to come before him and to be his servants burning offerings to him
 then the levites took their places mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah among the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehallelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah
 and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeuel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah
 and of the sons of heman jehuel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel
 and they got their brothers together and made themselves holy and went in as the king had said by the word of the lord to make the house of the lord clean
 and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord to make it clean and everything unclean which was to be seen in the temple of the lord they took out into the outer square of the lords house and the levites got it together and took it away to the stream kidron
 on the first day of the first month the work of making the house holy was started and on the eighth day they came to the covered way of the lord in eight days they made the lords house holy and on the sixteenth day of the first month the work was done
 then they went in to king hezekiah and said we have made all the house of the lord clean as well as the altar of burned offerings with all its vessels and the table for the holy bread with all its vessels
 and all the vessels which were turned out by king ahaz in his sin while he was king we have put in order and made holy and now they are in their places before the altar of the lord
 then hezekiah the king got up early and got together the great men of the town and went up to the house of the lord
 and they took with them seven oxen and seven male sheep and seven lambs and seven he goats as a sin offering for the kingdom and for the holy house and for judah and he gave orders to the sons of aaron the priests that these were to be offered on the altar of the lord
 so they put the oxen to death and their blood was given to the priests to be drained out against the altar then they put the male sheep to death draining out their blood against the altar and they put the lambs to death draining out their blood against the altar
 then they took the he goats for the sin offering placing them before the king and the meeting of the people and they put their hands on them
 and the priests put them to death and made a sin offering with their blood on the altar to take away the sin of all israel for the king gave orders that the burned offering and the sin offering were for all israel
 then he put the levites in their places in the house of the lord with brass and corded instruments of music as ordered by david and gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet for the order was the lords given by his prophets
 so the levites took their places with davids instruments and the priests with their horns
 and hezekiah gave the word for the burned offering to be offered on the altar and when the burned offering was started then the song of the lord was started with the blowing of horns and with all the instruments of david king of israel
 and all the people gave worship to the sound of songs and the blowing of horns and this went on till the burned offering was ended
 and at the end of the offering the king and all who were present with him gave worship with bent heads
 then king hezekiah and the captains gave orders to the levites to give praise to god in the words of david and asaph the seer and they made songs of praise with joy and with bent heads gave worship
 then hezekiah made answer and said now that you have given yourselves to the lord come near and take offerings and praise offerings into the house of the lord so all the people took in offerings and praise offerings and those whose hearts were moved took in burned offerings
 the number of burned offerings which the people took in was seventy oxen a hundred male sheep and two hundred lambs all these were for burned offerings to the lord
 and the holy things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep
 there were not enough priests for the work of cutting up all the burned offerings so their brothers the levites gave them help till the work was done and the priests had made themselves holy for the levites were more upright in heart to make themselves holy than the priests
 and there was a great amount of burned offerings with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burned offering so the work of the lords house was put in order
 and hezekiah and all the people were full of joy because god had made the people ready for the thing was done suddenly
 then solomon made a start at building the house of the lord on mount moriah in jerusalem where the lord had been seen by his father david in the place which david had made ready in the grain floor of ornan the jebusite
 the building was started in the second month in the fourth year of his rule
 and solomon put the base of the house of god in position by the older measure it was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide
 and the covered way in front of the house was twenty cubits long as wide as the house and a hundred and twenty cubits high all plated inside with the best gold
 and the greater house was roofed with cypress wood plated with the best gold and ornamented with designs of palm trees and chains
 and the house was made beautiful with stones of great value and the gold was gold of parvaim
 all the house was plated with gold the supports the steps the walls and the doors and the walls were ornamented with designs of winged ones
 and he made the most holy place it was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide like the greater house and was plated all over with the best gold six hundred talents were used for it
 and fifty shekels weight of gold was used for the nails he had all the higher rooms plated with gold
 and in the most holy place he made images of two winged beings covering them with gold
 their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across one wing five cubits long touching the wall of the house and the other of the same size meeting the wing of the other winged one
 and in the same way the wings of the other five cubits long were stretched out one touching the wall and the other meeting the wing of the first winged one
 their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across they were placed upright on their feet facing the inner part of the house
 and he made the veil of blue and purple and red of the best linen worked with winged ones
 and in front of the house he made two pillars thirty five cubits high with crowns on the tops of them five cubits high
 and he made chains like neck ornaments and put them on the tops of the pillars and a hundred apples on the chains
 he put up the pillars in front of the temple one on the right side and one on the left naming the one on the right jachin and that on the left boaz
 then hezekiah sent word to all israel and judah and sent letters to ephraim and manasseh requesting them to come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover to the lord the god of israel
 for the king after discussion with his chiefs and all the body of the people in jerusalem had made a decision to keep the passover in the second month
 it was not possible to keep it at that time because not enough priests had made themselves holy and the people had not come together in jerusalem
 and the thing was right in the eyes of the king and all the people
 so it was ordered that word was to be sent out through all israel from beer sheba to dan that they were to come to keep the passover to the lord the god of israel at jerusalem because they had not kept it in great numbers in agreement with the law
 so runners went with letters from the king and his chiefs through all israel and judah by the order of the king saying o children of israel come back again to the lord the god of abraham isaac and israel so that he may come again to that small band of you which has been kept safe out of the hands of the kings of assyria
 do not be like your fathers and your brothers who were sinners against the lord the god of their fathers so that he made them a cause of fear as you see
 now do not be hard hearted as your fathers were but give yourselves to the lord and come into his holy place which he has made his for ever and be the servants of the lord your god so that the heat of his wrath may be turned away from you
 for if you come back to the lord those who took away your brothers and your children will have pity on them and let them come back to this land for the lord your god is full of grace and mercy and his face will not be turned away from you if you come back to him
 so the runners went from town to town through all the country of ephraim and manasseh as far as zebulun but they were laughed at and made sport of
 however some of asher and manasseh and zebulun put away their pride and came to jerusalem
 and in judah the power of god gave them one heart to do the orders of the king and the captains which were taken as the word of the lord
 so a very great number of people came together at jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month
 and they got to work and took away all the altars in jerusalem and they put all the vessels for burning perfumes into the stream kidron
 then on the fourteenth day of the second month they put the passover lambs to death and the priests and the levites were shamed and made themselves holy and took burned offerings into the house of the lord
 and they took their places in their right order as it was ordered in the law of moses the man of god the priests draining out on the altar the blood given them by the levites
 for there were still a number of the people there who had not made themselves holy so the levites had to put passover lambs to death for those who were not clean to make them holy to the lord
 for a great number of the people from ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not made themselves clean but they took the passover meal though not in the right way for hezekiah had made prayer for them saying may the good lord have mercy on everyone
 who with all his heart is turned to god the lord the god of his fathers even if he has not been made clean after the rules of the holy place
 and the lord gave ear to hezekiah and made the people well
 so the children of israel who were present in jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great joy and the levites and the priests gave praise to the lord day by day making melody to the lord with loud instruments
 and hezekiah said kind words to the levites who were expert in the ordering of the worship of the lord so they kept the feast for seven days offering peace offerings and praising the lord the god of their fathers
 and by the desire of all the people the feast went on for another seven days and they kept the seven days with joy
 for hezekiah king of judah gave to the people for offerings a thousand oxen and seven thousand sheep and the rulers gave a thousand oxen and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests made themselves holy
 and all the people of judah with the priests and the levites and those who had come from israel and men from other lands who had come from israel or who were living in judah were glad with great joy
 so there was great joy in jerusalem for nothing like this had been seen in jerusalem from the time of solomon the son of david king of israel
 then the priests and the levites gave the people a blessing and the voice of their prayer went up to the holy place of god in heaven
 now when all this was over all the men of israel who were present went out into the towns of judah causing the stone pillars to be broken up and the wood pillars to be cut down pulling down the high places and the altars in all judah and benjamin as well as in ephraim and manasseh till all were gone then all the children of israel went back to their towns every man to his property
 then hezekiah put in order the divisions of the priests and levites every man in his division in relation to his work for the burned offerings and peace offerings and for the ordering of worship and for giving praise at the doors of the lords house
 and he gave the kings part of his private property for the burned offerings that is for the morning and evening offerings and the offerings for the sabbath and the new moons and the regular feasts as it is recorded in the law of the lord
 in addition he gave orders to the people of jerusalem to give to the priests and levites that part which was theirs by right so that they might be strong in keeping the law of the lord
 and when the order was made public straight away the children of israel gave in great amounts the first fruits of their grain and wine and oil and honey and of the produce of their fields and they took in a tenth part of everything a great store
 and the children of israel and judah who were living in the towns of judah came with the tenth part of their oxen and sheep and a tenth of all the holy things which were to be given to the lord their god and put them in great masses
 the first store of things was put down in the third month and in the seventh month the masses were complete
 and when hezekiah and the rulers came and saw all the store of goods they gave praise to the lord and to his people israel
 then hezekiah put questions to the priests and levites about the store of goods
 and azariah the chief priest of the family of zadok said in answer from the time when the people first came with their offerings into the house of the lord we have had food enough and more than enough for the blessing of the lord is on his people and there is this great store which has not been used
 then hezekiah said that store rooms were to be made ready in the house of the lord and this was done
 and in them they put all the offerings and the tenths and the holy things keeping nothing back and over them was conaniah the levite with shimei his brother second to him
 and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the directions of conaniah and shimei his brother by the order of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god
 and kore the son of imnah the levite the keeper of the east door had control of the offerings freely given to god and the distribution of the offerings of the lord and the most holy things
 and under him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah and amariah and shecaniah in the towns of the priests who were made responsible for giving it to all their brothers by divisions to small and great
 as well as to all the males of three years old and over listed by their families who went into the house of the lord to do what was needed day by day for their special work with their divisions
 and the families of the priests were listed by their fathers names but the levites of twenty years old and over were listed in relation to their work in their divisions
 and in the lists were all their little ones and their wives and their sons and daughters through all the people they made themselves holy in the positions which they were given
 and as for the sons of aaron the priests living in the country on the outskirts of their towns every different town there were men marked out by name to give their part of the goods to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed among the levites
 this hezekiah did through all judah he did what was good and right and true before the lord his god
 and for everything he undertook in connection with the work of the house of god and his law and orders he got directions from god and did it with serious purpose and things went well for him
 now after these things and this true hearted work sennacherib king of assyria came into judah and put his army in position before the walled towns of judah designing to make his way into them by force
 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib had come for the purpose of fighting against jerusalem
 he took up with his rulers and men of war the question of stopping up the water springs outside the town and they gave him their support
 so they got together a great number of people and had all the water springs and the stream flowing through the land stopped up saying why let the kings of assyria come and have much water
 then he took heart building up the wall where it was broken down and making its towers higher and building another wall outside and he made strong the millo in the town of david and got together a great store of all sorts of instruments of war
 and he put war chiefs over the people and sent for them all to come together to him in the wide place at the doorway into the town and to give them heart he said to them
 be strong and take heart have no fear and do not be troubled on account of the king of assyria and all the great army with him for there is a greater with us
 with him is an arm of flesh but we have the lord our god helping us and fighting for us and the people put their faith in what hezekiah king of judah said
 after this sennacherib king of assyria sent his servants to jerusalem  at that time he was stationed with all his army in front of lachish  to say to hezekiah and all the men of judah in jerusalem
 sennacherib king of assyria says in what are you placing your hope waiting here in the walled town of jerusalem
 is it not hezekiah who has got you to do it causing your death from need of food and water by saying the lord our god will give us salvation out of the hands of the king of assyria
 has not this same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars saying to judah and jerusalem give worship before one altar only burning offerings on it
 have you no knowledge of what i and my fathers have done to all the peoples of every land were the gods of the nations of those lands able to keep their land from falling into my hands
 who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers put to destruction who was able to keep his people safe from my hands and is it possible that your god will keep you safe from my hands
 so do not be tricked by hezekiah or let him get you to do this and do not put any faith in what he says for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to keep his people safe from my hands or the hands of my fathers how much less will your god keep you safe from my hands 
 and his servants said even more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah
 and he sent letters in addition to put shame on the lord the god of israel and to say evil against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands have not been able to keep their people safe from my hands no more will the god of hezekiah keep his people safe from my hands
 these things they said crying out with a loud voice in the jews language to the people of jerusalem who were on the wall with the purpose of troubling them and putting fear into them so that they might take the town
 talking of the god of jerusalem as if he was like the gods of the peoples of the earth the work of mens hands
 and hezekiah the king and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz made prayer because of this crying out to heaven
 and the lord sent an angel who put to death all the men of war and the chiefs and the captains in the army of the king of assyria so he went back to his country in shame and when he came into the house of his god his sons the offspring of his body put him to death there with the sword
 so the lord gave hezekiah and the people of jerusalem salvation from the power of sennacherib the king of assyria and from all others giving them rest on every side
 and great numbers came to jerusalem with offerings for the lord and things of great price for hezekiah king of judah so that he was honoured among all nations from that time
 in those days hezekiah was ill and near death and he made prayer to the lord and the lord in answer gave him a sign
 but hezekiah did not do as had been done to him for his heart was lifted up in pride and so wrath came on him and on judah and jerusalem
 but then hezekiah in sorrow for what he had done put away his pride and he and all jerusalem made themselves low so that the wrath of the lord did not come on them in hezekiahs life time
 and hezekiah had very great wealth and honour and he made himself store houses for his gold and silver and jewels and spices and for body covers and all sorts of beautiful vessels
 and store houses for the produce of grain and wine and oil and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks
 and he made towns for himself and got together much property in flocks and herds for god had given him great wealth
 it was hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of gihon stopped and the water taken down on the west side of the town of david in everything he undertook hezekiah did well
 however in the business of the representatives sent by the rulers of babylon to get news of the wonder which had taken place in the land god gave up guiding him testing him to see what was in his heart
 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and the good he did are recorded in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the kings of judah and israel
 so hezekiah went to rest with his fathers and they put his body into the higher part of the resting places of the sons of david and all judah and the people of jerusalem gave him honour at his death and manasseh his son became king in his place
 manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he was ruling for fifty five years in jerusalem
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the lord had sent out of the land before the children of israel
 for he put up again the high places which had been pulled down by his father hezekiah and he made altars for the baals and pillars of wood and was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven
 and he made altars in the house of the lord of which the lord had said in jerusalem will my name be for ever
 and he made altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the lord
 more than this he made his children go through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom and he made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future and unnatural powers and gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder workers he did much evil in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath
 and he put the image he had made in the house of god the house of which god had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem the town which i have made mine out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever
 and never again will i let the feet of israel be moved out of the land which i have given to their fathers if only they will take care to do all my orders even all the law and the orders and the rules given to them by moses
 and manasseh made judah and the people of jerusalem go out of the true way so that they did more evil than those nations whom the lord gave up to destruction before the children of israel
 and the word of the lord came to manasseh and his people but they gave no attention
 so the lord sent against them the captains of the army of assyria who made manasseh a prisoner and took him away in chains to babylon
 and crying out to the lord his god in his trouble he made himself low before the god of his fathers
 and made prayer to him and in answer to his prayer god let him come back to jerusalem and to his kingdom then manasseh was certain that the lord was god
 after this he made an outer wall for the town of david on the west side of gihon in the valley as far as the way into the town by the fish doorway and he put a very high wall round the ophel and he put captains of the army in all the walled towns of judah
 he took away the strange gods and the image out of the house of the lord and all the altars he had put up on the hill of the lords house and in jerusalem and put them out of the town
 and he put the altar of the lord in order offering peace offerings and praise offerings on it and said that all judah were to be servants of the lord the god of israel
 however the people still made offerings in the high places but only to the lord their god
 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer to his god and the words which the seers said to him in the name of the lord the god of israel are recorded among the acts of the kings of israel
 and the prayer which he made to god and how god gave him an answer and all his sin and his wrongdoing and the places where he made high places and put up pillars of wood and images before he put away his pride are recorded in the history of the seers
 so manasseh went to rest with his fathers and they put his body to rest in his house and amon his son became king in his place
 amon was twenty two years old when he became king and he was ruling for two years in jerusalem
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as manasseh his father had done and amon made offerings to all the images which his father manasseh had made and was their servant
 he did not make himself low before the lord as his father manasseh had done but went on sinning more and more
 and his servants made a secret design against him and put him to death in his house
 but the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against king amon and made his son josiah king in his place
 josiah was eight years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for thirty one years
 and he did what was right in the eyes of the lord walking in the ways of his father david without turning to the right hand or to the left
 in the eighth year of his rule while he was still young his heart was first turned to the god of his father david and in the twelfth year he undertook the clearing away of all the high places and the pillars and the images of wood and metal from judah and jerusalem
 he had the altars of the baals broken down while he himself was present and the sun images which were placed on high over them he had cut down and the pillars of wood and the metal images he had broken up and crushed to dust dropping the dust over the resting places of the dead who had made offerings to them
 and he had the bones of the priests burned on their altars and so he made judah and jerusalem clean
 and in all the towns of manasseh and ephraim and simeon as far as naphtali he made waste their houses round about
 he had the altars and the pillars of wood pulled down and the images crushed to dust and all the sun images cut down through all the land of israel and then he went back to jerusalem
 now in the eighteenth year of his rule when the land and the house had been made clean he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the ruler of the town and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to make good what was damaged in the house of the lord his god
 and they came to hilkiah the chief priest and gave him all the money which had been taken into the house of god which the levites the keepers of the door had got from manasseh and ephraim and those of israel who had not been taken away as prisoners and from all judah and benjamin and the people of jerusalem
 and they gave it to the overseers of the work of the lords house and the overseers gave it to the workmen working in the house for building it up and making good what was damaged
 even to the woodworkers and builders to get cut stone and wood for joining the structure together and for making boards for the houses which the kings of judah had given up to destruction
 and the men did the work well and those who had authority over them were jahath and obadiah levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites who were to be responsible for seeing that the work was done and others of the levites who were expert with instruments of music
 had authority over the transport workers giving directions to all who were doing any sort of work and among the levites there were scribes and overseers and door keepers
 now when they were taking out the money which had come into the lords house hilkiah the priest came across the book of the law of the lord which he had given by the mouth of moses
 then hilkiah said to shaphan the scribe i have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan
 and shaphan took the book to the king and he gave him an account of what had been done saying your servants are doing all they have been given to do
 they have taken out all the money which was in the lords house and have given it to the overseers and to the workmen
 then shaphan the scribe said to the king hilkiah the priest has given me a book and he made a start at reading some of it to the king
 and the king hearing the words of the law took his robe in his hands violently parting it as a sign of his grief
 and he gave orders to hilkiah and to ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying
 go and get directions from the lord for me and for those who are still in israel and for judah about the words of this book which has come to light for great is the wrath of the lord which has been let loose on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord or done what is recorded in this book
 so hilkiah and those whom the king sent went to huldah the woman prophet the wife of shallum the son of tokhath the son of hasrah the keeper of the robes  now she was living in jerusalem in the second part of the town  and they had talk with her about this thing
 and she said to them the lord the god of israel has said say to the man who sent you to me
 these are the words of the lord see i will send evil on this place and on its people even all the curses in the book which they have been reading before the king of judah
 because they have given me up burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the works of their hands so my wrath is let loose on this place and will not be put out
 but to the king of judah who sent you to get directions from the lord say this is what the lord the god of israel has said because you have given ear to my words
 and your heart was soft and you made yourself low before god on hearing his words about this place and its people and with weeping and signs of grief have made yourself low before me i have given ear to you says the lord god
 see i will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last resting place in peace and your eyes will not see all the evil which i will send on this place and on its people so they took this news back to the king
 then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of judah and of jerusalem
 and the king went up to the house of the lord with all the men of judah and the people of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people small and great and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the lord
 then the king taking his place by the pillar made an agreement before the lord to go in the way of the lord and to keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and with all his soul and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in this book
 and he made all the people in jerusalem and benjamin give their word to keep it and the people of jerusalem kept the agreement of god the god of their fathers
 josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the lands of the children of israel and made all who were in israel servants of the lord their god and as long as he was living they were true to the lord the god of their fathers
 and josiah kept a passover to the lord in jerusalem on the fourteenth day of the first month they put the passover lamb to death
 and he gave the priests their places making them strong for the work of the house of god
 and he said to the levites the teachers of all israel who were holy to the lord see the holy ark is in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel made it will no longer have to be transported on your backs now be the servants of the lord your god and his people israel
 and make yourselves ready in your divisions by your families as it is ordered in the writings of david king of israel and of solomon his son
 and take your positions in the holy place grouped in the families of your brothers the children of the people and for every division let there be a part of a family of the levites
 and put the passover lamb to death and make yourselves holy and make it ready for your brothers so that the orders given by the lord through moses may be done
 and josiah gave lambs and goats from the flock as passover offerings for all the people who were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand oxen these were from the kings private property
 and his captains freely gave an offering to the people the priests and the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel the rulers of the house of god gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen
 and conaniah and shemaiah and nethanel his brothers and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad the chiefs of the levites gave to the levites for the passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen
 so everything was made ready and the priests took their places with the levites in their divisions as the king had said
 and they put the passover lambs to death the blood being drained out by the priests when it was given to them and the levites did the skinning
 and they took away the burned offerings so that they might give them to be offered to the lord for the divisions of the families of the people as it is recorded in the book of moses and they did the same with the oxen
 and the passover lamb was cooked over the fire as it says in the law and the holy offerings were cooked in pots and basins and vessels and taken quickly to all the people
 and after that they made ready for themselves and for the priests for the priests the sons of aaron were offering the burned offerings and the fat till night so the levites made ready what was needed for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron
 and the sons of asaph the makers of melody were in their places as ordered by david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the kings seer and the door keepers were stationed at every door there was no need for them to go away from their places for their brothers the levites made ready for them
 so everything needed for the worship of the lord was made ready that same day for the keeping of the passover and the offering of burned offerings on the altar of the lord as king josiah had given orders
 and all the children of israel who were present kept the passover and the feast of unleavened bread at that time for seven days
 no passover like it had been kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet and not one of the kings of israel had ever kept a passover like the one kept by josiah and the priests and the levites and all those of judah and israel who were present and the people of jerusalem
 in the eighteenth year of the rule of josiah this passover was kept
 after all this and after josiah had put the house in order neco king of egypt went up to make war at carchemish by the river euphrates and josiah went out against him
 but he sent representatives to him saying what have i to do with you o king of judah i have not come against you this day but against those with whom i am at war and god has given me orders to go forward quickly keep out of gods way for he is with me or he will send destruction on you
 however josiah would not go back but keeping to his purpose of fighting against him and giving no attention to the words of neco which came from god he went forward to the fight in the valley of megiddo
 and the bowmen sent their arrows at king josiah and the king said to his servants take me away for i am badly wounded
 so his servants took him out of the line of war carriages and put him in his second carriage and took him to jerusalem where he came to his end and they put his body in the resting place of his fathers and in all judah and jerusalem there was great weeping for josiah
 and jeremiah made a song of grief for josiah and to this day josiah is named by all the makers of melody men and women in their songs of grief they made it a rule in israel and the songs are recorded among the songs of grief
 now the rest of the acts of josiah and the good he did in keeping with what is recorded in the law of the lord
 and all his acts first and last are recorded in the book of the kings of israel and judah
 then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in jerusalem in place of his father
 jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for three months
 then the king of egypt took the kingdom from him in jerusalem and put on the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
 and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem changing his name to jehoiakim and neco took his brother jehoahaz away to egypt
 jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for eleven years and he did evil in the eyes of the lord his god
 nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against him and took him away in chains to babylon
 and nebuchadnezzar took away some of the vessels of the lords house and put them in the house of his god in babylon
 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and the disgusting things he did and all there is to be said against him are recorded in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son became king in his place
 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for three months and ten days and he did evil in the eyes of the lord
 in the spring of the year king nebuchadnezzar sent and took him away to babylon with the beautiful vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his fathers brother king over judah and jerusalem
 zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for eleven years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord and did not make himself low before jeremiah the prophet who gave him the word of the lord
 and he took up arms against king nebuchadnezzar though he had made him take an oath by god but he made his neck stiff and his heart hard turning away from the lord the god of israel
 and more than this all the great men of judah and the priests and the people made their sin great turning to all the disgusting ways of the nations and they made unclean the house of the lord which he had made holy in jerusalem
 and the lord the god of their fathers sent word to them by his servants sending early and frequently because he had pity on his people and on his living place
 but they put shame on the servants of god making sport of his words and laughing at his prophets till the wrath of god was moved against his people till there was no help
 so he sent against them the king of the chaldaeans who put their young men to death with the sword in the house of their holy place and had no pity for any young man or virgin old man or white haired god gave them all into his hands
 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the stored wealth of the lords house and the wealth of the king and his chiefs he took away to babylon
 and the house of god was burned and the wall of jerusalem broken down all its great houses were burned with fire and all its beautiful vessels given up to destruction
 and all who had not come to death by the sword he took away prisoners to babylon and they became servants to him and to his sons till the kingdom of persia came to power
 so that the words of the lord which he said by the mouth of jeremiah might come true till the land had had pleasure in her sabbaths for as long as she was waste the land kept the sabbath till seventy years were complete
 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia in order that the words which the lord had said by the mouth of jeremiah might come true the spirit of cyrus king of persia was moved by the lord and he made a public statement and had it given out through all his kingdom and put in writing saying
 cyrus king of persia has said all the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the lord the god of heaven and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in jerusalem which is in judah whoever there is among you of all his people may the lord his god be with him and let him go up
 then he made a brass altar twenty cubits long twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high
 and he made the great water vessel of metal round in form measuring ten cubits across from edge to edge it was five cubits high and thirty cubits round
 and under it was a design of flowers all round it ten to a cubit circling the water vessel in two lines they were made from liquid metal at the same time as the water vessel
 it was supported on twelve oxen three facing to the north three to the west three to the south and three to the east the water vessel resting on top of them their back parts were all turned to the middle of it
 it was as thick as a mans open hand and the edge of it was curved like the edge of a cup like a lily flower it would take three thousand baths
 and he made ten washing vessels putting five on the right side and five on the left such things as were used in making the burned offering were washed in them but the great water vessel was to be used by the priests for washing themselves
 and he made the ten gold supports for the lights as directions had been given for them and he put them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left
 he made ten tables and put them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left and he made a hundred gold basins
 then he made the open space for the priests and the great open space and its doors plating the doors with brass
 he put the great water vessel on the right side of the house to the east facing south
 and huram made all the pots and the spades and the basins so he came to the end of all the work he did for king solomon in the house of god
 the two pillars and the two crowns on the tops of the pillars and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars
 and the four hundred apples for the network two lines of apples for the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars
 and he made the ten bases and the ten washing vessels which were on the bases
 the great water vessel with the twelve oxen under it
 all the pots and the spades and the meat hooks and their vessels which huram who was as his father made for king solomon for the house of the lord were of polished brass
 the king made them of liquid metal in the lowland of jordan in the soft earth between succoth and zeredah
 so solomon made all these vessels a very great store of them and the weight of the brass used was not measured
 and solomon made all the vessels used in the house of god the gold altar and the tables on which the holy bread was placed
 and the supports for the lights with their lights to be burning in the regular way in front of the inmost room of the best gold
 the flowers and the vessels for the lights and the instruments used for them were all of gold it was the best gold
 the scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire trays of the best gold and the inner doors of the house opening into the most holy place and the doors of the temple were all of gold
 so all the work which solomon did for the house of the lord was complete and solomon took the holy things which david his father had given the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the store houses of the house of god
 then solomon sent for all the responsible men of israel all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of israel to come to jerusalem and take the ark of the lords agreement up out of the town of david which is zion
 and all the men of israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month
 all the responsible men of israel came and the levites took up the ark
 they took up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the tent all these the priests the levites took up
 and king solomon and all the men of israel who had come together there with him were before the ark making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered
 and the priests took the ark of the lords agreement and put it in its place in the inner room of the house in the most holy place under the wings of the winged ones
 for their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was covering the ark and its rods
 the rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place before the inmost room but they were not seen from outside and there they are to this day
 nothing was in the ark but the two flat stones which moses put there at horeb where the lord made an agreement with the children of israel when they came out of egypt
 now when the priests had come out of the holy place  for all the priests who were present had made themselves holy not keeping to their divisions
 and the levites who made the music all of them asaph heman jeduthun and their sons and brothers robed in fair linen were in their places with their brass and corded instruments at the east side of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests blowing horns 
 and when the players on horns and those who made melody in song with one voice were sounding the praise and glory of the lord with loud voices and with wind instruments and brass and corded instruments of music praising the lord and saying he is good his mercy is unchanging for ever then the house was full of the cloud of the glory of the lord
 so that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud for the house of god was full of the glory of the lord
 then solomon said o lord to the sun you have given the heaven for a living place but your living place was not seen by men
 so i have made for you a living place a house in which you may be for ever present
 then turning his face about the king gave a blessing to all the men of israel and they were all on their feet together
 and he said praise be to the lord the god of israel who himself gave his word to my father david and with his strong hand has made his word come true saying
 from the day when i took my people out of the land of egypt no town in all the tribes of israel has been marked out by me for the building of a house for the resting place of my name and i took no man to be a ruler over my people israel
 but now i have made selection of jerusalem that my name might be there and of david to be over my people israel
 now it was in the heart of my father david to put up a house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 but the lord said to david my father you did well to have in your heart the desire to make a house for my name
 but you yourself will not be the builder of the house but your son the offspring of your body he it is who will put up a house for my name
 and the lord has kept his word for i have taken my father davids place on the seat of the kingdom of israel as the lord gave his word and i have made the house for the name of the lord the god of israel
 and there i have put the ark in which is the agreement of the lord which he made with the people of israel
 then he took his place in front of the altar of the lord all the men of israel being present
  for solomon had made a brass stage five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high and had put it in the middle of the open space on this he took his place and went down on his knees before all the meeting of israel stretching out his hands to heaven 
 and he said o lord the god of israel there is no god like you in heaven or on earth keeping faith and mercy unchanging for your servants while they go in your ways with all their hearts
 for you have kept the word which you gave to your servant david my father with your mouth you said it and with your hand you have made it come true this day
 so now o lord the god of israel let your word to your servant david my father come true when you said you will never be without a man to take his place before me on the seat of the kingdom of israel if only your children give attention to their ways walking in my law as you have done before me
 so now o lord the god of israel make your word come true which you said to your servant david
 but is it truly possible that god may be housed with men on earth see heaven and the heaven of heavens are not wide enough to be your resting place how much less this house which i have made
 still let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant and to his prayer for grace o lord my god and give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you
 that your eyes may be open to this house day and night to this place of which you have said that you would put your name there to give ear to the prayer which your servant may make turning to this place
 and give ear to the prayers of your servant and of your people israel when they make their prayers turning to this place give ear from heaven your living place and hearing have mercy
 if a man does wrong to his neighbour and has to take an oath and comes before your altar to take his oath in this house
 then let your ear be open in heaven and be the judge of your servants giving punishment to the wrongdoer so that his sin may come on his head and by your decision keeping from evil him who has done no wrong
 and if your people israel are overcome in war because of their sin against you if they are turned to you again honouring your name making prayers and requesting your grace in this house
 then give ear from heaven and let the sin of your people israel have forgiveness and take them back again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers
 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because of their sin against you if they make prayers with their faces turned to this place honouring your name and turning away from their sin when you send trouble on them
 then give ear from heaven so that the sin of your servants and the sin of your people israel may have forgiveness when you make clear to them the good way in which they are to go and send rain on your land which you have given to your people for their heritage
 if there is no food in the land if there is disease if the fruits of the earth are damaged by heat or water locust or worm if their towns are shut in by their attackers whatever trouble or whatever disease there may be
 whatever prayer or request for your grace is made by any man or by all your people israel whatever his trouble may be whose hands are stretched out to this house
 then give ear from heaven your living place answering with forgiveness and give to every man whose secret heart is open to you the reward of all his ways  for you and you only have knowledge of the hearts of the children of men 
 so that they may give you worship walking in your ways as long as they are living in the land which you gave to our fathers
 and as for the man from a strange land who is not of your people israel but comes from a far country because of the glory of your name and your strong hand and your outstretched arm when he comes to make his prayer turning to this house
 then give ear from heaven your living place and give him his desire whatever it may be so that all the peoples of the earth may have knowledge of your name worshipping you as do your people israel and may see that this house which i have made is truly named by your name
 if your people go out to war against their attackers by whatever way you may send them if they make their prayers to you turning their faces to this town of yours and to this house which i have put up for your name
 then give ear from heaven to their prayer and their cry for grace and see right done to them
 if they do wrong against you  for no man is without sin  and you are angry with them and give them up into the power of those who are fighting against them so that they take them away prisoners to a land far off or near
 and if they take thought in the land where they are prisoners turning again to you crying out in prayer to you in that land and saying we are sinners we have done wrong we have done evil
 if with all their heart and soul they are turned again to you in the land where they are prisoners the land where they have been taken and make their prayers turning their eyes to their land which you gave to their fathers and to the town which you took for yourself and the house which i have made for your name
 then give ear from heaven your living place to their prayer and their cry and see right done to them answering with forgiveness your people who have done wrong against you
 now o my god may your eyes be open and your ears awake to the prayers made in this place
 up  now o lord god come back to your resting place you and the ark of your strength let your priests o lord god be clothed with salvation and let your saints be glad in what is good
 o lord god let him whom you have taken for yourself never be given up by you keep in mind your mercies to david your servant
 now when solomons prayers were ended fire came down from heaven burning up all the offerings and the house was full of the glory of the lord
 and the priests were not able to go into the house of the lord for the lords house was full of the glory of the lord
 and all the children of israel were looking on when the fire came down and the glory of the lord was on the house and they went down on their knees with their faces to the earth worshipping and praising the lord and saying he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 then the king and all the people made offerings before the lord
 king solomon made an offering of twenty two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people kept the feast of the opening of the house of god
 and the priests were in their places and the levites with their instruments of music for the lords song which david the king had made for the praise of the lord whose mercy is unchanging for ever when david gave praise by their hand and the priests were sounding horns before them and all israel were on their feet
 then solomon made holy the middle of the open square in front of the house of the lord offering the burned offerings there and the fat of the peace offerings for there was not room on the brass altar which solomon had made for all the burned offerings and the meal offerings and the fat
 so solomon kept the feast at that time for seven days and all israel with him a very great meeting for the people had come together from the way into hamath and from as far as the river of egypt
 and on the eighth day they had a holy meeting the offerings for making the altar holy went on for seven days and the feast for seven days
 and on the twenty third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents full of joy and glad in their hearts because of all the good which the lord had done to david and to solomon and to israel his people
 so solomon came to the end of building the house of the lord and the kings house and everything which it was in his mind to make in the house of the lord and for himself had been well done
 now the lord came to solomon in a vision by night and said to him i have given ear to your prayer and have taken this place for myself as a house where offerings are to be made
 if at my word heaven is shut up so that there is no rain or if i send locusts on the land for its destruction or if i send disease on my people
 if my people on whom my name is named make themselves low and come to me in prayer searching for me and turning from their evil ways then i will give ear from heaven overlooking their sin and will give life again to their land
 now my eyes will be open and my ears awake to the prayers made in this place
 for i have taken this house for myself and made it holy so that my name may be there for ever and my eyes and my heart will be there at all times
 and as for you if you will go on your way before me as david your father did doing whatever i have given you orders to do and keeping my laws and my decisions
 then i will make strong the seat of your kingdom as i gave my word to david your father saying you will never be without a man to be ruler in israel
 but if you are turned away from me and do not keep my orders and my laws which i have put before you but go and make yourselves servants to other gods giving them worship
 then i will have this people uprooted out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have made holy for my name i will put away from before my eyes and make it an example and a word of shame among all peoples
 and this house will become a mass of broken walls and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and will say why has the lord done so to this land and to this house
 and their answer will be because they were turned away from the lord the god of their fathers who took them out of the land of egypt and took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants that is why he has sent all this evil on them
 now at the end of twenty years in which time solomon had put up the house of the lord and a house for himself
 he took in hand the building up of the towns which huram had given him causing the children of israel to make living places for themselves there
 and solomon went to hamath zobah and overcame it
 and he put up the buildings of tadmor in the waste land and of all the store towns in hamath
 and of beth horon the higher and the lower walled towns with walls and doorways and locks
 and of baalath and all the store towns which solomon had and the towns where he kept his war carriages and his horse men and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land under his rule
 as for all the rest of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites who were not of israel
 their men who were still living in the land and whom the children of israel had not put an end to these solomon put to forced work as is done to this day
 but solomon did not make use of the children of israel as servants for his work they were men of war his chiefs and his captains and captains of his war carriages and his horsemen
 now these were the chief men in authority whom king solomon had two hundred and fifty of them in authority over the people
 then solomon made pharaohs daughter come up from the town of david to the house which he had made for her for he said i will not have my wife living in the house of david king of israel because those places where the ark of the lord has come are holy
 then solomon made burned offerings to the lord on the altar of the lord which he had put up in front of the covered way
 offering every day what had been ordered by moses on the sabbaths and at the new moon and at the regular feasts three times a year that is at the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tents
 and he gave the divisions of the priests their places for their work as ordered by his father david and to the levites he gave their work of praise and waiting on the priests to do what was needed day by day and he gave the door keepers their places in turn at every door for so david the man of god had given orders
 all the orders given by the king to the priests and levites in connection with any business or stores were done with care
 and all the work of solomon was complete from the day when he put the base of the lords house in position till solomon had come to the end of building the lords house
 then solomon went to ezion geber and to eloth by the sea in the land of edom
 and huram sent him by his servants ships and experienced seamen who went with the servants of solomon to ophir and came back with four hundred and fifty talents of gold which they took to king solomon
 now the queen of sheba hearing great things of solomon came to jerusalem to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions and with her came a very great train and camels weighted down with spices and great stores of gold and jewels and when she came to solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind
 and solomon gave her answers to all her questions there was no secret which he did not make clear to her
 and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house which he had made
 and the food at his table and all his servants seated there and those who were waiting on him in their places and their robes and his wine servants and their robes and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
 and she said to the king the account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true
 but i had no faith in what was said about you till i came and saw for myself and truly word was not given me of half your great wisdom you are much greater than they said
 happy are your wives and happy these your servants whose place is ever before you hearing your words of wisdom
 praise be to the lord your god whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of his kingdom to be king for the lord your god because in his love for israel it was the purpose of your god to make them strong for ever he made you king over them to be their judge in righteousness
 and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and a great store of spices and jewels never had such spices been seen as the queen of sheba gave to solomon
 and the servants of huram and the servants of solomon in addition to gold from ophir came back with sandal wood and jewels
 and with the sandal wood the king made steps for the house of the lord and for the kings house and instruments of music for the makers of melody never before had such been seen in the land of judah
 and king solomon gave the queen of sheba all her desire whatever she made request for in addition to what she had taken to the king so she went back to her country with her servants
 now the weight of gold which came to solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents
 and in addition to what he got from traders of different sorts all the kings of arabia and the rulers of the country gave gold and silver to solomon
 and king solomon made two hundred body covers of hammered gold every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it
 and he made three hundred smaller body covers of hammered gold using three hundred shekels of gold for every cover and the king put them in the house of the woods of lebanon
 then the king made a great ivory seat plated with the best gold
 there were six steps up to it and a foot rest of gold fixed to it and arms on the two sides of the seat with two lions at the side of the arms
 and twelve lions were placed on one side and on the other side on the six steps there was nothing like it in any kingdom
 all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the woods of lebanon were of the best gold no one gave a thought to silver in the days of solomon
 for the king had tarshish ships sailing with the servants of huram once every three years the tarshish ships came back with gold and silver ivory and monkeys and peacocks
 and king solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom
 and all the kings of the earth came to see solomon and to give ear to his wisdom which god had put into his heart
 and everyone took with him an offering vessels of silver and vessels of gold and robes and coats of metal and spices and horses and beasts for transport regularly year by year
 solomon had four thousand buildings for his horses and his war carriages and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept some in the carriage towns and some with the king in jerusalem
 and he was ruler over all the kings from the river to the land of the philistines as far as the limit of egypt
 the king made silver as common as stones in jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore trees of the lowlands in number
 they got horses for solomon from egypt and from every land
 now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not recorded in the history of nathan the prophet and in the words of ahijah the prophet of shiloh and in the visions of iddo the seer about jeroboam the son of nebat
 solomon was king over israel in jerusalem for forty years
 and solomon went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and rehoboam his son became king in his place
 after the death of ahab moab made itself free from the authority of israel
 now ahaziah had a fall from the window of his room in samaria and was ill and he sent men and said to them put a question to baal zebub the god of ekron about the outcome of my disease to see if i will get well or not
 but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite go now and meeting the men sent by the king of samaria say to them is it because there is no god in israel that you are going to get directions from baal zebub the god of ekron
 give ear then to the words of the lord you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you then elijah went away
 and the men he had sent came back to the king and he said to them why have you come back
 and they said to him on our way we had a meeting with a man who said go back to the king who sent you and say to him the lord says is it because there is no god in israel that you send to put a question to baal zebub the god of ekron for this reason you will not come down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you
 and he said to them what sort of a man was it who came and said these words to you
 and they said in answer he was a man clothed in a coat of hair with a leather band about his body then he said it is elijah the tishbite
 then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty men and he went up to him where he was seated on the top of a hill and said to him o man of god the king has said come down
 and elijah in answer said to the captain of fifty if i am a man of god may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men and put an end to you then fire came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men
 then the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty men and he said to elijah o man of god the king says come down quickly
 and elijah in answer said if i am a man of god may fire come down from heaven on you and on your fifty men and put an end to you and the fire of god came down from heaven and put an end to him and his fifty men
 then he sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty men and the third captain of fifty went up and falling on his knees before elijah requesting mercy of him said o man of god let my life and the life of these your fifty servants be of value to you
 for fire came down from heaven and put an end to the first two captains of fifty and their fifties but now let my life be of value in your eyes
 then the angel of the lord said to elijah go down with him have no fear of him so he got up and went down with him to the king
 and he said to him this is the word of the lord because you sent men to put a question to baal zebub the god of ekron for this reason you will never again get down from the bed on to which you have gone up but death will certainly come to you
 so death came to him as the lord had said by the mouth of elijah and jehoram became king in his place in the second year of the rule of jehoram son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son
 now the rest of the acts of ahaziah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 now there were in samaria seventy of ahabs sons and jehu sent letters to samaria to the rulers of the town and to the responsible men and to those who had the care of the sons of ahab saying
 straight away when you get this letter seeing that your masters sons are with you and that you have carriages and horses and a walled town and arms
 take the best and most upright of your masters sons and make him king in his fathers place and put up a fight for your masters family
 but they were full of fear and said the two kings have gone down before him how may we keep our place
 so the controller of the kings house with the ruler of the town and the responsible men and those who had the care of ahabs sons sent to jehu saying we are your servants and will do all your orders we will not make any man king do whatever seems best to you
 then he sent them a second letter saying if you are on my side and if you will do my orders come to me at jezreel by this time tomorrow with the heads of your masters sons now the kings seventy sons were with the great men of the town who had the care of them
 and when the letter came to them they took the kings sons and put them to death all the seventy and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at jezreel
 and a man came and said to him they have come with the heads of the kings sons and he said put them down in two masses at the doorway of the town till the morning
 and in the morning he went out and stopping said to all the people there you are upright men it is true that i made designs against my master and put him to death but who is responsible for the death of all these
 you may be certain that nothing which the lord has said about the family of ahab will be without effect for the lord has done what he said by his servant elijah
 so jehu put to death all the rest of the seed of ahab in jezreel and all his relations and his near friends and his priests till there were no more of them
 then he got up and came to samaria and he was at the meeting place of the keepers of sheep by the way
 when he came across the brothers of ahaziah king of judah and said who are you and they said we are the brothers of ahaziah king of judah we are going down to see the children of the king and of the queen
 and he said take them living so they took them living and put them to death in the water hole of beth eked of the forty two men he put every one to death
 and when he had gone away from there he came across jehonadab the son of rechab and he said good day to him and said to him is your heart true to mine as mine is to yours and jehonadab in answer said it is and jehu said if it is give me your hand and he gave him his hand and he made him come up into his carriage
 and he said come with me and see how i am on fire for the lords cause so he made him go with him in his carriage
 and when he came to samaria he put to death all those of ahabs family who were still in samaria till there were no more of them as the lord had said to elijah
 then jehu got all the people together and said to them ahab was baals servant in a small way but jehu will be his servant on a great scale
 now send for all the prophets of baal and all his servants and all his priests to come to me let no one keep away for i have a great offering to make to baal anyone who is not present will be put to death this jehu did with deceit his purpose being the destruction of the servants of baal
 and jehu said let there be a special holy meeting for the worship of baal so a public statement was made
 and jehu sent out through all israel and all the servants of baal came not one kept away and they came into the house of baal so that it was full from end to end
 and jehu said to him who kept the robes get out robes for all the servants of baal so he got out robes for them
 and jehu with jehonadab the son of rechab went into the house of baal and he said to the servants of baal make a search with care to see that no servant of the lord is with you but only servants of baal
 then they went in to make offerings and burned offerings now jehu had put eighty men outside and said to them if any man whom i give into your hands gets away the life of him who lets him go will be the price of his life
 then when the burned offering was ended straight away jehu said to the armed men and the captains go in and put them to death let not one come out so they put them to the sword and pulling the images to the earth they went into the holy place of the house of baal
 and they took out the image of asherah from the house of baal and had it burned
 the altar of baal was pulled down and the house of baal was broken up and made an unclean place as it is to this day
 so jehu put an end to the worship of baal in israel
 but jehu did not keep himself from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat and the evil he made israel do the gold oxen were still in beth el and in dan
 and the lord said to jehu because you have done well in doing what is right in my eyes and effecting all my purpose for the family of ahab your sons will be kings of israel to the fourth generation
 but jehu did not take care to keep the law of the lord with all his heart he did not keep himself from the sin which jeroboam did and made israel do
 in those days the lord was angry first with israel and hazael made attacks on all the land of israel
 east of jordan in all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer by the valley of the arnon all gilead and bashan
 now the rest of the acts of jehu and all he did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jehu went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria and jehoahaz his son became king in his place
 and the time of jehus rule over israel in samaria was twenty eight years
 now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom put to death
 but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah secretly took joash the son of ahaziah with the woman who took care of him away from among the kings sons who were put to death and put him in the bedroom and they kept him safe from athaliah so that he was not put to death
 and for six years she kept him safe in the house of the lord while athaliah was ruling over the land
 then in the seventh year jehoiada sent for the captains of hundreds of the carians and the armed men and taking them into the house of the lord made an agreement with them and made them take an oath in the house of the lord and let them see the kings son
 and he gave them orders saying this is what you are to do the third part of you who come in on the sabbath and keep the watch of the kings house
 
 and the two divisions of you who go out on the sabbath and keep the watch of the house of the lord
 will make a circle round the king every man being armed and whoever comes inside your lines is to be put to death keep with the king when he goes out and when he comes in
 and the captains of hundreds did as jehoiada the priest gave them orders every one took with him his men those who came in and those who went out on the sabbath and they came in to jehoiada the priest
 and the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body covers which had been king davids and which were kept in the house of the lord
 then the armed men took up their positions every man with his instruments of war in his hand from the right side of the house to the left round about the altar and the house
 then he made the kings son come out and put the crown on him and the arm bands and made him king and put the holy oil on him and they all making sounds of joy with their hands said long life to the king
 now athaliah hearing the noise made by the people came to the people in the house of the lord
 and looking she saw the king in his regular place by the pillar and the captains and the horns near him and all the people of the land giving signs of joy and sounding the horns then athaliah violently parting her robes gave a cry saying broken faith broken faith 
 then jehoiada the priest gave orders to those who were placed in authority over the army saying take her outside the lines and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword for he said let her not be put to death in the house of the lord
 so they put their hands on her and she went to the kings house by the doorway of the horses and there she was put to death
 and jehoiada made an agreement between the lord and the king and the people that they would be the lords people and in the same way between the king and the people
 then all the people of the land went to the house of baal and had it pulled down its altars and images were all broken to bits and mattan the priest of baal they put to death before the altars and the priest put overseers over the lords house
 then he took the captains of hundreds and the carians and the armed men and all the people of the land and they came down with the king from the house of the lord through the doorway of the armed men to the kings house and he took his place on the seat of the kings
 so all the people of the land were glad and the town was quiet and they had put athaliah to death with the sword at the kings house
 and jehoash was seven years old when he became king
 in the seventh year of jehus rule jehoash became king and he was ruling for forty years in jerusalem his mothers name was zibiah of beer sheba
 jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the lord all his days because he was guided by the teaching of jehoiada the priest
 but the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
 and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the holy things which comes into the house of the lord  the amount fixed for every mans payment  and all the money given by any man freely from the impulse of his heart
 let the priests take every man from his friends and neighbours to make good what is damaged in the house wherever it is to be seen
 but in the twenty third year of king jehoash the priests had not made good the damaged parts of the house
 then king jehoash sent for jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them why have you not made good what is damaged in the house now take no more money from your neighbours but give it for the building up of the house
 so the priests made an agreement to take no more money from the people and not to make good what was damaged in the house
 but jehoiada the priest took a chest and making a hole in the cover of it put it by the altar on the right side when one comes into the house of the lord and the priests who kept the door put in it regularly all the money which was taken into the house of the lord
 and when they saw that there was much money in the chest the kings scribe and the high priest came and put it in bags noting the amount of all the money there was in the house of the lord
 and the money which was measured out they gave regularly to those who were responsible for overseeing the work and these gave it in payment to the woodworkers and the builders who were working on the house of the lord
 and to the wall builders and the stone cutters and to get wood and cut stone for building up the broken parts of the house of the lord and for everything needed to put the house in good order
 but the money was not used for making silver cups or scissors or basins or wind instruments or any vessels of gold or silver for the house of the lord
 but it was all given to the workmen who were building up the house
 and they did not get any statement of accounts from the men to whom the money was given for the workmen for they made use of it with good faith
 the money of the offerings for error and the sin offerings was not taken into the house of the lord it was the priests
 then hazael king of aram went up against gath and took it and his purpose was to go up to jerusalem
 then jehoash king of judah took all the holy things which jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers the kings of judah had given to the lord together with the things he himself had given and all the gold in the temple store and in the kings house and sent it to hazael king of aram and he went away from jerusalem
 now the rest of the acts of joash and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and his servants made a secret design and put joash to death at the house of millo on the way down to silla
 and jozacar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants came to him and put him to death and they put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of david and amaziah his son became king in his place
 in the twenty third year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu became king over israel in samaria ruling for seventeen years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which he did and made israel do he did not keep himself from them
 so the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the power of hazael king of aram and into the power of ben hadad the son of hazael again and again
 then jehoahaz made prayer to the lord and the lord gave ear to him for he saw how cruelly israel was crushed by the king of aram
  and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they became free from the hands of the aramaeans and the children of israel were living in their tents as in the past
 but still they did not give up the sin of jeroboam which he made israel do but went on with it and there was an image of asherah in samaria 
 for out of all his army jehoahaz had only fifty horsemen and ten carriages and ten thousand footmen the king of aram had given them up to destruction crushing them like dust
 now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all he did and his great power are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jehoahaz went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria and joash his son became king in his place
 in the thirty seventh year of the rule of joash king of judah joash the son of jehoahaz became king over israel in samaria ruling for sixteen years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord not turning away from the sin of jeroboam the son of nebat which he did and made israel do but he went on with it
 now the rest of the acts of joash and all he did and the force with which he went to war against amaziah king of judah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and joash went to rest with his fathers and jeroboam took his place as king and joash was put into the earth in samaria with the kings of israel
 now elisha became ill with the disease which was the cause of his death and joash king of israel came down to him and weeping over him said my father my father the war carriages of israel and its horsemen 
 then elisha said to him take bow and arrows and he took bow and arrows
 and he said to the king of israel put your hand on the bow and he put his hand on it and elisha put his hands on the kings hands
 then he said let the window be open to the east and he got it open then elisha said let the arrow go and he let it go and he said the lords arrow of salvation of salvation over aram for you will overcome the aramaeans in aphek and put an end to them
 and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said to the king of israel send them down into the earth and he did so three times and no more
 then the man of god was angry with him and said if you had done it five or six times then you would have overcome aram completely but now you will only overcome them three times
 and death came to elisha and they put his body into the earth now in the spring of the year armed bands of moabites frequently came overrunning the land
 and while they were putting a dead man into the earth they saw a band coming and they put the man quickly into the place where elishas body was and the dead man on touching elishas bones came to life again and got up on his feet
 and israel was crushed under the power of hazael king of aram all the days of jehoahaz
 but the lord was kind to them and had pity on them caring for them because of his agreement with abraham isaac and jacob he would not put them to destruction or send them away from before his face till now
 then hazael king of aram came to his end and ben hadad his son became king in his place
 and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again from ben hadad the son of hazael the towns which he had taken from jehoahaz his father in war three times jehoash overcame him and got back the towns of israel
 in the second year of joash son of joahaz king of israel amaziah the son of joash became king of judah
 he was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for twenty nine years his mothers name was jehoaddin of jerusalem
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord though not like david his father he did as joash his father had done
 but still the high places were not taken away the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
 now when he became strong in the kingdom straight away he put to death those servants who had taken the life of the king his father
 but he did not put their children to death for the orders of the lord recorded in the book of the law of moses say the fathers are not to be put to death for the children or the children for their fathers but a man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
 he put to the sword twelve thousand men of edom in the valley of salt and took sela in war naming it joktheel as it is to this day
 then amaziah sent representatives to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son of jehu king of israel saying come let us have a meeting face to face
 and jehoash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thorn tree in lebanon sent to the cedar in lebanon saying give your daughter to my son for a wife and a beast from the woodland in lebanon went by crushing the thorn under his feet
 it is true that you have overcome edom and your heart is uplifted let that glory be enough for you and keep in your country why do you make causes of trouble putting yourself and judah with you in danger of downfall
 but amaziah gave no attention so jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah came face to face at beth shemesh which is in judah
 and judah was overcome before israel so that they went in flight every man to his tent
 and jehoash king of israel made amaziah king of judah the son of jehoash son of ahaziah prisoner at beth shemesh and came to jerusalem and had the wall of jerusalem pulled down from the doorway of ephraim to the door in the angle four hundred cubits
 and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels which were in the house of the lord and in the store house of the king together with those whose lives would be the price of broken faith and went back to samaria
 now the rest of the acts of jehoash and his power and how he went to war with amaziah king of judah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jehoash went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in samaria with the kings of israel and jeroboam his son became king in his place
 amaziah the son of joash king of judah went on living for fifteen years after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel
 and the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 now they made a secret design against him in jerusalem and he went in flight to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and put him to death there
 and they took his body on horseback and put it into the earth with his fathers in jerusalem the town of david
 then all the people of judah took azariah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father amaziah
 he was the builder of elath which he got back for judah after the death of the king
 in the fifteenth year of the rule of amaziah son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel became king in samaria ruling for forty one years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord not turning away from the sin which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do
 he got back the old limits of israel from the way into hamath to the sea of the arabah as the lord had said by his servant jonah the son of amittai the prophet of gath hepher
 for the lord saw how bitter was the trouble of israel and that everyone was cut off he who was shut up and he who went free and that israel had no helper
 and the lord had not said that the name of israel was to be taken away from the earth but he gave them a saviour in jeroboam the son of joash
 now the rest of the acts of jeroboam and all he did and his power and how he went to war with damascus causing the wrath of the lord to be turned away from israel are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and jeroboam went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with the kings of israel and zechariah his son became king in his place
 in the twenty seventh year of the rule of jeroboam king of israel azariah son of amaziah became king of judah
 he was sixteen years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for fifty two years his mothers name was jecoliah of jerusalem
 and he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father amaziah had done
 but he did not take away the high places and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places
 and the lord sent disease on the king and he became a leper and to the day of his death he was living separately in his private house and jotham his son was over his house judging the people of the land
 now the rest of the acts of azariah and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and azariah went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of david and jotham his son became king in his place
 in the thirty eighth year of azaliah king of judah zechariah son of jeroboam was king over israel for six months
 and he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his father had done not turning away from the sin which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do
 and shallum the son of jabesh made a secret design against him and attacking him in ibleam put him to death and became king in his place
 now the rest of the acts of zechariah are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 this was what the lord had said to jehu your sons to the fourth generation will be kings of israel and so it came about
 shallum the son of jabesh became king in the thirty ninth year of uzziah king of judah and he was ruling in samaria for the space of one month
 then menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah and came to samaria and attacking shallum son of jabesh in samaria put him to death and made himself king in his place
 now the rest of the acts of shallum and the secret design which he made are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 then menahem sent destruction on tappuah and all the people in it and its limits from tirzah because they would not let him come in and he had all the women who were with child cut open
 in the thirty ninth year of azariah king of judah menahem the son of gadi became king over israel and was ruling in samaria for ten years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord he did not keep himself from the sin which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do
 in his day pul the king of assyria came up against the land and menahem gave pul a thousand talents of silver so that he might let him keep the kingdom
 and menahem got the money from israel from all the men of wealth fifty silver shekels from every man to give to the king of assyria so the king of assyria went back without stopping in the land
 now the rest of the acts of menahem and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 and menahem went to rest with his fathers and pekahiah his son became king in his place
 in the fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekahiah the son of menahem became king over israel in samaria ruling for two years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord not turning from the sin which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do
 and pekah the son of remaliah his captain made a secret design against him attacking him in the kings great house in samaria and with him were fifty men of gilead and he put him to death and became king in his place
 now the rest of the acts of pekahiah and all he did are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 in the fifty second year of azariah king of judah pekah the son of remaliah became king over israel in samaria ruling for twenty years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord not turning from the sin which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do
 in the days of pekah king of israel tiglath pileser king of assyria came and took ijon and abel beth maacah and janoah and kedesh and hazor and gilead and galilee and all the land of naphtali and he took the people away to assyria
 and hoshea the son of elah made a secret design against pekah the son of remaliah and attacking him put him to death and became king in his place in the twentieth year of jotham the son of uzziah
 now the rest of the acts of pekah and all he did are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of israel
 in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel jotham the son of uzziah became king of judah
 he was twenty five years old when he became king and he was ruling for sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerusha the daughter of zadok
 and he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father uzziah had done
 but he did not take away the high places and the people still went on making offerings and burning them in the high places he was the builder of the higher doorway of the house of the lord
 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 in those days the lord first sent against judah rezin the king of aram and pekah the son of remaliah
 and jotham went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the town of david his father and ahaz his son became king in his place
 in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham became king of judah
 ahaz was twenty years old when he became king he was ruling for sixteen years in jerusalem he did not do what was right in the eyes of the lord his god as david his father did
 but he went in the ways of the kings of israel and even made his son go through the fire copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the lord had sent out of the land before the children of israel
 and he made offerings burning them in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
 then rezin king of aram and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to make war and they made an attack on ahaz shutting him in but were not able to overcome him
 at that time the king of edom got elath back for edom and sent the jews out of elath and the edomites came back to elath where they are living to this day
 so ahaz sent representatives to tiglath pileser king of assyria saying i am your servant and your son come to my help against the kings of aram and israel who have taken up arms against me
 and ahaz took the silver and gold which were in the house of the lord and in the kings store house and sent them as an offering to the king of assyria
 and the king of assyria in answer to his request went up against damascus and took it and took its people away as prisoners to kir and put rezin to death
 then king ahaz went to damascus for a meeting with tiglath pileser king of assyria and there he saw the altar which was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest a copy of the altar giving the design of it and all the details of its structure
 and from the copy king ahaz sent from damascus urijah made an altar and had it ready by the time king ahaz came back from damascus
 and when the king came from damascus he saw the altar and he went up on it and made an offering on it
 he made his burned offering and his meal offering and his drink offering there draining out the blood of his peace offerings on the altar
 and the brass altar which was before the lord he took from the front of the house from between his altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of his altar
 and king ahaz gave orders to urijah the priest saying make the morning burned offering and the evening meal offering and the kings burned offering and meal offering with the burned offerings of all the people and their meal offerings and drink offerings on the great altar and put on it all the blood of the burned offerings and of the beasts which are offered but the brass altar will be for my use to get directions from the lord
 so urijah the priest did everything as the king said
 and king ahaz took off the sides of the wheeled bases and took down the great water vessel from off the brass oxen which were under it and put it on a floor of stone
 *** the house of the lord because of the king of assyria
 now the rest of the things which ahaz did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and ahaz went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of david and hezekiah his son became king in his place
 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah hoshea the son of elah became king over israel in samaria ruling for nine years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord though not like the kings of israel before him
 against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and sent him offerings
 but hosheas broken faith became clear to the king of assyria because he had sent representatives to so king of egypt and did not send his offering to the king of assyria as he had done year by year so the king of assyria had him shut up in prison and put in chains
 then the king of assyria went through all the land and came up to samaria shutting it in with his forces for three years
 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and took israel away to assyria placing them in halah and in habor on the river gozan and in the towns of the medes
 and the wrath of the lord came on israel because they had done evil against the lord their god who took them out of the land of egypt from under the yoke of pharaoh king of egypt and had become worshippers of other gods
 living by the rules of the nations whom the lord had sent out from before the children of israel
 and the children of israel did secretly against the lord their god things which were not right building high places for themselves in all their towns from the tower of the watchmen to the walled town
 they put up pillars of stone and wood on every high hill and under every green tree
 burning their offerings in all the high places as those nations did whom the lord sent away from before them they did evil things moving the lord to wrath
 and they made themselves servants of disgusting things though the lord had said you are not to do this
 and he gave witness to israel and judah by every prophet and seer saying come back from your evil ways and do my orders and keep my rules and be guided by the law which i gave to your fathers and sent to you by my servants the prophets
 and they did not give ear but became stiff necked like their fathers who had no faith in the lord their god
 and they went against his rules and the agreement which he made with their fathers and his laws which he gave them they gave themselves up to things without sense or value and became foolish like the nations round them of whom the lord had said do not as they do
 and turning their backs on all the orders which the lord had given them they made for themselves images of metal and the image of asherah worshipping all the stars of heaven and becoming servants to baal
 and they made their sons and their daughters go through the fire and they made use of secret arts and unnatural powers and gave themselves up to doing evil in the eyes of the lord till he was moved to wrath
 so the lord was very angry with israel and his face was turned away from them only the tribe of judah kept its place
  but even judah did not keep the orders of the lord their god but were guided by the rules which israel had made
 so the lord would have nothing to do with all the offspring of israel and sent trouble on them and gave them up into the hands of their attackers till he had sent them away from before his face 
 for israel was broken off from the family of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king who driving them away from the laws of the lord made them do a great sin
 and the children of israel went on with all the sins which jeroboam did they did not keep themselves from them
 till the lord put israel away from before his face as he had said by all his servants the prophets so israel was taken away from their land to assyria to this day
 then the king of assyria took men from babylon and from cuthah and avva and hamath and sepharvaim and put them in the towns of samaria in place of the children of israel so they got samaria for their heritage living in its towns
 now when first they were living there they did not give worship to the lord so the lord sent lions among them causing the death of some of them
 so they said to the king of assyria the nations whom you have taken as prisoners and put in the towns of samaria have no knowledge of the way of the god of the land so he has sent lions among them causing their death because they have no knowledge of his way
 then the king of assyria gave orders saying send there one of the priests whom you took away and let him be living there and teaching the people the way of the god of the land
 so one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from samaria came back and living in beth el became their teacher in the worship of the lord
 and every nation made gods for themselves and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in the towns where they were living
 the men of babylon made succoth benoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima
 the avvites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim
 so they went on worshipping the lord and made for themselves from among all the people priests for the high places to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places
 they gave worship to the lord but they gave honour to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners
 so to this day they go on in their old ways not worshipping the lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the lord gave to the children of jacob to whom he gave the name israel
 and the lord made an agreement with them and gave them orders saying you are to have no other gods you are not to give worship to them or be their servants or make them offerings
 but the lord who took you out of the land of egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm he is your god to whom you are to give worship and make offerings
 and the rules and the orders and the law which he put in writing for you you are to keep and do for ever you are to have no other gods
 and you are to keep in memory the agreement which i have made with you and you are to have no other gods
 and you are to give worship to the lord your god for it is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you
 but they gave no attention but went on in their old way
 so these nations worshipping the lord still were servants to the images they had made their children and their childrens children did the same as their fathers did so do they to this day
 now in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel hezekiah the son of ahaz became king of judah
 he was twenty five years old when he became king ruling in jerusalem for twenty nine years his mothers name was abi the daughter of zechariah
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord as david his father had done
 he had the high places taken away and the stone pillars broken to bits and the asherah cut down and the brass snake which moses had made was crushed to powder at his order because in those days the children of israel had offerings burned before it and he gave it the name nehushtan
 he had faith in the lord the god of israel so that there was no one like him among all the kings of judah who were before him
 for his heart was fixed on the lord not turning from his ways and he did his orders which the lord gave to moses
 and the lord was with him he did well in all his undertakings and he took up arms against the king of assyria and was his servant no longer
 he overcame the philistines as far as gaza and its limits from the tower of the watchman to the walled town
 now in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria shutting it in with his armies
 and at the end of three years they took it in the sixth year of hezekiahs rule which was the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken
 and the king of assyria took israel away as prisoners into assyria placing them in halah and in habor on the river gozan and in the towns of the medes
 because they did not give ear to the voice of the lord their god but went against his agreement even against everything ordered by moses the servant of the lord and they did not give ear to it or do it
 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the walled towns of judah and took them
 and hezekiah king of judah sent to lachish to the king of assyria saying i have done wrong give up attacking me and whatever you put on me i will undergo and the payment he was to make was fixed by the king of assyria at three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold
 so hezekiah gave him all the silver in the house of the lord and in the kings store house
 and at that time hezekiah had the gold from the doors of the lords house and from the door pillars plated by him cut off and gave it to the king of assyria
 then the king of assyria sent the tartan and the rab saris and the rab shakeh from lachish to jerusalem to king hezekiah with a strong force and they went up and came to jerusalem and took up their position by the stream of the higher pool by the highway of the washermans field
 and they sent for the king and eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder came out to them
 and the rab shakeh said to them say now to hezekiah these are the words of the great king the king of assyria in what are you placing your hope
 you say you have a design and strength for war but these are only words now to whom are you looking for support that you have gone against my authority
 see now you are basing your hope on that broken rod of egypt which will go through a mans hand if he makes use of it for a support for so is pharaoh king of egypt to all who put their faith in him
 and if you say to me our hope is in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and altars hezekiah has taken away saying to judah and jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar in jerusalem
 and now take a chance with my master the king of assyria and i will give you two thousand horses if you are able to put horsemen on them
 how then may you put to shame the least of my masters servants and you have put your hope in egypt for war carriages and horsemen
 and have i now come up to send destruction on this place without the lords authority it was the lord himself who said to me go up against this land and make it waste
 then eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah said to the rab shakeh will you kindly make use of the aramaean language in talking to your servants for we are used to it and do not make use of the jews language in the hearing of the people on the wall
 but the rab shakeh said to them is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in
 then the rab shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the jews language give ear to the words of the great king the king of assyria
 this is what the king says do not be tricked by hezekiah for there is no salvation for you in him
 and do not let hezekiah make you put your faith in the lord saying the lord will certainly keep us safe and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 do not give ear to hezekiah for this is what the king of assyria says make peace with me and come out to me and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig tree and the water of his spring
 till i come and take you away to a land like yours a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vine gardens a land of oil giving olives and of honey so that life and not death may be your fate give no attention to hezekiah when he says to you the lord will keep us safe
 has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of assyria
 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah have they kept samaria out of my hands
 who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hands to give cause for the thought that the lord will keep jerusalem from falling into my hands
 but the people kept quiet and gave him no answer for the kings order was give him no answer
 then eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder came to hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief and gave him an account of what the rab shakeh had said
 and on hearing it king hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the lord
 and he sent eliakim who was over the house and shebna the scribe and the chief priests dressed in haircloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
 and they said to him hezekiah says this day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame for the children are ready to come to birth but there is no strength to give birth to them
 it may be that the lord your god will give ear to the words of the rab shakeh whom the king of assyria his master sent to say evil things against the living god and will make his words come to nothing so then make your prayer for the rest of the people
 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
 and isaiah said to them this is what you are to say to your master the lord says be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of assyria have said against me in your hearing
 see i will put a spirit into him and bad news will come to his ears and he will go back to his land and there i will have him put to death by the sword
 so the rab shakeh went back and when he got there the king of assyria was making war against libnah for it had come to his ears that he had gone away from lachish
 and when news came to him that tirhakah king of ethiopia had made an attack on him he sent representatives to hezekiah again saying
 this is what you are to say to hezekiah king of judah let not your god in whom is your faith give you a false hope saying jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 no doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of assyria have done to all lands putting them to the curse and will you be kept safe
 did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden who were in telassar
 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the town of sepharvaim of hena and of ivvah
 and hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it and after reading it hezekiah went up to the house of the lord opening the letter there before the lord
 and hezekiah made his prayer to the lord saying o lord the god of israel seated between the winged ones you only are the god of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
 let your ear be turned to us o lord and let your eyes be open o lord and see take note of all the words of sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living god
 truly o lord the kings of assyria have made waste the nations and their lands
 and have given their gods to the fire for they were no gods but wood and stone the work of mens hands so they have given them to destruction
 but now o lord our god give us salvation from his hands so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and only you o lord are god
 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying the lord the god of israel says the prayer which you have made to me against sennacherib king of assyria has come to my ears
 this is the word which the lord has said about him in the eyes of the virgin daughter of zion you are shamed and laughed at the daughter of jerusalem has made sport of you
 against whom have you said evil and bitter things against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up even against the holy one of israel
 you have sent your servants with evil words against the lord and have said with all my war carriages i have come up to the top of the mountains to the inmost parts of lebanon its tall cedars will be cut down and the best trees of its woods i will come up into his highest places into his thick woods
 i have made water holes and taken their waters and with my foot i have made all the rivers of egypt dry
 has it not come to your ears how i did it long before purposing it in times long past now i have given effect to my design so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls
 this is why their townsmen had no power they were broken and put to shame they were like the grass of the field and the green plant like grass on the house tops
 but i have knowledge of your getting up and your resting of your going out and your coming in
 because your wrath against me and your words of pride have come up to my ears i will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips and i will make you go back by the way you came
 and this will be the sign to you you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself and in the second year from the produce of the same and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vine gardens and take of their fruit
 and those of judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit
 for from jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out and those who are still living will go out of mount zion by the fixed purpose of the lord of armies this will be done
 for this cause the lord says about the king of assyria he will not come into this town or send an arrow against it he will not come before it with arms or put up an earthwork against it
 by the way he came he will go back and he will not get into this town says the lord
 for i will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant david
 and that night the angel of the lord went out and put to death in the army of the assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand men and when the people got up early in the morning there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies
 so sennacherib king of assyria went back to his place at nineveh
 and it came about when he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that his sons adrammelech and sharezer put him to death with the sword and they went in flight into the land of ararat and esar haddon his son became king in his place
 now when the lord was about to take elijah up to heaven in a great wind elijah went with elisha from gilgal
 and elijah said to elisha come no farther for the lord has sent me to beth el but elisha said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not be parted from you so they went down to beth el
 and at beth el the sons of the prophets came out to elisha and said has it been made clear to you that the lord is going to take away your master from over you today and he said yes i have knowledge of it say no more
 then elijah said to him come no farther for the lord has sent me to jericho but he said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not be parted from you so they went on to jericho
 and at jericho the sons of the prophets came up to elisha and said to him has it been made clear to you that the lord is going to take away your master from over you today and he said in answer yes i have knowledge of it say no more
 then elijah said to him come no farther for the lord has sent me to jordan but he said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not be parted from you so they went on together
 and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went out and took their places facing them a long way off while the two of them were by the edge of jordan
 then elijah took off his robe and rolling it up gave the water a blow with it and the waters were parted flowing back this way and that so that they went over on dry land
 and when they had come to the other side elijah said to elisha say what you would have me do for you before i am taken from you and elisha said be pleased to let a special measure of your spirit be on me
 and he said you have made a hard request still if you see me when i am taken from you you will get your desire but if not it will not be so
 and while they went on their way going on talking together suddenly there were carriages and horses of fire separating them from one another and elijah went up to heaven in a great wind
 and when elisha saw it he gave a cry my father my father the carriages of israel and its horsemen  and he saw him no longer and he was full of grief
 then he took up elijahs robe which had been dropped from him and went back till he came to the edge of jordan
 and he took elijahs robe which had been dropped from him and giving the water a blow with it said where is the lord the god of elijah and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that and elisha went over
 and when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah is resting on elisha and they came out to him and went down on the earth before him
 and they said your servants have with us here fifty strong men be pleased to let them go in search of elijah for it may be that the spirit of the lord has taken him up and put him down on some mountain or in some valley but he said do not send them
 but when they kept on requesting him he was shamed and said send then so they sent fifty men but after searching for three days they came back without having seen him
 and they came back to him while he was still at jericho and he said to them did i not say to you go not
 now the men of the town said to elisha you see that the position of this town is good but the water is bad causing the young of the cattle to come to birth dead
 so he said get me a new vessel and put salt in it and they took it to him
 then he went out to the spring from which the water came and put salt in it and said the lord says now i have made this water sweet no longer will it be death giving or unfertile
 and the water was made sweet again to this day as elisha said
 then from there he went up to beth el and on his way some little boys came out from the town and made sport of him crying go up old no hair  go up old no hair 
 and turning back he saw them and put a curse on them in the name of the lord and two she bears came out of the wood and put forty two of the children to death
 from there he went to mount carmel and came back from there to samaria
 in those days hezekiah was ill and near death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said to him the lord says put your house in order for your death is near
 then turning his face to the wall he made his prayer to the lord saying
 o lord keep in mind how i have been true to you with all my heart and have done what is good in your eyes and hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping
 now before isaiah had gone out of the middle of the town the word of the lord came to him saying
 go back and say to hezekiah the ruler of my people the lord the god of david your father says your prayer has come to my ears and i have seen your weeping see i will make you well on the third day you will go up to the house of the lord
 i will give you fifteen more years of life and i will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of assyria i will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant david
 then isaiah said take a cake of figs so they took it and put it on his wound and he got better
 and hezekiah said to isaiah what is to be the sign that the lord will make me well and that i will go up to the house of the lord on the third day
 and isaiah said this is the sign the lord will give you that he will do what he has said will the shade go forward ten degrees or back
 and hezekiah said in answer it is a simple thing for the shade to go forward but let it go back ten degrees
 then isaiah the prophet made prayer to the lord and he made the shade go back ten degrees from its position on the steps of ahaz
 at that time merodach baladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters with an offering to hezekiah because he had news that hezekiah had been ill
 and hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil of great price and the house of his arms and everything there was in his stores there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which hezekiah did not let them see
 then isaiah the prophet came to king hezekiah and said to him what did these men say and where did they come from and hezekiah said they came from a far country even from babylon
 and he said what have they seen in your house and hezekiah said in answer they saw everything in my house there is nothing among my stores which i did not let them see
 and isaiah said to hezekiah give ear to the word of the lord
 truly days are coming when everything in your house and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day will be taken away to babylon all will be gone says the lord
 and your sons the offspring of your body they will take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of babylon
 then hezekiah said to isaiah good is the word of the lord which you have said then he said  if in my time there is peace and righteousness
 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his power and how he made the pool and the stream to take water into the town are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and hezekiah went to rest with his fathers and manasseh his son became king in his place
 manasseh was twelve years old when he became king for fifty five years he was ruling in jerusalem and his mothers name was hephzi bah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord copying the disgusting ways of those nations whom the lord had sent out before the children of israel
 he put up again the high places which had been pulled down by hezekiah his father he made altars for baal and an asherah as ahab king of israel had done he was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven
 and he put up altars in the house of the lord of which the lord had said in jerusalem will i put my name
 and he put up altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer squares of the house of the lord
 and he made his son go through the fire and made use of secret arts and signs for reading the future he gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder workers he did much evil in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath
 he put the image of asherah which he had made in the house of which the lord had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem the town which i have made mine out of all the tribes of israel i will put my name for ever
 and never again will i send the feet of israel wandering from the land which i gave to their fathers if only they will take care to do all my orders and keep all the law which my servant moses gave them
 but they did not give ear and manasseh made them do more evil than those nations did whom the lord gave up to destruction before the children of israel
 and the lord said by his servants the prophets
 because manasseh king of judah has done these disgusting things doing more evil than all the amorites before him and making judah do evil with his false gods
 for this cause says the lord the god of israel i will send such evil on jerusalem and judah that the ears of all to whom the news comes will be burning
 and over jerusalem will be stretched the line of samaria and the weight of ahab jerusalem will be washed clean as a plate is washed and turned over on its face
 and i will put away from me the rest of my heritage and give them up into the hands of their haters who will take their property and their goods for themselves
 because they have done evil in my eyes moving me to wrath from the day when their fathers came out of egypt till this day
 more than this manasseh took the lives of upright men till jerusalem from one end to the other was full of blood in addition to his sin in making judah do evil in the eyes of the lord
 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all he did and his sins are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 so manasseh went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth in the garden of his house in the garden of uzza and amon his son became king in his place
 amon was twenty two years old when he became king ruling in jerusalem for two years his mothers name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as manasseh his father had done
 he went in all the ways of his father being a servant and worshipper of the false gods to which his father had been a servant
 turning away from the lord the god of his fathers and not walking in his ways
 and the servants of amon made a secret design against him and put the king to death in his house
 but the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against the king and made josiah his son king in his place
 now the rest of the acts which amon did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 he was put in his last resting place in the garden of uzza and josiah his son became king in his place
 josiah was eight years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for thirty one years his mothers name was jedidah daughter of adaiah of bozkath
 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord walking in the ways of david his father without turning to the right hand or to the left
 now in the eighteenth year after he became king josiah sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying to him
 go up to hilkiah the chief priest and let him give out the money which is taken into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have got together from the people
 and let it be given to the overseers of the work of the lords house to give to the workmen who are making good what was damaged in the house of the lord
 to the woodworkers and the builders and the stone cutters and for getting wood and cut stones for the building up of the house
 they did not have to give any account of the money which was handed to them for they made use of it with good faith
 then hilkiah the chief priest said to shaphan the scribe i have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the lord so hilkiah gave it to shaphan
 then after reading it shaphan the scribe went in to the king and gave him an account of what had been done saying your servants have given out the money which was in the house and have given it to the overseers of the work of the house of the lord
 then shaphan the scribe said to the king hilkiah the priest has given me a book and he was reading it before the king
 and the king hearing the words of the book of the law took his robe in his hands violently parting it as a sign of his grief
 and he gave orders to hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of micaiah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying
 go and get directions from the lord for me and for the people and for all judah about the words of this book which has come to light for great is the wrath of the lord which is burning against us because our fathers have not given ear to the words of this book to do all the things which are recorded in it
 so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asaiah went to huldah the woman prophet the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the robes  now she was living in jerusalem in the second part of the town  and they had talk with her
 and she said to them the lord the god of israel says say to the man who sent you to me
 these are the words of the lord see i will send evil on this place and on its people even everything which the king of judah has been reading in the book
 because they have given me up burning offerings to other gods and moving me to wrath by all the work of their hands so my wrath will be on fire against this place and will not be put out
 but to the king of judah who sent you to get directions from the lord say this is what the lord the god of israel has said as to the words which have come to your ears
 because your heart was soft and you made yourself low before me when you had word of what i said against this place and its people that they would become a waste and a curse and you gave signs of grief weeping before me truly i have given ear to you says the lord
 for this cause i will let you go to your fathers and be put in your last resting place in peace and your eyes will not see all the evil which i will send on this place so they took this news back to the king
 then the king sent and got together all the responsible men of judah and of jerusalem
 and the king went up to the house of the lord with all the men of judah and all the people of jerusalem and the priests and the prophets and all the people small and great and they were present at his reading of the book of the law which had come to light in the house of the lord
 and the king took his place by the pillar and made an agreement before the lord to go in the way of the lord and keep his orders and his decisions and his rules with all his heart and all his soul and to keep the words of the agreement recorded in the book and all the people gave their word to keep the agreement
 then the king gave orders to hilkiah the chief priest and to the priests of the second order and to the keepers of the door to take out of the house of the lord all the vessels made for baal and for the asherah and for all the stars of heaven and he had them burned outside jerusalem in the fields of kidron and took the dust of them to beth el
 and he put an end to the false priests who had been put in their positions by the kings of judah to see to the burning of offerings in the high places in the towns of judah and the outskirts of jerusalem and all those who made offerings to baal and to the sun and the moon and the twelve signs and all the stars of heaven
 and he took the asherah from the house of the lord outside jerusalem to the stream kidron burning it by the stream and crushing it to dust and he put the dust on the place where the bodies of the common people were put to rest
 and he had the houses pulled down of those who were used for sex purposes in the house of the lord where women were making robes for the asherah
 and he made all the priests from the towns of judah come into jerusalem and he made unclean the high places where the priests had been burning offerings from geba to beer sheba and he had the high places of the evil spirits pulled down which were by the doorway of joshua the ruler of the town on the left side of the way into the town
 still the priests of the high places never came up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem but they took their food of unleavened bread among their brothers
 and topheth in the valley of the sons of hinnom he made unclean so that no man might make his son or his daughter go through the fire to molech
 and he took away the horses which the kings of judah had given to the sun at the way into the house of the lord by the room of nathan melech the unsexed servant which was in the outer part of the building and the carriages of the sun he put on fire
 and the altars on the roof of the high room of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two outer squares of the house of the lord were pulled down and crushed to bits and the dust of them was put into the stream kidron
 and the high places before jerusalem on the south side of the mountain of destruction which solomon king of israel had made for ashtoreth the disgusting god of the zidonians and for chemosh the disgusting god of moab and for milcom the disgusting god of the children of ammon the king made unclean
 the stone pillars were broken to bits and the wood pillars cut down and the places where they had been were made full of the bones of the dead
 and the altar at beth el and the high place put up by jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel do evil that altar and that high place were pulled down and the high place was burned and crushed to dust and the asherah was burned
 then josiah turning round saw on the mountain the places of the dead and he sent and had the bones taken out of their places and burned on the altar so making it unclean as the lord had said by the man of god when jeroboam was in his place by the altar on that feast day and he turning his eyes to the resting place of the man of god who had given word of these things said
 what is that headstone i see over there and the men of the town said to him it is the resting place of the man of god who came from judah and gave word of all these things which you have done to the altar of beth el
 so he said let him be let not his bones be moved so they let his bones be with the bones of the prophet who came from samaria
 then josiah took away all the houses of the high places in the towns of samaria which the kings of israel had put up moving the lord to wrath and he did with them as he had done in beth el
 and all the priests of the high places there he put to death on the altars burning the bones of the dead on them and then he went back to jerusalem
 and the king gave orders to all the people saying keep the passover to the lord your god as it says in this book of the law
 truly such a passover had not been kept in all the days of the judges of israel or of the kings of israel or the kings of judah
 in the eighteenth year of the rule of king josiah this passover was kept to the lord in jerusalem
 and all those who had control of spirits and the wonder workers and the images and the false gods and all the disgusting things which were seen in the land of judah and in jerusalem josiah put away so that he might give effect to the words of the agreement recorded in the book which hilkiah the priest made discovery of in the house of the lord
 never before had there been a king like him turning to the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his power as the law of moses says and after him there was no king like him
 but still the heat of the lords wrath was not turned back from judah because of all manasseh had done in moving him to wrath
 and the lord said i will send judah away from before my face as i have sent israel i will have nothing more to do with this town which i had made mine even jerusalem and the holy house of which i said my name will be there
 now the rest of the acts of josiah and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 in his days pharaoh necoh king of egypt sent his armies against the king of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went out against him and he put him to death at megiddo when he had seen him
 and his servants took his body in a carriage from megiddo to jerusalem and put him into the earth there and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and put the holy oil on him and made him king in place of his father
 jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he became king ruling in jerusalem for three months his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his fathers had done
 and pharaoh necoh put him in chains at riblah in the land of hamath so that he might not be king in jerusalem and took from the land a tax of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
 then pharaoh necoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in place of josiah his father changing his name to jehoiakim but jehoahaz he took away to egypt where he was till his death
 and jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to pharaoh taxing the land by his orders to get the money the people of the land had to give silver and gold everyone as he was taxed to make the payment to pharaoh necoh
 jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for eleven years his mothers name was zebidah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his fathers had done
 in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim was his servant for three years then he took up arms against him
 and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldaeans and of the edomites and of the moabites and of the children of ammon sending them against judah for its destruction as he had said by his servants the prophets
 only by the word of the lord did this fate come on judah to take them away from before his face because of the sins of manasseh and all the evil he did
 and because of the death of those who had done no wrong for he made jerusalem full of the blood of the upright and the lord had no forgiveness for it
 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 so jehoiakim went to rest with his fathers and jehoiachin his son became king in his place
 and the king of egypt did not come out of his land again for the king of babylon had taken all his country from the stream of egypt to the river euphrates
 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king he was ruling in jerusalem for three months and his mothers name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his father had done
 at that time the armies of nebuchadnezzar came up to jerusalem and the town was shut in on every side
 and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came there while his servants were shutting in the town
 then jehoiachin king of judah went out to the king of babylon with his mother and his servants and his chiefs and his unsexed servants and in the eighth year of his rule the king of babylon took him
 and he took away all the stored wealth of the lords house and the goods from the kings store house cutting up all the gold vessels which solomon king of israel had made in the house of the lord as the lord had said
 and he took away all the people of jerusalem and all the chiefs and all the men of war ten thousand prisoners and all the expert workmen and the metal workers only the poorest sort of the people of the land were not taken away
 he took jehoiachin a prisoner to babylon with his mother and his wives and his unsexed servants and the great men of the land he took them all as prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
 and all the men of war seven thousand of them and a thousand expert workmen and metal workers all of them strong and able to take up arms the king of babylon took away as prisoners into babylon
 and the king of babylon made mattaniah his fathers brother king in place of jehoiachin changing his name to zedekiah
 zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king and he was king in jerusalem for eleven years his mothers name was hamutal daughter of jeremiah of libnah
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord as jehoiakim had done
 and because of the wrath of the lord this came about in jerusalem and judah till he had sent them all away from before him and zedekiah took up arms against the king of babylon
 now in the ninth year of his rule on the tenth day of the tenth month nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it building earthworks all round the town
 and the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of king zedekiah
 now on the ninth day of the fourth month the store of food in the town was almost gone so that there was no food for the people of the land
 so an opening was made in the wall of the town and all the men of war went in flight by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the kings garden  now the chaldaeans were stationed round the town  and the king went by the way of the arabah
 but the chaldaean army went after the king and overtook him in the lowlands of jericho and all his army went in flight from him in every direction
 and they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of babylon at riblah to be judged
 and they put the sons of zedekiah to death before his eyes and then they put out his eyes and chaining him with iron bands took him to babylon
 now in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month in the nineteenth year of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men a servant of the king of babylon came to jerusalem
 and he had the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great house burned with fire
 and the walls round jerusalem were broken down by the chaldaean army which was with the captain
 and the rest of the people who were still in the town and all those who had given themselves up to the king of babylon and all the rest of the workmen nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away as prisoners
 but he let the poorest of the land go on living there to take care of the vines and the fields
 and the brass pillars in the house of the lord and the wheeled bases and the great brass water vessel in the house of the lord were broken up by the chaldaeans who took the brass to babylon
 and the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons and all the brass vessels used in the lords house they took away
 and the fire trays and the basins the gold of the gold vessels and the silver of the silver vessels were all taken away by the captain of the armed men
 the two pillars the great water vessel and the wheeled bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight
 one of the pillars was eighteen cubits high with a crown of brass on it the crown was three cubits high circled with a network and apples all of brass and the second pillar had the same
 and the captain of the armed men took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three door keepers
 and from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war and five of the kings near friends who were in the town and the scribe of the captain of the army who was responsible for getting the people of the land together in military order and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town
 these nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took with him to the king of babylon at riblah
 and the king of babylon put them to death at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was taken away prisoner from his land
 as for the people who were still living in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon did not take away he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ruler over them
 now the captains of the armed forces hearing that the king of babylon had made gedaliah ruler came with their men to gedaliah at mizpah ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of the maacathite came with all their men
 then gedaliah gave his oath to them and their men saying have no fear because of the servants of the chaldaeans go on living in the land under the rule of the king of babylon and all will be well
 but in the seventh month ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the kings seed came with ten men and made an attack on gedaliah causing his death and the death of the jews and the chaldaeans who were with him at mizpah
 then all the people small and great and the captains of the forces got up and went away to egypt for fear of the chaldaeans
 and in the thirty seventh year after jehoiachin king of judah had been taken prisoner in the twelfth month on the twenty seventh day of the month evil merodach king of babylon in the first year of his rule took jehoiachin king of judah out of prison
 and said kind words to him and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in babylon
 and his prison clothing was changed and he was a guest at the kings table every day for the rest of his life
 and for his food the king gave him a regular amount every day for the rest of his life
 and jehoram the son of ahab became king over israel in samaria in the eighteenth year of the rule of jehoshaphat king of judah and he was king for twelve years
 he did evil in the eyes of the lord but not like his father and his mother for he put away the stone pillar of baal which his father had made
 but still he did the same sins which jeroboam the son of nebat did and made israel do he went on in them
 now mesha king of moab was a sheep farmer and he gave regularly to the king of israel the wool from a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand sheep
 but when ahab was dead the king of moab got free from the authority of the king of israel
 at that time king jehoram went out from samaria and got all israel together in fighting order
 and he sent to jehoshaphat king of judah saying the king of moab has got free from my authority will you go with me to make war on moab and he said i will go with you i am as you are my people as your people and my horses as your horses
 and he said which way are we to go and he said in answer by the waste land of edom
 so the king of israel went with the king of judah and the king of edom by a roundabout way for seven days and there was no water for the army or for the beasts they had with them
 and the king of israel said here is trouble for the lord has got these three kings together to give them into the hands of moab
 but jehoshaphat said is there no prophet of the lord here through whom we may get directions from the lord and one of the king of israels men said in answer elisha the son of shaphat is here who was servant to elijah
 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him
 but elisha said to the king of israel what have i to do with you go to the prophets of your father and your mother and the king of israel said no for the lord has got these three kings together to give them up into the hands of moab
 then elisha said by the life of the lord of armies whose servant i am if it was not for the respect i have for jehoshaphat king of judah i would not give a look at you or see you
 but now get me a player of music and it will come about that while the man is playing the hand of the lord will come on me and i will give you the word of the lord and they got a player of music and while the man was playing the hand of the lord was on him
 and he said the lord says i will make this valley full of water holes
 for the lord says though you see no wind or rain the valley will be full of water and you and your armies and your beasts will have drink
 and this will be only a small thing to the lord in addition he will give the moabites into your hands
 and you are to put every walled town to destruction cutting down every good tree and stopping up every water spring and making all the good land rough with stones
 now in the morning about the time when the offering was made they saw water flowing from the direction of edom till the country was full of water
 now all moab hearing that the kings had come to make war against them got together all who were able to take up arms and went forward to the edge of the country
 and early in the morning they got up when the sun was shining on the water and they saw the water facing them as red as blood
 then they said this is blood it is clear that destruction has come on the kings they have been fighting one another now come moab let us take their goods
 but when they came to the tents of israel the israelites came out and made a violent attack on the moabites so that they went in flight before them and they went forward still attacking them
 pulling down the towns covering every good field with stones stopping up all the water springs and cutting down all the good trees they went on driving moab before them till only in kir hareseth were there any moabites and the fighting men went round the town raining stones on it
 and when the king of moab saw that the fight was going against him he took with him seven hundred men armed with swords with the idea of forcing a way through to the king of aram but they were not able to do so
 then he took his oldest son who would have been king after him offering him as a burned offering on the wall so there was great wrath against israel and they went away from him back to their country
 now a certain woman the wife of one of the sons of the prophets came crying to elisha and said your servant my husband is dead and to your knowledge he was a worshipper of the lord but now the creditor has come to take my two children as servants in payment of his debt
 then elisha said to her what am i to do for you say now what have you in the house and she said your servant has nothing in the house but a pot of oil
 then he said go out to all your neighbours and get vessels a very great number of them
 then go in and shutting the door on yourself and your sons put oil into all these vessels putting on one side the full ones
 so she went away and when the door was shut on her and her sons they took the vessels to her and she put oil into them
 and when all the vessels were full she said to her son get me another vessel and he said there are no more and the flow of oil was stopped
 so she came to the man of god and gave him word of what she had done and he said go and get money for the oil and make payment of your debt and let the rest be for the needs of yourself and your sons
 now there came a day when elisha went to shunem and there was a woman of high position living there who made him come in and have a meal with her and after that every time he went by he went into her house for a meal
 and she said to her husband now i see that this is a holy man of god who comes by day after day
 so let us make a little room on the wall and put a bed there for him and a table and a seat and a light so that when he comes to us he will be able to go in there
 now one day when he had gone there he went into the little room and took his rest there
 and he said to gehazi his servant send for this shunammite so in answer to his voice she came before him
 and he said to him now say to her see you have taken all this trouble for us what is to be done for you will you have any request made for you to the king or the captain of the army but she said i am living among my people
 so he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi made answer still there is this she has no son and her husband is old
 then he said send for her and in answer to his voice she took her place at the door
 and elisha said at this time in the coming year you will have a son in your arms and she said no my lord o man of god do not say what is false to your servant
 then the woman became with child and gave birth to a son at the time named in the year after as elisha had said to her
 now one day when the child was older he went out to his father to where the grain was being cut
 and he said to his father my head my head  and the father said to a servant take him in to his mother
 and he took him in to his mother and she took him on her knees and kept him there till the middle of the day when his life went from him
 then she went up and put him on the bed of the man of god shutting the door on him and went out
 and she said to her husband send me one of the servants and one of the asses so that i may go quickly to the man of god and come back again
 and he said why are you going to him today it is not a new moon or a sabbath but she said it is well
 then she made the ass ready and said to her servant keep driving on do not make a stop without orders from me
 so she went and came to mount carmel to the man of god and when the man of god saw her coming in his direction he said to gehazi his servant see there is the shunammite
 go quickly to her and on meeting her say to her are you well and your husband and the child are they well and she said in answer all is well
 and when she came to where the man of god was on the hill she put her hands round his feet and gehazi came near with the purpose of pushing her away but the man of god said let her be for her soul is bitter in her and the lord has kept it secret from me and has not given me word of it
 then she said did i make a request to my lord for a son did i not say do not give me false words
 then he said to gehazi make yourself ready and take my stick in your hand and go if you come across anyone on the way give him no blessing and if anyone gives you a blessing give him no answer and put my stick on the childs face
 but the mother of the child said as the lord is living and as your soul is living i will not go back without you so he got up and went with her
 and gehazi went on before them and put the stick on the childs face but there was no voice and no one gave attention so he went back and meeting him gave him the news saying the child is not awake
 and when elisha came into the house he saw the child dead stretched on his bed
 so he went in and shutting the door on the two of them made prayer to the lord
 then he got up on the bed stretching himself out on the child and put his mouth on the childs mouth his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands and the childs body became warm
 then he came back and after walking once through the house and back he went up stretching himself out on the child seven times and the childs eyes became open
 and he gave orders to gehazi and said send for the shunammite and she came in answer to his voice and he said take up your son
 and she came in and went down on her face to the earth at his feet then she took her son in her arms and went out
 and elisha went back to gilgal now there was very little food in the land and the sons of the prophets were seated before him and he said to his servant put the great pot on the fire and make soup for the sons of the prophets
 and one went out into the field to get green plants and saw a vine of the field and pulling off the fruit of it till the fold of his robe was full he came back and put the fruit cut up small into the pot of soup having no idea what it was
 then they gave the men soup from the pot and while they were drinking the soup they gave a cry and said o man of god there is death in the pot and they were not able to take any more food
 but he said get some meal and he put it into the pot and said now give it to the people so that they may have food and there was nothing bad in the pot
 now a man came from baal shalishah with an offering of first fruits for the man of god twenty barley cakes and garden fruit in his bag and he said give these to the people for food
 but his servant said how am i to put this before a hundred men but he said give it to the people for food for the lord says there will be food for them and some over
 so he put it before them and they had a meal and there was more than enough as the lord had said
 now naaman chief of the army of the king of aram was a man of high position with his master and greatly respected because by him the lord had given salvation to aram but he was a leper
 now the aramaeans had gone out in bands and taken prisoner from israel a little girl who became servant to naamans wife
 and she said to her masters wife if only my lord would go to the prophet in samaria he would make him well
 and someone went and said to his lord this is what the girl from the land of israel says
 so the king of aram said go then and i will send a letter to the king of israel and he went taking with him ten talents of silver and six thousand shekels of gold and ten changes of clothing
 and he took the letter to the king of israel in which the king of aram had said see i have sent my servant naaman to you to be made well for he is a leper
 but the king of israel after reading the letter was greatly troubled and said am i god to give death and life why does this man send a leper to me to be made well is it not clear that he is looking for a cause of war
 now elisha the man of god hearing that the king of israel had done this sent to the king saying why are you troubled send the man to me so that he may see that there is a prophet in israel
 so naaman with all his horses and his carriages came to the door of elishas house
 and elisha sent a servant to him saying go to jordan and after washing seven times in its waters your flesh will be well again and you will be clean
 but naaman was angry and went away and said i had the idea that he would come out to see such an important person as i am and make prayer to the lord his god and with a wave of his hand over the place make the leper well
 are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not be washed in them and become clean so turning he went away in wrath
 then his servants came to him and said if the prophet had given you orders to do some great thing would you not have done it how much more then when he says to you be washed and become clean
 then he went down seven times into the waters of jordan as the man of god had said and his flesh became like the flesh of a little child again and he was clean
 then he went back to the man of god with all his train and taking his place before him said now i am certain that there is no god in all the earth but only in israel now then take an offering from me
 but he said by the life of the lord whose servant i am i will take nothing from you and he did his best to make him take it but he would not
 then naaman said if you will not then let there be given to your servant as much earth as two beasts are able to take on their backs because from now on your servant will make no offering or burned offering to other gods but only to the lord
 but may your servant have the lords forgiveness for this one thing when my master goes into the house of rimmon for worship there supported on my arm and my head is bent in the house of rimmon when his head is bent in the house of rimmon may your servant have the lords forgiveness for this thing
 and he said to him go in peace and he went from him some distance
 but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said now my master has taken nothing from naaman this aramaean of what he would have given him by the living lord i will go after him and get something from him
 so gehazi went after naaman and when naaman saw him running after him he got down from his carriage and went back to him and said is all well
 and he said all is well but my master has sent me saying even now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of ephraim will you give me a talent of silver and two changes of clothing for them
 and naaman said be good enough to take two talents and forcing him to take them he put two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothing and gave them to his two servants to take before him
 when he came to the hill he took them from their hands and put them away in the house and he sent the men away and they went
 then he came in and took his place before his master and elisha said to him where have you come from gehazi and he said your servant went nowhere
 and he said to him did not my heart go with you when the man got down from his carriage and went back to you is this a time for getting money and clothing and olive gardens and vine gardens and sheep and oxen and men servants and women servants
 because of what you have done the disease of naaman the leper will take you in its grip and your seed after you for ever and he went out from before him a leper as white as snow
 now the sons of the prophets said to elisha there is not room enough for us in the place where we are living under your care
 so let us go to jordan and let everyone get to work cutting boards and we will make a living place for ourselves there and he said to them go then
 and one of them said be pleased to go with your servants and he said i will go
 so he went with them and when they came to jordan they got to work cutting down trees
 but one of them while cutting a board let the head of his axe go into the water and he gave a cry and said this is a bad business my master for it is anothers
 and the man of god said where did it go in and when he saw the place where it had gone into the water cutting a stick he put it into the water and the iron came up to the top of the water
 then he said take it up so he put out his hand and took it
 at that time the king of aram was making war against israel and he had a meeting with the chiefs of his army and said i will be waiting in secret in some named place
 and the man of god sent to the king of israel saying take care to keep away from that place for the aramaeans are waiting there in secret
 so the king of israel sent to the place where the man of god had said there was danger and kept clear of it more than once
 and at this the mind of the king of aram was greatly troubled and he sent for his servants and said to them will you not make clear to me which of us is helping the king of israel
 and one of them said not one of us my lord king but elisha the prophet in israel gives the king of israel news of the words you say even in your bedroom
 then he said go and see where he is so that i may send and get him and news came to him that he was in dothan
 so he sent there horses and carriages and a great army and they came by night circling the town
 now the servant of the man of god having got up early and gone out saw an army with horses and carriages of war all round the town and the servant said to him o my master what are we to do
 and he said in answer have no fear those who are with us are more than those who are with them
 then elisha made a prayer to the lord saying lord let his eyes be open so that he may see and the lord made the young mans eyes open and he saw that all the mountain was full of horses and carriages of fire round elisha
 now when the aramaeans came down to elisha he made a prayer to the lord saying lord make this people blind and he made them blind at elishas request
 and elisha said to them this is not the way and this is not the town come after me so that i may take you to the man you are searching for and he took them to samaria
 and when they had come into samaria elisha said lord let the eyes of these men be open so that they may see and the lord made their eyes open and they saw that they were in the middle of samaria
 and the king of israel when he saw them said to elisha my father am i to put them to the sword
 but he said in answer you are not to put them to death have you any right to put to death those whom you have not taken prisoner with your sword and your bow put bread and water before them so that they may have food and drink and go to their master
 so he made ready a great feast for them and when they had had food and drink he sent them away and they went back to their master and no more bands of aramaeans came into the land of israel
 now after this ben hadad king of aram got together all his army and went up to make an attack on samaria shutting the town in on all sides with his forces
 and they became very short of food in samaria for they kept it shut in till the price of an asss head was eighty shekels of silver and a small measure of doves droppings was five shekels of silver
 and when the king of israel was going by on the wall a woman came crying out to him and said help  my lord king
 and he said if the lord does not give you help where am i to get help for you from the grain floor or the grape crusher
 and the king said to her what is troubling you and she said in answer this woman said to me give your son to be our food today and we will have my son tomorrow
 so boiling my son we had a meal of him and on the day after i said to her now give your son for our food but she has put her son in a secret place
 then the king hearing what the woman said took his robes in his hands violently parting them and while he was walking on the wall the people looking saw that under his robe he had haircloth on his flesh
 then he said may gods punishment come on me if elisha the son of shaphat keeps his head on his body after this day
 but elisha was in his house and the responsible men were seated there with him and before the king got there elisha said to those who were with him do you see how this cruel and violent man has sent to take away my life
 while he was still talking to them the king came down and said this evil is from the lord why am i to go on waiting any longer for the lord
 then elisha said give ear to the word of the lord the lord says tomorrow about this time a measure of good meal will be offered for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the market place of samaria
 then the captain whose arm was supporting the king said to the man of god even if the lord made windows in heaven would such a thing be possible and he said your eyes will see it but you will not have a taste of the food
 now there were four lepers seated at the doorway into the town and they said to one another why are we waiting here for death
 if we say we will go into the town there is no food in the town and we will come to our end there and if we go on waiting here death will come to us come then let us give ourselves up to the army of aram if they let us go on living then life will be ours and if they put us to death then death will be ours
 so in the half light they got up to go to the tents of aram but when they came to the outer line of tents there was no one there
 for the lord had made the sound of carriages and horses and the noise of a great army come to the ears of the aramaeans so that they said to one another truly the king of israel has got the kings of the hittites and of the egyptians for a price to make an attack on us
 so they got up and went in flight in the half light without their tents or their horses or their asses or any of their goods they went in flight fearing for their lives
 and when those lepers came to the outer line of tents they went into one tent and had food and drink and took from it silver and gold and clothing which they put in a secret place then they came back and went into another tent from which they took more goods which they put away in a secret place
 then they said to one another we are not doing right today is a day of good news and we say nothing if we go on waiting here till the morning punishment will come to us so let us go and give the news to those of the kings house
 so they came in and crying out to the door keepers of the town they gave them the news saying we came to the tents of the aramaeans and there was no one there and no voice of man only the horses and the asses in their places and the tents as they were
 then the door keepers crying out gave the news to those inside the kings house
 then the king got up in the night and said to his servants this is my idea of what the aramaeans have done to us they have knowledge that we are without food and so they have gone out of their tents and are waiting secretly in the open country saying when they come out of the town we will take them living and get into the town
 and one of his servants said in answer send men and let them take five of the horses which we still have in the town if they keep their lives they will be the same as those of israel who are still living here if they come to their death they will be the same as all those of israel who have gone to destruction let us send and see
 so they took two horsemen and the king sent them after the army of the aramaeans saying go and see
 and they went after them as far as jordan and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the aramaeans in their flight so those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king
 then the people went out and took the goods from the tents of the aramaeans so a measure of good meal was to be had for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel as the lord had said
 and the king gave authority to that captain on whose arm he was supported to have control over the doorway into the town but he was crushed to death there under the feet of the people as the man of god had said when the king went down to him
 so the words of the man of god came true which he said to the king two measures of barley will be offered for the price of a shekel and a measure of good meal for a shekel tomorrow about this time in the market place of samaria
 and that captain said to the man of god even if the lord made windows in heaven would such a thing be possible and he said to him your eyes will see it but you will not have a taste of the food
 and such was his fate for he was crushed to death under the feet of the people in the doorway into the town
 now elisha had said to the woman whose son he had given back to life go now with all the people of your house and get a living place for yourselves wherever you are able for by the word of the lord there will be great need of food in the land and this will go on for seven years
 so the woman got up and did as the man of god said and she and the people of her house were living in the land of the philistines for seven years
 and when the seven years were ended the woman came back from the land of the philistines and went to the king with a request for her house and her land
 now the king was talking with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying now give me an account of all the great things elisha has done
 and while he was giving the king the story of how elisha had given life to the dead the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land and gehazi said my lord king this is the woman and this is her son whose life elisha gave back to him
 and in answer to the kings questions the woman gave him all the story so the king gave orders to one of his unsexed servants saying give her back all her property and all the produce of her fields from the day when she went away from the land up till now
 and elisha came to damascus and ben hadad king of aram was ill and they said to him the man of god has come
 then the king said to hazael take an offering with you and go to see the man of god and get directions from the lord by him saying am i going to get better from my disease
 so hazael went to see him taking with him forty camels with offerings on their backs of every sort of good thing from damascus and when he came before him he said your son ben hadad king of aram has sent me to you saying will i get better from this disease
 and elisha said to him go say to him you will certainly get better but the lord has made it clear to me that only death is before him
 and he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed and the man of god was overcome with weeping
 and hazael said why is my lord weeping then he said in answer because i see the evil which you will do to the children of israel burning down their strong towns putting their young men to death with the sword smashing their little ones against the stones and cutting open the women who are with child
 and hazael said how is it possible that your servant who is only a dog will do this great thing and elisha said the lord has made it clear to me that you will be king over aram
 then he went away from elisha and came in to his master who said to him what did elisha say to you and his answer was he said that you would certainly get well
 now on the day after hazael took the bed cover and making it wet with water put it over ben hadads face causing his death and hazael became king in his place
 in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah became king
 he was thirty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for eight years
 he went in the ways of the kings of israel as the family of ahab did for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the eyes of the lord
 but it was not the lords purpose to send destruction on judah because of david his servant to whom he had given his word that he would have a light for ever
 in his time edom made themselves free from the rule of judah and took a king for themselves
 then joram went over to zair with all his war carriages  made an attack by night on the edomites whose forces were all round him  the captains of the war carriages and the people went in flight to their tents
 so edom made themselves free from the rule of judah to this day and at the same time libnah made itself free
 now the rest of the acts of joram and all he did are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of judah
 and joram went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of david and ahaziah his son became king in his place
 in the twelfth year that joram the son of ahab was king of israel ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah became king
 ahaziah was twenty two years old when he became king and he was ruling in jerusalem for one year his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel
 he went in the ways of the family of ahab and did evil in the eyes of the lord as the family of ahab did for he was a son in law of the family of ahab
 he went with joram the son of ahab to make war on hazael king of aram at ramoth gilead and joram was wounded by the aramaeans
 so king joram went back to jezreel to get well from the wounds which the bowmen had given him at ramah when he was fighting against hazael king of aram and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was ill
 and elisha the prophet sent for one of the sons of the prophets and said to him make yourself ready for a journey and take this bottle of oil in your hand and go to ramoth gilead
 and when you get there go in search of jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him get up from among his brothers and take him to an inner room
 then take the bottle and put the oil on his head and say the lord says i have put the holy oil on you to make you king over israel then opening the door go in flight without waiting
 so the young prophet went to ramoth gilead
 and when he came he saw the captains of the army seated together and he said i have something to say to you o captain and jehu said to which of us and he said to you o captain
 and he got up and went into the house then he put the holy oil on his head and said to him the lord the god of israel says i have made you king over the people of the lord over israel
 you are to see that the family of ahab your master is cut off so that i may take from jezebel payment for the blood of my servants the prophets and for the blood of all the servants of the lord
 for the family of ahab will come to an end every male of ahabs family will be cut off he who is shut up and he who goes free in israel
 i will make the family of ahab like that of jeroboam the son of nebat and baasha the son of ahijah
 and jezebel will become food for the dogs in the heritage of jezreel and there will be no one to put her body into the earth then opening the door he went in flight
 then jehu came out again to the servants of his lord and one said to him is all well why did this man who is off his head come to you and he said to them you have knowledge of the man and of his talk
 and they said that is not true now give us his story then he said this is what he said to me the lord says i have made you king over israel
 then straight away everyone took his robe and put it under him on the top of the steps and sounding the horn they said jehu is king
 so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi made designs against joram  now joram and all the army of israel were keeping watch on ramoth gilead because of hazael king of aram
 but king joram had gone back to jezreel to get well from the wounds which the aramaeans had given him when he was fighting against hazael king of aram  and jehu said if this is your purpose then let no one get away and go out of the town to give news of it in jezreel
 so jehu got into his carriage and went to jezreel for joram was ill in bed there and ahaziah king of judah had come down to see joram
 and the watchman on the tower in jezreel saw jehu and his band coming and said i see a band of people and joram said send out a horseman to them and let him say is it peace
 so a horseman went out to them and said the king says is it peace and jehu said what have you to do with peace come after me and the watchman gave them word saying the horseman went up to them but has not come back
 then he sent out a second horseman who came up to them and said the king says is it peace and jehu said in answer what have you to do with peace come after me
 and the watchman gave them word saying he went up to them and has not come back again and the driving is like the driving of jehu son of nimshi for he is driving violently
 then joram said make ready so they made his carriage ready and joram king of israel with ahaziah king of judah went out in their carriages for the purpose of meeting jehu and they came face to face with him at the field of naboth the jezreelite
 now when joram saw jehu he said is it peace jehu and he said in answer what peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother jezebel and her secret arts
 then joram turning his horses in flight said to ahaziah broken faith o ahaziah 
 then jehu took his bow in his hand and with all his strength sent an arrow wounding joram between the arms and the arrow came out at his heart and he went down on his face in his carriage
 then jehu said to bidkar his captain take him up and put him in the field of naboth the jezreelite for is not that day in your memory when you and i together on our horses were going after ahab his father and the lord put this fate on him saying
 i saw the blood of naboth and of his sons yesterday and i will give you full payment in this field says the lord so now take him and put him in this field as the lord said
 now when ahaziah king of judah saw this he went in flight by the way of the garden house and jehu came after him and said put him to death in the same way and they gave him a death wound in his carriage on the slope up to gur by ibleam and he went in flight to megiddo where death came to him
 and his servants took him in a carriage to jerusalem and put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of david
  in the eleventh year of the rule of joram the son of ahab ahaziah became king over judah 
 and when jehu came to jezreel jezebel had news of it and painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments she put her head out of the window
 and when jehu was coming into the town she said is all well o zimri taker of your masters life
 then looking up to the window he said who is on my side who and two or three unsexed servants put out their heads
 and he said take her and put her out of the window so they sent her down with force and her blood went in a shower on the wall and on the horses and she was crushed under their feet
 and he came in and took food and drink then he said now see to this cursed woman and put her body into the earth for she is a kings daughter
 and they went out to put her body into the earth but nothing of her was to be seen only the bones of her head and her feet and parts of her hands
 so they came back and gave him word of it and he said this is what the lord said by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the heritage of jezreel the flesh of jezebel will become food for dogs
 and the dead body of jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of jezreel so that they will not be able to say this is jezebel
 now after the death of saul when david having come back from the destruction of the amalekites had been in ziklag for two days
 on the third day a man came from sauls tents with his clothing out of order and earth on his head and when he came to david he went down on the earth and gave him honour
 and david said to him where have you come from and he said i have come in flight from the tents of israel
 and david said to him how did things go give me the news and in answer he said the people have gone in flight from the fight and a great number of them are dead and saul and his son jonathan are dead
 and david said to the young man who gave him the news why are you certain that saul and his son jonathan are dead
 and the young man said i came by chance to mount gilboa and i saw saul supporting himself on his spear and the war carriages and horsemen overtook him
 and looking back he saw me and gave a cry to me and answering him i said here am i
 and he said to me who are you and i said i am an amalekite
 then he said to me come here to my side and put me to death for the pain of death has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me
 so i put my foot on him and gave him his death blow because i was certain that he would not go on living after his fall and i took the crown from his head and the band from his arm and i have them here for my lord
 then david gave way to bitter grief and so did all the men who were with him
 and till evening they gave themselves to sorrow and weeping and took no food weeping for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the men of israel because they had come to their end by the sword
 and david said to the young man who had given him the news where do you come from and he said i am the son of a man from a strange land i am an amalekite
 and david said to him had you no fear of stretching out your hand to put to death the one marked with the holy oil
 and david sent for one of his young men and said go near and put an end to him and he put him to death
 and david said to him may your blood be on your head for your mouth has given witness against you saying i have put to death the man marked with the holy oil
 then david made this song of grief for saul and jonathan his son
  it is recorded in the book of jashar for teaching to the sons of judah  and he said
 the glory o israel is dead on your high places  how have the great ones been made low 
 give no news of it in gath let it not be said in the streets of ashkelon or the daughters of the philistines will be glad the daughters of men without circumcision will be uplifted in joy
 o mountains of gilboa let there be no dew or rain on you you fields of death for there the arms of the strong have been shamed the arms of saul as if he had not been marked with the holy oil
 from the blood of the dead from the fat of the strong the bow of jonathan was not turned back the sword of saul did not come back unused
 saul and jonathan were loved and pleasing in their lives and in their death they were not parted they went more quickly than eagles they were stronger than lions
 o daughters of israel have sorrow for saul by whom you were delicately clothed in robes of red with ornaments of gold on your dresses
 how have the great ones been made low in the fight  jonathan is dead on your high places
 i am full of grief for you my brother jonathan very dear have you been to me your love for me was a wonder greater than the love of women
 how have the great ones been made low and the arms of war broken 
 now after this death came to the king of the children of ammon and hanun his son became king in his place
 and david said i will be a friend to hanun the son of nahash as his father was a friend to me so david sent his servants to give him words of comfort on account of his father and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon
 but the chiefs of the children of ammon said to hanun their lord does it seem to you that david is honouring your father by sending comforters to you has he not sent his servants to go through the town and make secret observation of it and overcome it
 so hanun took davids servants and after cutting off half the hair on their chins and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle he sent them away
 when david had news of it he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on their way for the men were greatly shamed and the king said go to jericho till your hair is long again and then come back
 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by david they sent to the aramaeans of beth rehob and zobah and got for payment twenty thousand footmen and they got from the king of maacah a thousand men and from tob twelve thousand
 and hearing of this david sent joab and all the army and the best fighting men
 and the children of ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town and the aramaeans of zobah and of rehob with the men of tob and maacah were by themselves in the field
 now when joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back he took the best of the men of israel and put them in line against the aramaeans
 and the rest of the people he put in position against the children of ammon with abishai his brother at their head
 and he said if the aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me then you are to come to my help but if the children of ammon get the better of you i will come to your help
 take heart and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our god and may the lord do what seems good to him
 then joab and the people with him went forward to the fight against the aramaeans and they went in flight before him
 and when the children of ammon saw the flight of the aramaeans they themselves went in flight from abishai and came into the town so joab went back from fighting the children of ammon and came to jerusalem
 and when the aramaeans saw that israel had overcome them they got themselves together
 and hadadezer sent for the aramaeans who were on the other side of the river and they came to helam with shobach the captain of hadadezers army at their head
 and word of this was given to david and he got all israel together and went over jordan and came to helam and the aramaeans put their forces in position against david and made an attack on him
 and the aramaeans went in flight before israel and david put to the sword the men of seven hundred aramaean war carriages and forty thousand footmen and shobach the captain of the army was wounded and came to his death there
 and when all the kings who were servants of hadadezer saw that they were overcome by israel they made peace with israel and became their servants so the aramaeans in fear gave no more help to the children of ammon
 now in the spring at the time when kings go out to war david sent joab and his servants and all israel with him and they made waste the land of the children of ammon and took up their position before rabbah shutting it in but david was still at jerusalem
 now one evening david got up from his bed and while he was walking on the roof of the kings house he saw from there a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful
 and david sent to get knowledge who the woman was and one said is this not bath sheba the daughter of eliam and wife of uriah the hittite
 and david sent and took her and she came to him and he took her to his bed  for she had been made clean  then she went back to her house
 and the woman became with child and she sent word to david that she was with child
 and david sent to joab saying send uriah the hittite to me and joab sent uriah to david
 and when uriah came to him david put questions to him about how joab and the people were and how the war was going
 and david said to uriah go down to your house and let your feet be washed and uriah went away from the kings house and an offering from the king was sent after him
 but uriah took his rest at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and did not go down to his house
 and when word was given to david that uriah had not gone down to his house david said to uriah have you not come from a journey why did you not go down to your house
 and uriah said to david israel and judah with the ark are living in tents and my lord joab and the other servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field and am i to go to my house and take food and drink and go to bed with my wife by the living lord and by the life of your soul i will not do such a thing
 and david said to uriah be here today and after that i will let you go so uriah was in jerusalem that day and the day after
 and when david sent for him he took meat and drink with him and david made him the worse for drink and when evening came he went to rest on his bed with the servants of his lord but he did not go down to his house
 now in the morning david gave uriah a letter to take to joab
 and in the letter he said take care to put uriah in the very front of the line where the fighting is most violent and go back from him so that he may be overcome and put to death
 so while joab was watching the town he put uriah in the place where it was clear to him the best fighters were
 and the men of the town went out and had a fight with joab and a number of davids men came to their death in the fight and with them uriah the hittite
 then joab sent david news of everything which had taken place in the war
 and he gave orders to the man who took the news saying after you have given the king all the news about the war
 if the king is angry and says why did you go so near the town for the fight was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall
 who put abimelech the son of jerubbaal to death did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall putting him to death at thebez why did you go so near the wall then say to him your servant uriah the hittite is among the dead
 so the man went and came to david and gave him all the news which joab had sent him to give then david was angry with joab and said why did you go so near the town for the fight was it not certain that their archers would be on the wall who put abimelech the son of jerubbaal to death did not a woman send a great stone down on him from the wall putting him to death at thebez why did you go so near the wall
 and the man said to david truly the men got the better of us and came out against us into the open country but we sent them back to the very doors of the town
 and the archers sent their arrows at your servants from the wall and some of the kings servants are dead and among them is your servant uriah the hittite
 then david said to the man go and say to joab do not let this be a grief to you for one man may come to his death by the sword like another put up an even stronger fight against the town and take it and do you put heart into him
 and when the wife of uriah had news that her husband was dead she gave herself up to weeping for him
 and when the days of weeping were past david sent for her and took her into his house and she became his wife and gave him a son but the lord was not pleased with the thing david had done
 and the lord sent nathan to david and nathan came to him and said there were two men in the same town one a man of great wealth and the other a poor man
 the man of wealth had great numbers of flocks and herds
 but the poor man had only one little she lamb which he had got and taken care of from its birth it had been with him like one of his children his meat was its food and from his cup it took its drink resting in his arms and it was like a daughter to him
 now a traveller came to the house of the man of wealth but he would not take anything from his flock or his herd to make a meal for the traveller who had come to him but he took the poor mans lamb and made it ready for the man who had come
 and david was full of wrath against that man and he said to nathan by the living lord death is the right punishment for the man who has done this
 and he will have to give back four times the value of the lamb because he has done this and because he had no pity
 and nathan said to david you are that man the lord god of israel says i made you king over israel putting holy oil on you and i kept you safe from the hands of saul
 i gave you your masters daughter and your masters wives for yourself and i gave you the daughters of israel and judah and if that had not been enough i would have given you such and such things
 why then have you had no respect for the word of the lord doing what is evil in his eyes you have put uriah the hittite to death with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife you have put him to death with the sword of the children of ammon
 so now the sword will never be turned away from your family because you have had no respect for me and have taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be your wife
 the lord says from those of your family i will send evil against you and before your very eyes i will take your wives and give them to your neighbour and he will take your wives to his bed by the light of this sun
 you did it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and in the light of the sun
 and david said to nathan great is my sin against the lord and nathan said to david the lord has put away your sin death will not come on you
 but still because you have had no respect for the lord death will certainly overtake the child who has newly come to birth
 then nathan went back to his house and the hand of the lord was on davids son the child of uriahs wife and it became very ill
 so david made prayer to god for the child and he took no food day after day and went in and stretching himself out on the earth was there all night
 and the chief men of his house got up and went to his side to make him get up from the earth but he would not and he would not take food with them
 and then on the seventh day the childs death took place and davids servants were in fear of giving him the news of the childs death for they said truly while the child was still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him what will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead
 but when david saw that his servants were talking together quietly he was certain that the child was dead and he said to his servants is the child dead and they said he is
 then david got up from the earth and after washing and rubbing himself with oil and changing his clothing he went into the house of the lord and gave worship then he went back to his house and at his order they put food before him and he had a meal
 then his servants said to him why have you been acting in this way you were weeping and going without food while the child was still living but when the child was dead you got up and had a meal
 and he said while the child was still living i went without food and gave myself up to weeping for i said who is able to say that the lord will not have mercy on me and give the child life
 but now that the child is dead there is no reason for me to go without food am i able to make him come back to life i will go to him but he will never come back to me
 and david gave comfort to his wife bath sheba and he went in to her and had connection with her and she had a son to whom she gave the name solomon and he was dear to the lord
 and he sent word by nathan the prophet who gave him the name jedidiah by the word of the lord
 now joab was fighting against rabbah in the land of the children of ammon and he took the water town
 and joab sent men to david saying i have made war against rabbah and have taken the water town
 so now get the rest of the people together and put them in position against the town and take it for if i take it it will be named after my name
 then david got all the people together and went to rabbah and made war on it and took it
 and he took the crown of milcom from his head the weight of it was a talent of gold and in it were stones of great price and it was put on davids head and he took a great store of goods from the town
 and he took the people out of the town and put them to work with wood cutting instruments and iron grain crushers and iron axes and at brick making this he did to all the towns of the children of ammon then david and all the people went back to jerusalem
 now after this it came about that absalom davids son had a beautiful sister whose name was tamar and davids son amnon was in love with her
 and he was so deeply in love that he became ill because of his sister tamar for she was a virgin and so it seemed hard to amnon to do anything to her
 but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very wise man
 and he said to him o son of the king why are you getting thinner day by day will you not say what your trouble is and amnon said to him i am in love with tamar my brother absaloms sister
 then jonadab said to him go to your bed and let it seem that you are ill and when your father comes to see you say to him let my sister tamar come and give me bread and get the food ready before my eyes so that i may see it and take it from her hand
 so amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill and when the king came to see him amnon said to the king please let my sister tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes so that i may take food from her hand
 then david sent to the house for tamar and said go now to your brother amnons house and get a meal for him
 so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was in bed and she took paste and made cakes before his eyes cooking them over the fire
 and she took the cooking pot and put the cakes before him but he would not take them and amnon said let everyone go away from me so they all went out
 then amnon said to tamar take the food and come into my bedroom so that i may take it from your hand so tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother amnons bedroom
 and when she took them to give them to him he put his arms round her and said come to bed my sister
 and answering him she said o my brother do not put shame on me it is not right for such a thing to be done in israel do not this evil thing
 what will become of me in my shame and as for you you will be looked down on with disgust by all israel now then go and make your request to the king for he will not keep me from you
 but he would not give attention to what she said but being stronger than she he took her by force and had connection with her
 then amnon was full of hate for her hating her with a hate greater than his earlier love for her and he said to her get up and be gone
 and she said to him not so my brother for this great wrong in sending me away is worse than what you did to me before but he gave no attention to her
 then he gave a cry to the servant who was waiting on him and said put this woman out and let the door be locked after her
 now she had on a long robe such as in past times the kings virgin daughters were dressed in then the servant put her out locking the door after her
 and tamar in her grief put dust on her head and she put her hand on her head and went away crying loudly
 and her brother absalom said to her has your brother amnon been with you but now let there be an end to your crying my sister he is your brother do not take this thing to heart so tamar went on living uncomforted in her brothers house
 but when king david had news of all these things he was very angry but he did not make trouble for amnon his son for he was dear to david being his oldest son
 but absalom said nothing to his brother amnon good or bad for he was full of hate for him because he had taken his sister tamar by force
 now after two full years absalom had men cutting the wool of his sheep in baal hazor which is near ephraim and he sent for all the kings sons to come to his feast
 and absalom came to the king and said see now your servant is cutting the wool of his sheep will the king and his servants be pleased to come
 and the king said to absalom no my son let us not all go or the number will be over great for you and he made his request again but he would not go but he gave him his blessing
 then absalom said if you will not go then let my brother amnon go with us and the king said to him is there any reason for him to go with you
 but absalom went on requesting him till he let amnon and all the kings sons go with him and absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king
 now absalom had given orders to his servants saying now take note when amnons heart is glad with wine and when i say to you make an attack on amnon then put him to death without fear have i not given you orders be strong and without fear
 so absaloms servants did to amnon as absalom had given them orders then all the kings sons got up and every man got on his beast and went in flight
 now while they were on their way news was given to david that absalom had put to death all the sons of the king and that not one of them was still living
 then the king got up in great grief stretching himself out on the earth and all his servants were by his side with their clothing parted
 and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother said let not my lord have the idea that all the sons of the king have been put to death for only amnon is dead this has been purposed by absalom from the day when he took his sister tamar by force
 so now let not my lord the king take this thing to heart with the idea that all the kings sons are dead for only amnon is dead
 but absalom went in flight and the young man who kept the watch lifting up his eyes saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the horons and the watchman came and gave word to the king saying i saw men coming down by the way of the horons from the hillside
 and jonadab said to the king see the kings sons are coming as your servant said so it is
 and while he was talking the kings sons came with weeping and loud cries and the king and all his servants were weeping bitterly
 so absalom went in flight and came to talmai the son of ammihud the king of geshur where he was for three years
 and the king was sorrowing for his son all the time
 and the heart of david was wasted with desire for absalom for he was comforted for the death of amnon
 now it was clear to joab the son of zeruiah that the kings heart was turning to absalom
 and joab sent to tekoa and got from there a wise woman and said to her now make yourself seem like one given up to grief and put on the clothing of sorrow not using any sweet oil for your body but looking like one who for a long time has been weeping for the dead
 and come to the king and say these words to him so joab gave her words to say
 and the woman of tekoa came to the king and falling on her face gave him honour and said give me help o king
 and the king said to her what is your trouble and her answer was truly i am a widow and my husband is dead
 and i had two sons and the two of them had a fight in the field and there was no one to come between them and one with a blow put the other to death
 and now all the family is turned against me your servant saying give up him who was the cause of his brothers death so that we may put him to death in payment for the life of his brother whose life he took and we will put an end to the one who will get the heritage so they will put out my last burning coal and my husband will have no name or offspring on the face of the earth
 and the king said to the woman go to your house and i will give orders about this
 and the woman of tekoa said to the king my lord o king may the sin be on me and on my family and may the king and the seat of his kingdom be clear of sin 
 and the king said if anyone says anything to you make him come to me and he will do you no more damage
 then she said let the king keep in mind the lord your god so that he who gives punishment for blood may be kept back from further destruction and that no one may send death on my son and he said by the living lord not a hair of your sons head will come to the earth
 then the woman said will the king let his servant say one word more and he said say on
 and the woman said why have you had such a thought about the people of god  for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away 
 for death comes to us all and we are like water drained out on the earth which it is not possible to take up again and god will not take away the life of the man whose purpose is that he who has been sent away may not be completely cut off from him
 and now it is my fear of the people which has made me come to say these words to my lord the king and your servant said i will put my cause before the king and it may be that he will give effect to my request
 for the king will give ear and take his servant out of the power of the man whose purpose is the destruction of me and my son together from the heritage of god
 then your servant said may the word of my lord the king give me peace  for my lord the king is as the angel of god in his hearing of good and bad and may the lord your god be with you 
 then the king said to the woman now give me an answer to the question i am going to put to you keep nothing back and the woman said let my lord the king say on
 and the king said is not the hand of joab with you in all this and the woman in answer said by the life of your soul my lord the king it is not possible for anyone to go to the right hand or to the left from anything said by the king your servant joab gave me orders and put all these words in my mouth
 this he did hoping that the face of this business might be changed and my lord is wise with the wisdom of the angel of god having knowledge of everything on earth
 and the king said to joab see now i will do this thing go then and come back with the young man absalom
 then joab falling down on his face on the earth gave the king honour and blessing and joab said today it is clear to your servant that i have grace in your eyes my lord king because the king has given effect to the request of his servant
 so joab got up and went to geshur and came back again to jerusalem with absalom
 and the king said let him go to his house but let him not see my face so absalom went back to his house and did not see the face of the king
 now in all israel there was no one so greatly to be praised for his beautiful form as absalom from his feet to the crown of his head he was completely beautiful
 and when he had his hair cut  which he did at the end of every year because of the weight of his hair  the weight of the hair was two hundred shekels by the kings weight
 and absalom was the father of three sons and of one daughter named tamar who was very beautiful
 for two full years absalom was living in jerusalem without ever seeing the face of the king
 then absalom sent for joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him and he sent again a second time but he would not come
 so he said to his servants see joabs field is near mine and he has barley in it go and put it on fire and absaloms servants put the field on fire
 then joab came to absalom in his house and said to him why have your servants put my field on fire
 and absaloms answer was see i sent to you saying come here so that i may send you to the king to say why have i come back from geshur it would be better for me to be there still let me now see the kings face and if there is any sin in me let him put me to death
 so joab went to the king and said these words to him and when the king had sent for him absalom came and went down on his face on the earth before the king and the king gave him a kiss
 now after this absalom got for himself a carriage and horses and fifty runners to go before him
 and absalom got up early morning after morning and took his place at the side of the public meeting place and when any man had a cause which had to come to the king to be judged then absalom crying out to him said what is your town and he would say your servant is of one of the tribes of israel
 and absalom would say to him see your cause is true and right but no man has been named by the king to give you a hearing
 and more than this absalom said if only i was made judge in the land so that every man who has any cause or question might come to me and i would give a right decision for him 
 and if any man came near to give him honour he took him by the hand and gave him a kiss
 and this absalom did to everyone in israel who came to the king to have his cause judged so absalom like a thief took away the hearts of the men of israel
 now at the end of four years absalom said to the king let me go to hebron and give effect to the oath which i made to the lord
 for while i was living in geshur in aram your servant made an oath saying if ever the lord lets me come back to jerusalem i will give him worship in hebron
 and the king said to him go in peace so he got up and went to hebron
 but absalom at the same time sent watchers through all the tribes of israel to say at the sound of the horn you are to say absalom is king in hebron
 and with absalom at his request went two hundred men from jerusalem who were completely unconscious of his designs
 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite one of davids helpers from giloh his town while he was making the offerings and the design against david became strong for more and more people were joined to absalom
 and one came to david and said the hearts of the men of israel have gone after absalom
 and david said to all his servants who were with him at jerusalem come let us go in flight or not one of us will be safe from absalom let us go without loss of time or he will overtake us quickly and send evil on us and put the town to the sword
 and the kings servants said to the king see your servants are ready to do whatever the king says is to be done
 so the king went out taking with him all the people of his house but for ten of his women who were to take care of the house
 and the king went out and all his servants went after him and made a stop at the far house
 and all the people went on by his side and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the men of ittai of gath six hundred men who came after him from gath went on before the king
 then the king said to ittai the gittite why are you coming with us go back and keep with the king for you are a man of another country you are far from the land of your birth
 it was only yesterday you came to us why then am i to make you go up and down with us for i have to go where i may go back then and take your countrymen with you and may the lords mercy and good faith be with you
 and ittai the gittite in answer said by the living lord and by the life of my lord the king in whatever place my lord the king may be for life or death there will your servant be
 and david said to ittai go forward then and ittai the gittite went on with all his men and all the little ones he had with him
 and there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through and the king himself was waiting in the kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olive tree on the edge of the waste land
 then zadok came and abiathar and with them the ark of gods agreement and they put down the ark of god till all the people from the town had gone by
 and the king said to zadok take the ark of god back into the town if i have grace in the eyes of the lord he will let me come back and see it and his house again
 but if he says i have no delight in you then here i am let him do to me what seems good to him
 the king said further to zadok the priest see you and abiathar are to go back to the town in peace with your two sons ahimaaz your son and jonathan the son of abiathar
 see i will be waiting at the way across the river in the waste land till i get news from you
 so zadok and abiathar took the ark of god back to jerusalem and did not go away from there
 and david went up the slopes of the mount of olives weeping all the way with his head covered and no shoes on his feet and all the people who were with him covering their heads went up weeping
 and word came to david saying ahithophel is among those who are joined to absalom and david said o lord let the wisdom of ahithophel be made foolish
 now when david had come to the top of the slope where they gave worship to god hushai the archite came to him in great grief with dust on his head
 david said to him if you go on with me you will be a trouble to me
 but if you go back to the town and say to absalom i will be your servant o king as in the past i have been your fathers servant so now i will be yours then you will be able to keep ahithophels designs against me from being put into effect
 and have you not there zadok and abiathar the priests so whatever comes to your ears from the kings house give word of it to zadok and abiathar the priests
 see they have with them their two sons ahimaaz zadoks son and jonathan the son of abiathar by them you may send word to me of everything which comes to your ears
 so hushai davids friend went into the town and absalom came to jerusalem
 and when david had gone a little way past the top of the slope ziba the servant of mephibosheth came to him with two asses on which were two hundred cakes of bread and a hundred stems of dry grapes and a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine
 and david said to ziba what is your reason for this and ziba said the asses are for the use of the kings people and the bread and the fruit are food for the young men and the wine is for drink for those who are overcome by weariness in the waste land
 and the king said and where is your masters son and ziba said he is still at jerusalem for he said today israel will give back to me the kingdom of my father
 then the king said to ziba truly everything which was mephibosheths is yours and ziba said i give honour to my lord may i have grace in your eyes my lord o king 
 and when king david came to bahurim a man of sauls family named shimei the son of gera came out from there calling curses after him
 and he sent stones at david and at all the kings servants and at all the people and at all the men of war by his side on the right hand and on the left
 and shimei said with curses be gone be gone you man of blood you good for nothing
 the lord has sent punishment on you for all the blood of the family of saul whose kingdom you have taken and the lord has given the kingdom to absalom your son now you yourself are taken in your evil because you are a man of blood
 then abishai the son of zeruiah said to the king is this dead dog to go on cursing my lord the king let me go over and take off his head
 and the king said what have i to do with you you sons of zeruiah let him go on cursing for the lord has said put a curse on david and who then may say why have you done so
 and david said to abishai and to all his servants you see how my son the offspring of my body has made designs against my life how much more then may this benjamite do so let him be and let him go on cursing for the lord has given him orders
 it may be that the lord will take note of my wrongs and give me back good in answer to his cursing of me today
 so david and his men went on their way and shimei went by the hillside parallel with them cursing and sending stones and dust at him
 and the king and his people came tired to jordan and took their rest there
 and absalom and the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel was with him
 then hushai the archite davids friend came to absalom and said long life to the king long life to the king 
 and absalom said is this your love for your friend why did you not go with your friend
 and hushai said to absalom not so i am for that man whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel have taken as king and i will take my place with him
 and more than this  where is my place as a servant is it not before his son as i have been your fathers servant so will i be yours
 then absalom said to ahithophel give your opinion now what are we to do
 and ahithophel said to absalom go in to your fathers women who are here looking after his house then all israel will have the news that you are hated by your father and the hands of your supporters will be strong
 so they put up the tent for absalom on the top of the house and absalom went in to his fathers women before the eyes of all israel
 in those days the opinions of ahithophel were valued as highly as if through him a man might get direction from god so were they valued by david as much as by absalom
 then ahithophel said to absalom let me take out twelve thousand men and this very night i will go after david
 and i will come up with him when he is tired and feeble and make him full of fear and all the people with him will go in flight and i will make an attack on the king only
 and i will make all the people come back to you as a bride comes back to her husband it is the life of only one man you are going after so all the people will be at peace
 and the saying was pleasing to absalom and to the responsible men of israel
 then absalom said now send for hushai the archite and let us give ear to what he has to say
 and when hushai came absalom said to him this is what ahithophel has said are we to do as he says if not what is your suggestion
 and hushai said to absalom ahithophels idea is not a good one at this time
 hushai said further you have knowledge of your father and his men that they are men of war and that their feelings are bitter like those of a bear in the field whose young ones have been taken from her and your father is a man of war and will not take his nights rest with the people
 but he will certainly have taken cover now in some hole or secret place and if some of our people at the first attack are overcome then any hearing of it will say there is destruction among the people who are on absaloms side
 then even the strongest whose heart is like the heart of a lion will become like water for all israel is conscious that your father is a man of war and those who are with him are strong and without fear
 but my suggestion is that all israel from dan as far as beer sheba comes together to you a great army like the sands of the sea in number and that you yourself go out among them
 then we will come on him in some place wherever he may be falling on him as the dew comes on the earth and of him and all the men who are with him not one will get away with his life
 and if he has gone into some town then let all israel take strong cords to that town and we will have it pulled into the valley till not one small stone is to be seen there
 then absalom and all the men of israel said hushais suggestion is better than that of ahithophel for it was the purpose of the lord to make the wise designs of ahithophel without effect so that the lord might send evil on absalom
 then hushai said to zadok and abiathar the priests this is the suggestion made by ahithophel to absalom and the responsible men of israel and this is what i said to them
 so now send the news quickly to david and say do not take your nights rest by the way across the river to the waste land but be certain to go over or the king and all the people with him will come to destruction
 now jonathan and ahimaaz were waiting by en rogel and a servant girl went from time to time and gave them news and they went with the news to king david for it was not wise for them to let themselves be seen coming into the town
 but a boy saw them and gave word of it to absalom so the two of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man in bahurim who had a water hole in his garden and they went down into it
 and a woman put a cover over the hole and put crushed grain on top of it and no one had any knowledge of it
 and absaloms servants came to the woman at the house and said where are ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said to them they have gone from here to the stream and after searching for them and seeing nothing of them they went back to jerusalem
 then after the servants had gone away they came up out of the water hole and went to give king david the news and they said get up and go quickly over the water for such and such are ahithophels designs against you
 so david and all the people who were with him went up over jordan when dawn came every one of them had gone over jordan
 now when ahithophel saw that his suggestion was not acted on he got his ass ready and went back to his house to the town where he came from and having put his house in order he put himself to death by hanging so he came to his end and was put in the resting place of his father
 and david came to mahanaim and absalom with all the men of israel went over jordan
 and absalom put amasa at the head of the army in place of joab now amasa was the son of a man named ithra the ishmaelite who had been the lover of abigail the daughter of jesse sister of zeruiah joabs mother
 and israel and absalom put up their tents in the land of gilead
 now when david had come to mahanaim shobi the son of nahash of rabbah the ammonite and machir the son of ammiel of lo debar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim
 came with beds and basins and pots and grain and meal and all sorts of dry foods
 and honey and butter and sheep and milk cheeses for david and his people for they said this people is in the waste land needing food and drink and rest
 and david had the people who were with him numbered and he put over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds
 and david sent the people out a third of them under the orders of joab and a third under the orders of abishai son of zeruiah joabs brother and a third under ittai the gittite and the king said to the people and i myself will certainly go out with you
 but the people said it is better for you not to go out for if we are put to flight they will not give a thought to us and if death overtakes half of us it will be nothing to them but you are of more value than ten thousand of us so it is better for you to be ready to come to our help from this town
 and the king said to them i will do whatever seems best to you so the king took his place by the door of the town and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands
 and the king gave orders to joab and abishai and ittai saying because of me be gentle to the young man absalom and this order about absalom was given in the hearing of all the people
 so the people went out into the field against israel and the fight took place in the woods of ephraim
 and the people of israel were overcome there by the servants of david and there was a great destruction that day and twenty thousand men were put to the sword
 and the fighting went on over all the face of the country and the woods were responsible for more deaths than the sword
 and absalom came across some of davids men and absalom was seated on his mule and the mule went under the thick branches of a great tree and his head became fixed in the tree and he was lifted up between earth and heaven and the beast under him went on
 and a certain man saw it and said to joab i saw absalom hanging in a tree
 and joab said to the man who had given him the news if you saw this why did you not put your sword through him and i would have given you ten bits of silver and a band for your robe
 and the man said to joab even if you gave me a thousand bits of silver i would not put out my hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king gave orders to you and abishai and ittai saying take care that the young man absalom is not touched
 and if i had falsely put him to death  and nothing may be kept secret from the king  you would have had nothing to do with me
 then joab said i would have made it safe for you and he took three spears in his hand and put them through absaloms heart while he was still living in the branches of the tree
 and ten young men servants of joab came round absalom and put an end to him
 and joab had the horn sounded and the people came back from going after israel for joab kept them back
 and they took absaloms body and put it into a great hole in the wood and put a great mass of stones over it and every man of israel went in flight to his tent
 now absalom before his death had put up for himself a pillar in the kings valley naming it after himself for he said i have no son to keep my name in memory and to this day it is named absaloms pillar
 then ahimaaz the son of zadok said let me go and give the king news of how the lord has done right in his cause against those who took up arms against him
 and joab said you will take no news today another day you may give him the news but you will take no news today because the kings son is dead
 then joab said to the cushite go and give the king word of what you have seen and the cushite making a sign of respect to joab went off running
 then ahimaaz the son of zadok said to joab again whatever may come of it let me go after the cushite and joab said why have you a desire to go my son seeing that you will get no reward for your news
 whatever may come of it he said i will go then he said to him go so ahimaaz went running by the lowland road and overtook the cushite
 now david was seated between the two town doors and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways on the wall and lifting up his eyes saw a man running by himself
 and the watchman gave news of it to the king and the king said if he is coming by himself then he has news and the man was travelling quickly and came near
 then the watchman saw another man running and crying out in the direction of the door he said here is another man running by himself and the king said he like the other comes with news
 and the watchman said it seems to me that the running of the first is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and his news will be good
 and ahimaaz crying out to the king said it is well and falling down before the king with his face to the earth he said may the lord your god be praised who has given up the men who took up arms against my lord the king 
 and the king said is it well with the young man absalom and ahimaaz said in answer when joab sent me your servant i saw a great outcry going on but i had no knowledge of what it was
 and the king said get back and take your place here so turning to one side he took his place there
 and then the cushite came and said i have news for my lord the king today the lord has done right in your cause against all those who took up arms against you
 and the king said to the cushite is the young man absalom safe and the cushite said in answer may all the kings haters and those who do evil against the king be as that young man is 
 then the king was much moved and went up into the room over the door weeping and saying o my son absalom my son my son absalom  if only my life might have been given for yours o absalom my son my son 
 and word was given to joab that the king was weeping and sorrowing for absalom
 and the salvation of that day was changed to sorrow for all the people for it was said to the people the king is in bitter grief for his son
 and the people made their way back to the town quietly and secretly as those who are shamed go secretly when they go in flight from the war
 but the king covering his face gave a great cry o my son absalom o absalom my son my son 
 and joab came into the house to the king and said today you have put to shame the faces of all your servants who even now have kept you and your sons and your daughters and your wives and all your women safe from death
 for your haters it seems are dear to you and your friends are hated for you have made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you and now i see that if absalom was living and we had all been dead today it would have been right in your eyes
 so get up now and go out and say some kind words to your servants for by the lord i give you my oath that if you do not go out not one of them will keep with you tonight and that will be worse for you than all the evil which has overtaken you from your earliest years
 then the king got up and took his seat near the town door and word was given to all the people that the king was in the public place and all the people came before the king now all the men of israel had gone back in flight to their tents
 and through all the tribes of israel the people were having arguments saying the king made us safe from the hands of those who were against us and made us free from the hands of the philistines and now he has gone in flight from the land because of absalom
 and absalom whom we made a ruler over us is dead in the fight so now why do you say nothing about getting the king back and word of what all israel was saying came to the king
 and king david sent word to zadok and abiathar the priests say to the responsible men of judah why are you the last to take steps to get the king back to his house
 you are my brothers my bone and my flesh why are you the last to get the king back again
 and say to amasa are you not my bone and my flesh may gods punishment be on me if i do not make you chief of the army before me at all times in place of joab 
 and the hearts of the men of judah were moved like one man so that they sent to the king saying come back with all your servants
 so the king came back and came as far as jordan and judah came to gilgal meeting the king there to take him back with them over jordan
 and shimei the son of gera the benjamite from bahurim got up quickly and went down with the men of judah for the purpose of meeting king david
 and with him a thousand men of benjamin and ziba the servant of saul with his fifteen sons and twenty servants came rushing to jordan before the king
 and kept going across the river to take the people of the kings house over and to do whatever was desired by the king and shimei the son of gera went down on his face in the dust before the king when he was about to go over jordan
 and said to him let me not be judged as a sinner in your eyes o my lord and do not keep in mind the wrong i did on the day when my lord the king went out of jerusalem or take it to heart
 for your servant is conscious of his sin and so as you see i have come today the first of all the sons of joseph for the purpose of meeting my lord the king
 but abishai the son of zeruiah said is not death the right fate for shimei because he has been cursing the one marked by the holy oil
 and david said what have i to do with you you sons of zeruiah that you put yourselves against me today is it right for any man in israel to be put to death today for i am certain today that i am king in israel
 so the king said to shimei you will not be put to death and the king gave him his oath
 and mephibosheth the son of sauls son came down for the purpose of meeting the king his feet had not been cared for or his hair cut or his clothing washed from the day when the king went away till the day when he came back in peace
 now when he had come from jerusalem to see the king the king said to him why did you not come with me mephibosheth
 and he said in answer because of the deceit of my servant my lord king for i your servant said to him you are to make ready an ass and on it i will go with the king for your servant has not the use of his feet
 he has given you a false account of me but my lord the king is like the angel of god do then whatever seems good to you
 for all my fathers family were only dead men before my lord the king and still you put your servant among those whose place is at the kings table what right then have i to say anything more to the king
 and the king said say nothing more about these things i say let there be a division of the land between ziba and you
 and mephibosheth said let him take it all now that my lord the king has come back to his house in peace 
 and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and he went on as far as jordan with the king to take him across jordan
 now barzillai was a very old man as much as eighty years old and he had given the king everything he had need of while he was at mahanaim for he was a very great man
 and the king said to barzillai come over with me and i will take care of you in jerusalem
 and barzillai said to the king how much of my life is still before me for me to go up to jerusalem with the king
 i am now eighty years old good and bad are the same to me have meat and drink any taste for me now am i able to take pleasure in the voices of men or women in song why then am i to be a trouble to my lord the king
 your servants desire was only to take the king over jordan why is the king to give me such a reward
 let your servant now go back again so that when death comes to me it may be in my town and by the resting place of my father and mother but here is your servant chimham let him go with my lord the king and do for him what seems good to you
 and the king said in answer let chimham go over with me and i will do for him whatever seems good to you and whatever your desire is i will do it for you
 then all the people went over jordan and the king went over and the king gave barzillai a kiss with his blessing and he went back to his place
 so the king went over to gilgal and chimham went with him and all the people of judah as well as half the people of israel took the king on his way
 then the men of israel came to the king and said why have our countrymen of judah taken you away in secret and come over jordan with the king and all his family because all his people are davids men
 and all the men of judah gave this answer to the men of israel because the king is our near relation why then are you angry about this have we taken any of the kings food or has he given us any offering
 and in answer to the men of judah the men of israel said we have ten parts in the king and we are the first in order of birth why did you make nothing of us and were we not the first to make suggestions for getting the king back and the words of the men of judah were more violent than the words of the men of israel
 now after this david questioning the lord said am i to go up into any of the towns of judah and the lord said to him go up and david said where am i to go and he said to hebron
 so david went there taking with him his two wives ahinoam of jezreel and abigail the wife of nabal of carmel
 and david took all his men with him every man with his family and they were living in the towns round hebron
 and the men of judah came there and with the holy oil made david king over the people of judah and word came to david that it was the men of jabesh gilead who put sauls body in its last resting place
 and david sent to the men of jabesh gilead and said to them may the lord give you his blessing because you have done this kind act to saul your lord and have put his body to rest 
 may the lord be good and true to you and i myself will see that your kind act is rewarded because you have done this thing
 then let your hands be strong and have no fear though saul your lord is dead the people of judah have made me their king
 now abner the son of ner captain of sauls army had taken sauls son ish bosheth over to mahanaim
 and made him king over gilead and the asherites and over jezreel and ephraim and benjamin that is over all israel
  sauls son ish bosheth was forty years old when he became king over israel and he was ruler for two years  but judah was on the side of david
 and the time when david was king in hebron over the people of judah was seven years and six months
 and abner the son of ner with the servants of sauls son ish bosheth went out from mahanaim to gibeon
 and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and came face to face with them by the pool of gibeon and they took up their position facing one another on opposite sides of the pool
 and abner said to joab let the young men give a test of their strength before us and joab said let them do so
 so they got up and went over by number twelve for benjamin and ish bosheth and twelve of the servants of david
 and every one got the other by the head driving his sword into the others side so they all went down together and that place was named the field of sides and it is in gibeon
 and there was hard fighting that day and abner and the men of israel gave way before the servants of david
 there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as quick footed as a roe of the fields
 asahel went running after abner not turning to the right or to the left
 then abner looking back said is it you asahel and he said it is i
 and abner said then go to the right or to the left and put your hands on one of the fighting men and take his arms but asahel would not be turned away from going after abner
 then again abner said to asahel go to one side do not keep on coming after me why will you make me put an end to you for then i will be shamed before your brother joab
 but still he did not go to one side so abner gave him a back blow in the stomach with his spear so that the spear came out at his back and he went down on the earth wounded to death and all those who came to the place where asahel went down dead came to a stop
 but joab and abishai went after abner and the sun went down when they came to the hill of ammah which is to the east of the road through the waste land of geba
 and the men of benjamin came together after abner in one band and took their places on the top of a hill
 then crying out to joab abner said are fighting and destruction to go on for ever do you not see that the end will only be bitter how long will it be before you send the people back and make them give up attacking their countrymen
 and joab said by the living god if you had not given the word the people would have gone on attacking their countrymen till the morning
 so joab had a horn sounded and all the people came to a stop and gave up going after israel and fighting them
 and all that night abner and his men went through the arabah they went over jordan and through all bithron and came to mahanaim
 and joab came back from fighting abner and when he had got all his men together it was seen that nineteen of davids men in addition to asahel were not with them
 but davids men had put to death three hundred and sixty of the men of benjamin and of abners men
 and they took asahels body and put it in the last resting place of his father in beth lehem and joab and his men travelling all night came to hebron at dawn
 now by chance there was present a good for nothing person named sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he sounding the horn said we have no part in david or any interest in the son of jesse let every man go to his tent o israel
 so all the men of israel turning away from david went after sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah were true to their king going with him from jordan as far as jerusalem
 and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house and had them shut up and gave them the necessaries of life but did not go near them so they were shut up till the day of their death living as widows
 then the king said to amasa get all the men of judah together and in three days be here yourself
 so amasa went to get all the men of judah together but he took longer than the time david had given him
 and david said to abishai sheba the son of bichri will do us more damage than absalom did so take some of your lords servants and go after him before he makes himself safe in the walled towns and gets away before our eyes
 so there went after abishai joab and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the fighting men they went out of jerusalem to overtake sheba the son of bichri
 when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa came face to face with them now joab had on his war dress and round him a band from which his sword was hanging in its cover and while he was walking it came out falling to the earth
 and joab said to amasa is it well my brother and with his right hand he took him by the hair of his chin to give him a kiss
 but amasa did not see danger from the sword which was now in joabs left hand and joab put it through his stomach so that his inside came out on to the earth and he did not give him another blow so joab and his brother abishai went on after sheba the son of bichri
 and one of joabs young men taking his place at amasas side said whoever is for joab and for david let him go after joab 
 and amasa was stretched out in a pool of blood in the middle of the highway and when the man saw that all the people were stopping he took amasa out of the highway and put him in a field with a cloth over him when he saw that everyone who went by came to a stop
 when he had been taken off the road all the people went on after joab in search of sheba the son of bichri
 and sheba went through all the tribes of israel to abel of beth maacah and all the bichrites came together and went in after him
 and joab and his men got him shut up in abel of beth maacah and put up an earthwork against the town and all joabs men did their best to get the wall broken down
 then a wise woman got up on the wall and crying out from the town said give ear give ear say now to joab come near so that i may have talk with you
 and he came near and the woman said are you joab and he said in answer i am then she said give ear to your servants words and he said i am giving ear
 then she said in the old days there was a saying let them put the question in abel and in dan saying has what was ordered by men of good faith in israel ever come to an end
 your purpose is the destruction of a mother town in israel why would you put an end to the heritage of the lord
 and joab answering her said far far be it from me to be a cause of death or destruction
 not so but a man of the hill country of ephraim sheba son of bichri by name has taken up arms against the king against david give up this man only and i will go away from the town and the woman said to joab his head will be dropped over the wall to you
 then the woman in her wisdom had talk with all the town and they had shebas head cut off and sent out to joab and he had the horn sounded and sent them all away from the town every man to his tent and joab went back to jerusalem to the king
 now joab was over all the army and benaiah the son of jehoiada was at the head of the cherethites and the pelethites
 and adoram was overseer of the forced work and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was the recorder
 and sheva was the scribe and zadok and abiathar were priests
 and in addition ira the jairite was a priest to david
 in the days of david they were short of food for three years year after year and david went before the lord for directions and the lord said on saul and on his family there is blood because he put the gibeonites to death
 then the king sent for the gibeonites  now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but were the last of the amorites to whom the children of israel had given an oath but saul in his passion for the children of israel and judah had made an attempt on their lives 
 so david said to the gibeonites what may i do for you how am i to make up to you for your wrongs so that you may give a blessing to the heritage of the lord
 and the gibeonites said to him it is not a question of silver and gold between us and saul or his family and it is not in our power to put to death any man in israel and he said say then what am i to do for you
 and they said to the king as for the man by whom we were wasted and who made designs against us to have us completely cut off from the land of israel
 let seven men of his family be given up to us and we will put an end to them by hanging them before the lord in gibeon on the hill of the lord and the king said i will give them
 but the king did not give up mephibosheth the son of sauls son jonathan because of the lords oath made between david and jonathan the son of saul
 but the king took armoni and mephibosheth the two sons of saul to whom rizpah the daughter of aiah had given birth and the five sons of sauls daughter merab whose father was adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite
 and he gave them up to the gibeonites and they put them to death hanging them on the mountain before the lord all seven came to their end together in the first days of the grain cutting at the start of the cutting of the barley
 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took haircloth placing it on the rock as a bed for herself from the start of the grain cutting till rain came down on them from heaven and she did not let the birds of the air come near them by day or the beasts of the field by night
 and news was given to david of what rizpah the daughter of aiah one of sauls wives had done
 and david went and took the bones of saul and his son jonathan from the men of jabesh gilead who had taken them away secretly from the public place of beth shan where the philistines had put them hanging up the bodies there on the day when they put saul to death in gilboa
 and he took the bones of saul and his son jonathan from that place and they got together the bones of those who had been put to death by hanging
 and they put them with the bones of saul and his son jonathan in the resting place of kish his father in zela in the country of benjamin they did all the king had given them orders to do and after that god gave ear to their prayers for the land
 and the philistines went to war again with israel and david went down with his people and while they were at gob they had a fight with the philistines
 and there came against david one of the offspring of the rephaim whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight and having a new sword he made an attempt to put david to death
 but abishai the son of zeruiah came to his help and turning on the philistine gave him his death blow then davids men took an oath and said never again are you to go out with us to the fight so that you may not put out the light of israel
 now after this there was war with the philistines again at gob and sibbecai the hushathite put to death saph one of the offspring of the rephaim
 and again there was war with the philistines at gob and elhanan the son of jair the beth lehemite put to death goliath the gittite the stem of whose spear was like a cloth workers rod
 and again there was war at gath where there was a very tall man who had twenty four fingers and toes six fingers on his hands and six toes on his feet he was one of the offspring of the rephaim
 and when he was purposing to put shame on israel jonathan the son of shimei davids brother put him to death
 these four were of the offspring of the rephaim in gath and they came to their end by the hands of david and his servants
 and david made a song to the lord in these words on the day when the lord made him free from the hands of all his haters and from the hand of saul
 and he said the lord is my rock my walled town and my saviour even mine
 my god my rock in him will i put my faith my breastplate and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my safe place my saviour who keeps me safe from the violent man
 i will send up my cry to the lord who is to be praised so will i be made safe from those who are against me
 for the waves of death came round me and the seas of evil put me in fear
 the cords of hell were round me the nets of death came on me
 in my trouble my voice went up to the lord and my cry to my god my voice came to his hearing in his holy temple and my prayer came to his ears
 then the earth was moved with a violent shock the bases of heaven were moved and shaking because he was angry
 there went up a smoke from his nose and a fire of destruction from his mouth coals were lighted by it
 the heavens were bent so that he might come down and it was dark under his feet
 and he went through the air seated on a storm cloud going quickly on the wings of the wind
 and he made the dark his tent round him a mass of waters thick clouds of the skies
 before his shining light his dark clouds went past raining ice and coals of fire
 the lord made thunder in the heavens and the voice of the highest was sounding out
 and he sent out his arrows driving them in all directions by his flames of fire they were troubled
 then the deep beds of the sea were seen and the bases of the world were uncovered because of the lords wrath because of the breath of his mouth
 he sent from on high he took me pulling me out of great waters
 he made me free from my strong hater from those who were against me because they were stronger than i
 they came on me in the day of my trouble but the lord was my support
 he took me out into a wide place he was my saviour because he had delight in me
 the lord gives me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean before him
 for i have kept the ways of the lord i have not been turned away in sin from my god
 for all his decisions were before me and i did not put away his laws from me
 and i was upright before him and i kept myself from sin
 because of this the lord has given me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean in his eyes
 on him who has mercy you will have mercy to the upright you will be upright
 he who is holy will see that you are holy but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge
 for you are the saviour of those who are in trouble but your eyes are on men of pride to make them low
 for you are my light o lord and the lord will make the dark bright for me
 by your help i have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in by the help of my god i have gone over a wall
 as for god his way is all good the word of the lord is tested he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him
 for who is god but the lord and who is a rock but our god
 god puts a strong band about me guiding me in a straight way
 he makes my feet like roes feet and puts me on high places
 he makes my hands expert in war so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms
 you have given me the breastplate of your salvation and your mercy has made me great
 you have made my steps wide under me so that my feet make no slip
 i go after my haters and overtake them not turning back till they are all overcome
 i have sent destruction on them and given them wounds so that they are not able to get up they are stretched under my feet
 for i have been armed by you with strength for the fight you have made low under me those who came out against me
 by you their backs are turned in flight so that my haters are cut off
 they were crying out but there was no one to come to their help even to the lord but he gave them no answer
 then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets
 you have made me free from the fightings of my people you have made me the head of the nations a people of whom i had no knowledge will be my servants
 men of other countries will with false hearts put themselves under my authority from the time when my name comes to their ears they will be ruled by me
 they will be wasted away they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear
 the lord is living praise be to my rock and let the god of my salvation be honoured
 it is god who sends punishment on my haters and puts peoples under my rule
 he makes me free from my haters i am lifted up over those who come up against me you have made me free from the violent man
 because of this i will give you praise o lord among the nations and will make a song of praise to your name
 great salvation does he give to his king he has mercy on the king of his selection david and on his seed for ever
 now these are the last words of david david the son of jesse says the man who was lifted up on high the man on whom the god of jacob put the holy oil the loved one of israels songs says
 the spirit of the lord had voice through me his word was on my tongue
 the god of israel said the word of the rock of israel came to me when an upright king is ruling over men when he is ruling in the fear of god
 it is as the light of the morning when the sun comes up a morning without clouds making young grass come to life from the earth
 for is not my house so with god for he has made with me an eternal agreement ordered in all things and certain as for all my salvation and all my desire will he not give it increase
 but the evil doers all of them will be like thorns to be pushed away because they may not be gripped in the hand
 but anyone touching them has to be armed with iron and the rod of a spear and they will be burned with fire every one of them
 these are the names of davids men of war ishbaal the hachmonite chief of the three his axe was lifted up against eight hundred put to death at one time
 after him was eleazar the son of dodai the ahohite one of the three great fighters who was with david in pas dammim when the philistines came together there for the fight and when the men of israel had gone in flight
 he was with david and went on fighting the philistines till his hand became tired and stiff from gripping his sword and that day the lord gave a great salvation and the people came back after him only to take the goods of the philistines
 after him was shammah the son of ela the hararite and the philistines came together in lehi where there was a bit of land full of seed and the people went in flight from the philistines
 but he kept his place in the middle of the bit of land and kept back their attack and overcame the philistines and the lord gave a great salvation
 and three of the thirty went down at the start of the grain cutting and they came to david at the strong place of adullam and the band of philistines had taken up their position in the valley of rephaim
 and at that time david had taken cover in the strong place and an armed force of the philistines was in beth lehem
 and david moved by a strong desire said if only someone would give me a drink of water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town 
 and the three men forcing their way through the philistine army got water from the water hole of beth lehem by the doorway into the town and took it back to david but he would not take it but draining it out made an offering of it to the lord
 and he said far be it from me o lord to do this how may i take as my drink the life blood of men who have put their lives in danger so he would not take it these things did the three great men of war
 and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief of the thirty he put to death three hundred with his spear and he got for himself a name among the thirty
 was he not the noblest of the thirty so he was made their captain but he was not equal to the first three
 and benaiah the son of jehoiada a fighting man of kabzeel had done great acts he put to death the two sons of ariel of moab he went down into a hole and put a lion to death in time of snow
 and he made an attack on an egyptian a tall man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a stick and pulling the spear out of the hands of the egyptian put him to death with that same spear
 these were the acts of benaiah the son of jehoiada who had a great name among the thirty men of war
 he was honoured over the rest of the thirty but he was not equal to the first three and david put him over the fighting men who kept him safe
 asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty and elhanan the son of dodai of beth lehem
 shammah the harodite elika the harodite
 helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite
 abiezer the anathothite sibbecai the hushathite
 zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite
 heldai the son of baanah the netophathite ittai the son of ribai of gibeah of the children of benjamin
 benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the valleys of gaash
 abiel the arbathite azmaveth of bahurim
 eliahba the shaalbonite jashen the gunite
 jonathan the son of shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite
 eliphelet the son of ahasbai the maacathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite
 hezrai the carmelite paarai the archite
 igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite
 zelek the ammonite naharai the beerothite who had the care of the arms of joab son of zeruiah
 ira the ithrite gareb the ithrite
 uriah the hittite thirty seven in number
 again the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and moving david against them he said go take the number of israel and judah
 and the king said to joab and the captains of the army who were with him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan as far as beer sheba and have all the people numbered so that i may be certain of the number of the people
 and joab said to the king whatever the number of the people may the lord make it a hundred times as much and may the eyes of my lord the king see it but why does my lord the king take pleasure in doing this thing
 but the kings order was stronger than joab and the captains of the army and joab and the captains of the army went out from the king to take the number of the children of israel
 and they went over jordan and starting from aroer from the town which is in the middle of the valley they went in the direction of the gadites and on to jazer
 then they came to gilead and to the land of the hittites under hermon and they came to dan and from dan they came round to zidon
 and to the walled town of tyre and to all the towns of the hivites and the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah at beer sheba
 so after going through all the land in every direction they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
 and joab gave the king the number of all the people there were in israel eight hundred thousand fighting men able to take up arms and the men of judah were five hundred thousand
 and after the people had been numbered davids heart was troubled and david said to the lord great has been my sin in doing this but now o lord be pleased to take away the sin of your servant for i have done very foolishly
 and david got up in the morning now the word of the lord had come to the prophet gad davids seer saying
 go and say to david the lord says three things are offered to you say which of them you will have and i will do it to you
 so gad came to david and gave him word of this and said to him are there to be three years when there is not enough food in your land or will you go in flight from your haters for three months while they go after you or will you have three days of violent disease in your land take thought and say what answer i am to give to him who sent me
 and david said to gad this is a hard decision for me to make let us come into the hands of the lord for great are his mercies let me not come into the hands of men
 so david made selection of the disease and the time was the days of the grain cutting when the disease came among the people causing the death of seventy thousand men from dan as far as beer sheba
 and when the hand of the angel was stretched out in the direction of jerusalem for its destruction the lord had regret for the evil and said to the angel who was sending destruction on the people it is enough do no more and the angel of the lord was by the grain floor of araunah the jebusite
 and when david saw the angel who was causing the destruction of the people he said to the lord truly the sin is mine i have done wrong but these are only sheep what have they done let your hand be against me and against my family
 and that day gad came to david and said to him go up and put up an altar to the lord on the grain floor of araunah the jebusite
 so david went up as gad had said and as the lord had given orders
 and araunah looking out saw the king and his servants coming to him and araunah went out and went down on his face to the earth before the king
 and araunah said why has my lord the king come to his servant and david said to give you a price for your grain floor so that i may put up an altar to the lord and the disease may be stopped among the people
 and araunah said to david let my lord the king take whatever seems right to him and make an offering of it see here are the oxen for the burned offering and the grain cleaning instruments and the ox yokes for wood
 all this does the servant of my lord the king give to the king and araunah said may the lord your god be pleased with your offering 
 and the king said to araunah no but i will give you a price for it i will not give to the lord my god burned offerings for which i have given nothing so david got the grain floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
 and there david put up an altar to the lord making burned offerings and peace offerings so the lord gave ear to his prayer for the land and the disease came to an end in israel
 now there was a long war between sauls people and davids people and david became stronger and stronger but those on sauls side became more and more feeble
 while david was in hebron he became the father of sons the oldest was amnon son of ahinoam of jezreel
 and the second chileab whose mother was abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur
 and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital
 and the sixth ithream whose mother was davids wife eglah these were the sons of david whose birth took place in hebron
 now while there was war between sauls people and davids people abner was making himself strong among the supporters of saul
 now saul had among his wives a woman named rizpah the daughter of aiah and ish bosheth said to abner why have you taken my fathers wife
 and abner was very angry at the words of ish bosheth and he said am i a dogs head of judah i am this day doing all in my power for the cause of your father saul and for his brothers and his friends and have not given you up into the hands of david and now you say i have done wrong with a woman
 may gods punishment be on abner if i do not for david as the lord in his oath has said
 and if i do not take away the kingdom from the family of saul and make david ruler over israel and judah from dan as far as beer sheba 
 and so great was ish bosheths fear of abner that he was not able to say a word in answer
 and abner sent men to david at hebron saying make an agreement with me and i will give you my support in getting all israel on your side
 and he said it is well i will make an agreement with you but on one condition which is that when you come before me sauls daughter michal is to come with you till she comes you will not see my face
 and david sent men to sauls son ish bosheth saying give me back michal my wife whom i made mine for the price of the private parts of a hundred philistines
 so ish bosheth sent and took her from her husband paltiel the son of laish
 and her husband went with her as far as bahurim weeping while he went then abner said to him go back and he went back
 then abner had a talk with the chief men of israel saying in the past it was your desire to make david your king so now do it
 for the lord has said of david by the hand of my servant david i will make my people israel safe from the philistines and from all who are against them
 and abner said the same things to benjamin and he went to david in hebron to make clear to him what seemed good to israel and to all the people of benjamin
 so abner with twenty men came to hebron to david and david made a feast for abner and the men who were with him
 and abner said to david now i will go and make all israel come to my lord the king so that they may make an agreement with you and your kingdom may be as wide as your hearts desire then david sent abner away and he went in peace
 now the servants of david and joab had been out attacking a band of armed men and they came back with a great store of goods taken in the fight but abner was no longer in hebron with david for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace
 when joab and his men came news was given them that abner the son of ner had come to the king who had let him go away again in peace
 then joab came to the king and said what have you done when abner came to you why did you send him away and let him go
 is it not clear to you that abner the son of ner came with deceit to get knowledge of your going out and your coming in and of all you are doing
 and when joab had come out from david he sent men after abner and they overtook him at the water spring of sirah and made him come back with them but david had no knowledge of it
 and when abner was back in hebron joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly and there he gave him a wound in the stomach causing his death in payment for the death of his brother asahel
 and when david had word of it he said may i and my kingdom be clear for ever in the eyes of the lord from the blood of abner the son of ner
 may it come on the head of joab and all his fathers family among the men of joabs family may there ever be some who are diseased or lepers or who do the work of women or are put to the sword or are wasted from need of food 
 so joab and abishai his brother put abner to death because he had put to death their brother asahel in the fight at gibeon
 and david said to joab and all the people who were with him go in grief and put haircloth about you in sorrow for abner and king david went after the dead body
 and they put abners body to rest in hebron and the king and all the people were weeping loudly by the resting place of abners body
 and the king made a song of grief for abner and said was the death of abner to be like the death of a foolish man
 your hands were free your feet were not chained like the downfall of a man before evil men so was your fall and the weeping of the people over him went on again
 and the people came to make david take food while it was still day but david with an oath said may gods punishment be on me if i take a taste of bread or any other thing till the sun has gone down 
 and all the people took note of it and were pleased like everything the king did it was pleasing to the people
 so it was clear to israel and to all the people on that day that the king was not responsible for the death of abner the son of ner
 and the king said to his servants do you not see that a chief and a great man has come to his end today in israel
 while i though i am crowned king have little strength and these men the sons of zeruiah are out of my control may the lord give to the evil doer the reward of his evil doing 
 and when sauls son ish bosheth had news that abner was dead in hebron his hands became feeble and all the israelites were troubled
 and sauls son had two men captains of bands one named baanah and the other rechab sons of rimmon the beerothite of the tribe of benjamin  for beeroth was at one time taken to be part of benjamin
 but the people of beeroth had gone in flight to gittaim where they have been living to this day 
 now jonathan sauls son had a son whose feet were damaged he was five years old when news of the death of saul and jonathan came from jezreel and the woman who took care of him took him up and went in flight and while she was getting him away as quickly as she was able he had a fall and his feet were damaged his name was mephibosheth
 and rechab and baanah the sons of rimmon the beerothite went out and came to the house of ish bosheth in the heat of the day when he was resting in the middle of the day now the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain and sleep overcame her
 and rechab and his brother baanah got in without being seen
 and when they came into the house ish bosheth was stretched on his bed in his bedroom and they made an attack on him and put him to death and cutting off his head they took it with them and went by the road through the arabah all night
 and they took the head of ish bosheth to david in hebron and said to the king here is the head of ish bosheth the son of saul your hater who would have taken your life the lord has taken payment for the wrongs of my lord the king from saul and his seed today
 and david made answer to rechab and his brother baanah the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said to them by the living lord who has kept me safe from all my trouble
 when one came to me with the news of sauls death in the belief that it would be good news i took him and put him to death in ziklag which was the reward i gave him for his news
 how much more when evil men have put an upright person to death in his house sleeping on his bed will i take payment from you for his blood and have you cut off from the earth
 and david gave orders to his young men and they put them to death cutting off their hands and their feet and hanging them up by the side of the pool in hebron but they took the head of ish bosheth and put it in its last resting place with abners body in hebron
 then all the tribes of israel came to david in hebron and said truly we are your bone and your flesh
 in the past when saul was king over us it was you who went at the head of israel when they went out or came in and the lord said to you you are to be the keeper of my people israel and their ruler
 so all the responsible men of israel came to the king at hebron and king david made an agreement with them in hebron before the lord and they put the holy oil on david and made him king over israel
 david was thirty years old when he became king and he was king for forty years
 ruling over judah in hebron for seven years and six months and in jerusalem over all israel and judah for thirty three years
 and the king and his men went to jerusalem against the jebusites the people of the land and they said to david you will not come in here but the blind and the feeble footed will keep you out for they said david will not be able to come in here
 but david took the strong place of zion which is the town of david
 and that day david said whoever makes an attack on the jebusites let him go up by the water pipe and put to death all the blind and feeble footed who are hated by david and this is why they say the blind and feeble footed may not come into the house
 so david took the strong tower for his living place naming it the town of david and david took in hand the building of the town all round starting from the millo
 and david became greater and greater for the lord the god of armies was with him
 and hiram king of tyre sent men to david with cedar trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers and they made david a house
 and david saw that the lord had made his position safe as king over israel and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people israel
 and david took more women and wives in jerusalem after he had come from hebron and he had more sons and daughters
 these are the names of those whose birth took place in jerusalem shammua and shobab and nathan and solomon
 and ibhar and elishua and nepheg and japhia
 and elishama and eliada and eliphelet
 and when the philistines had news that david had been made king over israel they all went up in search of david and david hearing of it went down to the strong place
 and when the philistines came they went in every direction in the valley of rephaim
 and david desiring directions from the lord said am i to go up against the philistines will you give them up into my hands and the lord said go up for i will certainly give up the philistines into your hands
 and david went to baal perazim and overcame them there and he said the lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters so that place was named baal perazim
 and the philistines when they went in flight did not take their images with them and david and his men took them away
 and the philistines came up again and went in every direction in the valley of rephaim
 and when david went for directions to the lord he said you are not to go up against them in front but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice trees
 then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees go forward quickly for the lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the philistines
 and david did as the lord had said and he overcame the philistines attacking them from gibeon to near gezer
 and david got together all the fighting men of israel to the number of thirty thousand
 and david and all the people who were with him went to baal of judah to get the ark of god over which the holy name is named the name of the lord of armies whose place is between the winged ones
 and they put the ark of god on a new cart and took it out of the house of abinadab which was on the hill and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab were the drivers of the cart
 and uzzah went by the side of the ark while ahio went before it
 and david and all the men of israel made melody before the lord with all their power with songs and with corded instruments and instruments of brass
 and when they came to nacons grain floor uzzah put his hand on the ark of god to keep it safe in its place for the oxen were out of control
 and the wrath of the lord burning against uzzah sent destruction on him because he had put his hand on the ark and death came to him there by the ark of god
 and david was angry because of the lords outburst of wrath against uzzah and he gave that place the name perez uzzah which is its name to this day
 and such was davids fear of the lord that day that he said how may i let the ark of god come to me
 so david did not let the ark of the lord come back to him to the town of david but had it turned away and put into the house of obed edom the gittite
 and the ark of the lord was in the house of obed edom the gittite for three months and the lord sent a blessing on obed edom and all his family
 and they said to king david the blessing of the lord is on the family of obed edom and on all he has because of the ark of god and david went and took the ark of god from the house of obed edom into the town of david with joy
 and when those who were lifting the ark of the lord had gone six steps he made an offering of an ox and a fat young beast
 and david clothed in a linen ephod was dancing before the lord with all his strength
 so david and all the men of israel took up the ark of the lord with cries of joy and sounding of horns
 and when the ark of the lord came into the town of david michal sauls daughter looking out of the window saw king david dancing and jumping before the lord and to her mind he seemed foolish
 and they took in the ark of the lord and put it in its place inside the tent which david had put up for it and david made burned offerings and peace offerings to the lord
 and after david had made the burned offerings and the peace offerings he gave the people a blessing in the name of the lord of armies
 and he gave to every man and woman among all the people among all the masses of israel a cake of bread and a measure of wine and a cake of dry grapes then all the people went away every man to his house
 then david came back to give a blessing to his family and michal sauls daughter came out to him and said how full of glory was the king of israel today who let himself be seen uncovered by his servant girls like a foolish person uncovering himself without shame 
 and david said to michal i was dancing before the lord who put me over your father and all his sons to make me a ruler over the people of the lord over his people israel and i will go on playing before the lord
 and i will do even worse than this and make myself even lower in your eyes but the servant girls of whom you were talking will give me honour
 and michal sauls daughter had no child till the day of her death
 now when the king was living in his house and the lord had given him rest from war on every side
 the king said to nathan the prophet see now i am living in a house of cedar but the ark of god is housed inside the curtains of a tent
 and nathan said to the king go and do whatever is in your heart for the lord is with you
 now that night the word of the lord came to nathan saying
 go and say to my servant david the lord says are you to be the builder of a house a living place for me
 for from the day when i took the children of israel up out of egypt till this day i have had no house but have gone from place to place in a tent
 in all the places where i went with all the children of israel did i ever say to any of the judges of israel to whom i gave the care of my people israel why have you not made me a house of cedar
 then say these words to my servant david the lord of armies says i took you from the fields from keeping the sheep so that you might be a ruler over my people over my people israel
 and i have been with you wherever you went cutting off before you all those who were against you and i will make your name great like the name of the greatest ones of the earth
 and i will make a resting place for my people israel planting them there so that they may be living in the place which is theirs and never again be moved and never again will they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first
 from the time when i put judges over my people israel and i will give you peace from all who are against you and the lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings
 and when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers i will put in your place your seed after you the offspring of your body and i will make his kingdom strong
 he will be the builder of a house for my name and i will make the seat of his authority certain for ever
 i will be to him a father and he will be to me a son if he does wrong i will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men
 but my mercy will not be taken away from him as i took it from him who was before you
 and your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever the seat of your authority will never be overturned
 so nathan gave david an account of all these words and this vision
 then david the king went in and took his seat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is my family that you have been my guide till now
 and this was only a small thing to you o lord god but your words have even been about the far off future of your servants family o lord god 
 what more may david say to you for you have knowledge of your servant o lord god
 because of your word and from your heart you have done all this great work and let your servant see it
 truly you are great o lord god there is no one like you and no other god but you as is clear from everything which has come to our ears
 and what other nation in the earth like your people israel did a god go out to take for himself to be his people and to make a name for himself and to do great and strange things for them driving out a nation and its gods from before his people
 but you took and made strong for yourself your people israel to be your people for ever and you lord became their god
 and now o lord god may the word which you have said about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever and may you do as you have said 
 and let your name be made great for ever and let men say the lord of armies is god over israel and let the family of david your servant be made strong before you 
 for you o lord of armies the god of israel have clearly said to your servant i will make you the head of a family of kings and so it has come into your servants heart to make this prayer to you
 and now o lord god you are god and your words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good thing
 so may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant so that it may go on for ever before you  for you o lord god have said it  and may your blessing be on your servants family line for ever 
 and it came about after this that david made an attack on the philistines and overcame them and david took the authority of the mother town from the hands of the philistines
 and he overcame the moabites and he had them measured with a line when they were stretched out on the earth marking out two lines for death and one full line for life so the moabites became servants to david and gave him offerings
 and david overcame hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah when he went to make his power seen by the river
 and david took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david had the leg muscles of the horses cut only keeping enough of them for a hundred war carriages
 and when the aramaeans of damascus came to the help of hadadezer king of zobah david put to the sword twenty two thousand of the aramaeans
 and david put armed forces in aram of damascus and the aramaeans became servants to david and gave him offerings and the lord made david overcome wherever he went
 and david took their gold body covers from the servants of hadadezer and took them to jerusalem
 and from tebah and berothai towns of hadadezer king david took a great store of brass
 and when tou king of hamath had news that david had overcome all the army of hadadezer
 he sent his son hadoram to david with words of peace and blessing because he had overcome hadadezer in the fight for hadadezer had wars with tou and hadoram took with him vessels of silver and gold and brass
 these king david made holy to the lord together with the silver and gold which he had taken from the nations he had overcome  
 the nations of edom and moab and the children of ammon and the philistines and the amalekites and the goods he had taken from hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah
 and david got great honour for himself when he came back by the destruction of edom in the valley of salt to the number of eighteen thousand men
 and he put armed forces in edom all through edom he had armed forces stationed and all the edomites became servants to david and the lord made david overcome wherever he went
 and david was king over all israel judging and giving right decisions for all his people
 and joab the son of zeruiah was chief of the army and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was keeper of the records
 and zadok and abiathar the son of ahimelech the son of ahitub were priests and seraiah was the scribe
 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and davids sons were priests
 and david said is there still anyone of sauls family living so that i may be a friend to him because of jonathan
 now there was of sauls people a servant named ziba and they sent him to david and the king said to him are you ziba and he said i am
 and the king said is there anyone of sauls family still living to whom i may be a friend in gods name and ziba said there is a son of jonathan whose feet are damaged
 and the king said to him where is he and ziba said to the king he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lo debar
 then king david sent and had him taken from lo debar from the house of machir the son of ammiel
 and mephibosheth the son of jonathan came to david and falling down on his face gave him honour and david said mephibosheth and answering he said your servant is here
 and david said to him have no fear for truly i will be good to you because of your father jonathan and i will give back to you all the land which was sauls and you will have a place at my table at all times
 and he went down on his face before the king and said what is your servant for you to take note of a dead dog such as i am
 then the king sent for ziba sauls servant and said to him all the property of saul and of his family i have given to your masters son
 and you and your sons and your servants are to take care of the land for him and get in the fruit of it so that your masters son may have food but mephibosheth your masters son will have a place at my table at all times now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants
 then ziba said to the king every order which you have given to your servant will be done as for mephibosheth he had a place at davids table like one of the kings sons
 and mephibosheth had a young son named mica and all the people living in the house of ziba were servants to mephibosheth
 so mephibosheth went on living in jerusalem for he took all his meals at the kings table and he had not the use of his feet
 the words of amos who was among the herdsmen of tekoa what he saw about israel in the days of uzziah king of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel two years before the earth shock
 and he said the lord will give a lions cry from zion his voice will be sounding from jerusalem and the fields of the keepers of sheep will become dry and the top of carmel will be wasted away
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of damascus and for four i will not let its fate be changed because they have been crushing gilead with iron grain crushing instruments
 and i will send a fire into the house of hazael burning up the great houses of ben hadad
 and i will have the locks of the door of damascus broken and him who is seated in power cut off from the valley of aven and him in whose hand is the rod from the house of eden and the people of aram will go away as prisoners into kir says the lord
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of gaza and for four i will not let its fate be changed because they took all the people away prisoners to give them up to edom
 and i will send a fire on the wall of gaza burning up its great houses
 him who is seated in power i will have cut off from ashdod and him in whose hand is the rod from ashkelon and my hand will be turned against ekron and the rest of the philistines will come to destruction says the lord god
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of tyre and for four i will not let its fate be changed because they gave up all the people prisoners to edom without giving a thought to the brothers agreement between them
 and i will send a fire on the wall of tyre burning up its great houses
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of edom and for four i will not let its fate be changed because his sword was turned against his brother without pity and his wrath was burning at all times and he was angry for ever
 and i will send a fire on teman burning up the great houses of bozrah
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of the children of ammon and for four i will not let its fate be changed because in gilead they had women with child cut open so that they might make wider the limits of their land
 and i will make a fire in the wall of rabbah burning up its great houses with loud cries in the days of war with a storm in the day of the great wind
 and their king will be made prisoner he and his captains together says the lord
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of moab and for four i will not let its fate be changed because he had the bones of the king of edom burned to dust
 and i will send a fire on moab burning up the great houses of kerioth and death will come on moab with noise and outcries and the sound of the horn
 and i will have the judge cut off from among them and all their captains i will put to death with him says the lord
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of judah and for four i will not let its fate be changed because they have given up the law of the lord and have not kept his rules and their false ways in which their fathers went have made them go out of the right way
 and i will send a fire on judah burning up the great houses of jerusalem
 these are the words of the lord for three crimes of israel and for four i will not let its fate be changed because they have given the upright man for silver and the poor for the price of two shoes
 crushing the head of the poor and turning the steps of the gentle out of the way and a man and his father go in to the same young woman putting shame on my holy name
 by every altar they are stretched on clothing taken from those who are in their debt drinking in the house of their god the wine of those who have made payment for wrongdoing
 though i sent destruction on the amorite before them who was tall as the cedar and strong as the oak tree cutting off his fruit from on high and his roots from under the earth
 and i took you up out of the land of egypt guiding you for forty years in the waste land so that you might take for your heritage the land of the amorite
 and some of your sons i made prophets and some of your young men i made separate for myself is it not even so o children of israel says the lord
 but to those who were separate you gave wine for drink and to the prophets you said be prophets no longer
 see i am crushing you down as one is crushed under a cart full of grain
 and flight will be impossible for the quick footed and the force of the strong will become feeble and the man of war will not get away safely
 and the bowman will not keep his place he who is quick footed will not get away safely and the horseman will not keep his life
 and he who is without fear among the fighting men will go in flight without his clothing in that day says the lord
 give ear to this word which the lord has said against you o children of israel against all the family which i took up out of the land of egypt saying
 you only of all the families of the earth have i taken care of for this reason i will send punishment on you for all your sins
 is it possible for two to go walking together if not by agreement
 will a lion give his loud cry in the woodland when no food is there will the voice of the young lion be sounding from his hole if he has taken nothing
 is it possible for a bird to be taken in a net on the earth where no net has been put for him will the net come up from the earth if it has taken nothing at all
 if the horn is sounded in the town will the people not be full of fear will evil come on a town if the lord has not done it
 certainly the lord will do nothing without making clear his secret to his servants the prophets
 the cry of the lion is sounding who will not have fear the lord god has said the word is it possible for the prophet to keep quiet
 give out the news in the great houses of assyria and in the land of egypt and say come together on the mountains of samaria and see what great outcries are there and what cruel acts are done in it
 for they have no knowledge of how to do what is right says the lord who are storing up violent acts and destruction in their great houses
 for this reason says the lord an attacker will come shutting in the land on every side and your strength will come down and your great houses will be made waste
 these are the words of the lord as the keeper of sheep takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs or part of an ear so will the children of israel be made safe who are resting in samaria on seats of honour or on the silk cushions of a bed
 give ear now and give witness against the family of jacob says the lord god the god of armies
 for in the day when i give israel punishment for his sins i will send punishment on the altars of beth el and the horns of the altar will be cut off and come down to the earth
 and i will send destruction on the winter house with the summer house the ivory houses will be falling down and the great houses will come to an end says the lord
 give ear to this word you cows of bashan who are in the hill of samaria by whom the poor are kept down and those in need are crushed who say to their lords get out the wine and give us drink
 the lord god has taken an oath by his holy name that the days are coming when they will take you away with hooks and the rest of you with fish hooks
 and you will go out through the broken places every one going straight before her and you will be sent into harmon says the lord
 come to beth el and do evil to gilgal increasing the number of your sins come with your offerings every morning and your tenths every three days
 let that which is leavened be burned as a praise offering let the news of your free offerings be given out publicly for this is pleasing to you o children of israel says the lord
 but in all your towns i have kept food from your teeth and in all your places there has been need of bread and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 and i have kept back the rain from you when it was still three months before the grain cutting i sent rain on one town and kept it back from another one part was rained on and the part where there was no rain became a waste
 so two or three towns went wandering to one town looking for water and did not get enough and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 i have sent destruction on your fields by burning and disease the increase of your gardens and your vine gardens your fig trees and your olive trees has been food for worms and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 i have sent disease among you as it was in egypt i have put your young men to the sword and have taken away your horses i have made the evil smell from your tents come up to your noses and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 and i have sent destruction among you as when god sent destruction on sodom and gomorrah and you were like a burning stick pulled out of the fire and still you have not come back to me says the lord
 so this is what i will do to you o israel and because i will do this to you be ready for a meeting with your god o israel
 for see he who gave form to the mountains and made the wind giving knowledge of his purpose to man who makes the morning dark and is walking on the high places of the earth the lord the god of armies is his name
 give ear to this word my song of sorrow over you o children of israel
 the virgin of israel has been made low never again to be lifted up she is stretched out by herself on her land there is no one to put her on her feet again
 for these are the words of the lord god the town which was able to send out a thousand will have only a hundred and that which sent out a hundred will have only ten in israel
 for these are the words of the lord to the children of israel let your hearts be turned to me so that you may have life
 do not be looking for help to beth el and do not go to gilgal or make your way to beer sheba for gilgal will certainly be taken prisoner and beth el will come to nothing
 go to the lord for help so that you may have life for fear that he may come like fire bursting out in the family of joseph causing destruction and there will be no one to put it out in beth el
 you who make the work of judging a bitter thing crushing down righteousness to the earth
 go for help to him who makes orion and the pleiades by whom the deep dark is turned into morning who makes the day black with night whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea sending them out over the face of the earth the lord is his name
 who sends sudden destruction on the strong so that destruction comes on the walled town
 they have hate for him who makes protest against evil in the public place and he whose words are upright is disgusting to them
 so because the poor man is crushed under your feet and you take taxes from him of grain you have made for yourselves houses of cut stone but you will not take your rest in them the fair vine gardens planted by your hands will not give you wine
 for i have seen how your evil doing is increased and how strong are your sins you troublers of the upright who take rewards and do wrong to the cause of the poor in the public place
 so the wise will say nothing in that time for it is an evil time
 go after good and not evil so that life may be yours and so the lord the god of armies will be with you as you say
 be haters of evil and lovers of good and let right be done in the public place it may be that the lord the god of armies will have mercy on the rest of joseph
 so these are the words of the lord the god of armies the lord there will be weeping in all the open spaces and in all the streets they will say sorrow  sorrow  and they will get in the farmer to the weeping and the makers of sad songs to give cries of grief
 in all the vine gardens there will be cries of grief for i will go through among you says the lord
 sorrow to you who are looking for the day of the lord  what is the day of the lord to you it is dark and not light
 as if a man running away from a lion came face to face with a bear or went into the house and put his hand on the wall and got a bite from a snake
 will not the day of the lord be dark and not light even very dark with no light shining in it
 your feasts are disgusting to me i will have nothing to do with them i will take no delight in your holy meetings
 even if you give me your burned offerings and your meal offerings i will not take pleasure in them i will have nothing to do with the peace offerings of your fat beasts
 take away from me the noise of your songs my ears are shut to the melody of your instruments
 but let the right go rolling on like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
 did you come to me with offerings of beasts and meal offerings in the waste land for forty years o israel
 truly you will take up saccuth your king and kaiwan your images the star of your god which you made for yourselves
 and i will send you away as prisoners farther than damascus says the lord whose name is the god of armies
 sorrow to those who are resting in comfort in zion and to those who have no fear of danger in the mountain of samaria the noted men of the chief of the nations to whom the people of israel come 
 go on to calneh and see and from there go to hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines are you better than these kingdoms or is your land wider than theirs
 you who put far away the evil day causing the rule of the violent to come near
 who are resting on beds of ivory stretched out on soft seats feasting on lambs from the flock and young oxen from the cattle house
 making foolish songs to the sound of corded instruments and designing for themselves instruments of music like david
 drinking wine in basins rubbing themselves with the best oils but they have no grief for the destruction of joseph
 so now they will go away prisoners with the first of those who are made prisoners and the loud cry of those who were stretched out will come to an end
 the lord god has taken an oath by himself says the lord the god of armies the pride of jacob is disgusting to me and i have hate for his great houses so i will give up the town with everything in it
 then it will come about that if there are still ten men in a house death will overtake them
 and when a mans relation even the one who is responsible for burning his body lifting him up to take his bones out of the house says to him who is in the inmost part of the house is there still anyone with you and he says no then he will say keep quiet for the name of the lord may not be named
 for see at the order of the lord the great house will be full of cracks and the little house will be broken
 is it possible for horses to go running on the rock may the sea be ploughed with oxen for the right to be turned by you into poison and the fruit of righteousness into a bitter plant
 you whose joy is in a thing of no value who say have we not taken for ourselves horns by the strength which is ours
 for see i will send against you a nation o israel says the lord the god of armies ruling you cruelly from the way into hamath as far as the stream of the arabah
 this is what the lord god let me see and i saw that when the growth of the late grass was starting he made locusts it was the late growth after the kings cutting was done
 and it came about that after they had taken all the grass of the land i said o lord god have mercy how will jacob be able to keep his place for he is small
 the lord changing his purpose about this said it will not be
 this is what the lord let me see and i saw that the lord god sent for a great fire to be the instrument of his punishment and after burning up the great deep it was about to put an end to the lords heritage
 then said i o lord god let there be an end how will jacob be able to keep his place for he is small
 the lord changing his purpose about this said and this will not be
 this is what he let me see and i saw the lord stationed by a wall made straight by a weighted line and he had a weighted line in his hand
 and the lord said to me amos what do you see and i said a weighted line then the lord said see i will let down a weighted line among my people israel never again will my eyes be shut to their sin
 and the high places of isaac will be unpeopled and the holy places of israel will be made waste and i will come up against the family of jeroboam with the sword
 then amaziah the priest of beth el sent to jeroboam king of israel saying amos has made designs against you among the people of israel the land is troubled by his words
 for amos has said jeroboam will be put to the sword and israel will certainly be taken away as a prisoner out of his land
 and amaziah said to amos o seer go in flight into the land of judah and there get your living by working as a prophet
 but be a prophet no longer at beth el for it is the holy place of the king and the kings house
 then amos in answer said to amaziah i am no prophet or one of the sons of the prophets i am a herdman and one who takes care of sycamore trees
 and the lord took me from the flock and the lord said to me go be a prophet to my people israel
 now then give ear to the word of the lord you say be no prophet to israel and say not a word against the people of isaac
 so this is what the lord has said your wife will be a loose woman in the town and your sons and your daughters will be put to the sword and your land will be cut up into parts by a line and you yourself will come to your end in an unclean land and israel will certainly be taken away a prisoner out of his land
 this is what the lord god let me see and i saw a basket of summer fruit
 and he said amos what do you see and i said a basket of summer fruit then the lord said to me the end has come to my people israel never again will my eyes be shut to their sin
 and the songs of the kings house will be cries of pain in that day says the lord god great will be the number of the dead bodies and everywhere they will put them out without a word
 give ear to this you who are crushing the poor and whose purpose is to put an end to those who are in need in the land
 saying when will the new moon be gone so that we may do trade in grain and the sabbath so that we may put out in the market the produce of our fields making the measure small and the price great and trading falsely with scales of deceit
 getting the poor for silver and him who is in need for the price of two shoes and taking a price for the waste parts of the grain
 the lord has taken an oath by the pride of jacob truly i will ever keep in mind all their works
 will not the land be shaking with fear because of this and everyone in it have sorrow and all of it will be overflowing like the river and it will be troubled and go down again like the river of egypt
 and it will come about in that day says the lord god that i will make the sun go down in the middle of the day and i will make the earth dark in daylight
 your feasts will be turned into sorrow and all your melody into songs of grief everyone will be clothed with haircloth and the hair of every head will be cut i will make the weeping like that for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day
 see the days are coming says the lord god when i will send times of great need on the land not need of food or desire for water but for hearing the words of the lord
 and they will go wandering from sea to sea and from the north even to the east running here and there in search of the word of the lord and they will not get it
 in that day the fair virgins and the young men will be feeble from need of water
 those who make their oaths by the sin of samaria and say by the life of your god o dan and by the living way of beer sheba even they will go down never again to be lifted up
 i saw the lord stationed by the side of the altar giving blows to the tops of the pillars so that the doorsteps were shaking and he said i will let all of them be broken with earth shocks i will put the last of them to the sword if any one of them goes in flight he will not get away not one of them will be safe
 even if they go deep into the underworld my hand will take them up from there if they go up to heaven i will get them down
 though they take cover on the top of carmel i will go in search of them and get them out though they keep themselves from my eyes in the bed of the sea i will give orders to the great snake there and he will give them a bite
 and though they are taken away as prisoners by their attackers even there will i give orders to the sword to put them to death my eyes will be fixed on them for evil and not for good
 for the lord the god of armies is he at whose touch the land is turned to water and everyone in it will be given up to sorrow all of it will be overflowing like the river and will go down again like the river of egypt
 it is he who makes his rooms in the heaven basing his arch on the earth whose voice goes out to the waters of the sea and sends them flowing over the face of the earth the lord is his name
 are you not as the children of the ethiopians to me o children of israel says the lord have i not taken israel up out of the land of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the aramaeans from kir
 see the eyes of the lord are on the evil kingdom and i will put an end to it in all the earth but i will not send complete destruction on jacob says the lord
 for see i will give orders and i will have israel moved about among all the nations as grain is moved about by the shaking of the tray but not the smallest seed will be dropped on the earth
 all those sinners among my people will be put to the sword who say evil will not overtake us or come face to face with us
 in that day i will put up the tent of david which has come down and make good its broken places and i will put up again his damaged walls building it up as in the past
 so that the rest of edom may be their heritage and all the nations who have been named by my name says the lord who is doing this
 see the days will come says the lord when the ploughman will overtake him who is cutting the grain and the crusher of the grapes him who is planting seed and sweet wine will be dropping from the mountains and the hills will be turned into streams of wine
 and i will let the fate of my people israel be changed and they will be building up again the waste towns and living in them they will again be planting vine gardens and taking the wine for their drink and they will make gardens and get the fruit of them
 and i will have them planted in their land and never again will they be uprooted from their land which i have given them says the lord your god
 in the third year of the rule of jehoiakim king of judah nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came to jerusalem shutting it in with his forces
 and the lord gave into his hands jehoiakim king of judah with some of the vessels of the house of god and he took them away into the land of shinar to the house of his god and he put the vessels into the store house of his god
 and the king gave orders to ashpenaz the captain of his unsexed servants to take in some of the children of israel certain of the kings family and those of high birth
 young men who were strong and healthy good looking and trained in all wisdom having a good education and much knowledge and able to take positions in the kings house and to have them trained in the writing and language of the chaldaeans
 and a regular amount of food and wine every day from the kings table was ordered for them by the king and they were to be cared for for three years so that at the end of that time they might take their places before the king
 and among these there were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah
 and the captain of the unsexed servants gave them names to daniel he gave the name of belteshazzar to hananiah the name of shadrach to mishael the name of meshach and to azariah the name of abed nego
 and daniel had come to the decision that he would not make himself unclean with the kings food or wine so he made a request to the captain of the unsexed servants that he might not make himself unclean
 and god put into the heart of the captain of the unsexed servants kind feelings and pity for daniel
 and the captain of the unsexed servants said to daniel i am in fear of my lord the king who has given orders about your food and your drink what if he sees you looking less happy than the other young men of your generation then you would have put my head in danger from the king
 then daniel said to the keeper in whose care the captain of the unsexed servants had put daniel hananiah mishael and azariah
 put your servants to the test for ten days let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink
 then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the kings table and having seen them do to your servants as it seems right to you
 so he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days
 and at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the kings table
 so the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink and gave them grain
 now as for these four young men god gave them knowledge and made them expert in all book learning and wisdom and daniel was wise in all visions and dreams
 now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to nebuchadnezzar
 and the king had talk with them and among them all there was no one like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah so they were given places before the king
 and in any business needing wisdom and good sense about which the king put questions to them he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom
 and daniel went on till the first year of king cyrus
 in the third year of cyrus king of persia a secret was unfolded to daniel whose name was belteshazzar and the thing was true even a hard work and he had knowledge of it and the vision was clear to him
 in those days i daniel gave myself up to grief for three full weeks
 i had no pleasing food no meat or wine came into my mouth and i put no oil on my body till three full weeks were ended
 and on the twenty fourth day of the first month i was by the side of the great river
 and lifting up my eyes i saw the form of a man clothed in a linen robe and round him there was a band of gold of the best gold
 and his body was like the beryl and his face had the look of a thunder flame and his eyes were like burning lights and his arms and feet like the colour of polished brass and the sound of his voice was like the sound of an army
 and i daniel was the only one who saw the vision for the men who were with me did not see it but a great shaking came on them and they went in flight to take cover
 so i was by myself and i saw this great vision and all my strength went from me and the colour went from my face
 but the sound of his words came to my ears and on hearing his voice i went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth
 then a hand gave me a touch awaking me and putting me on my knees and my hands
 and he said to me o daniel you man dearly loved take in the sense of the words i say to you and get up on to your feet for to you i am now sent and when he had said this to me i got on to my feet shaking with fear
 then he said to me have no fear daniel for from the first day when you gave your heart to getting wisdom and making yourself poor in spirit before your god your words have come to his ears and i have come because of your words
 but the angel of the kingdom of persia put himself against me for twenty one days but michael one of the chief angels came to my help and when i came he was still there with the angel of the kings of persia
 now i have come to give you knowledge of the fate of your people in the later days for there is still a vision for the days
 and after he had said these words to me i kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything
 then one whose form was like the sons of men put his finger on my lips and opening my mouth i said to him who was before me o my lord because of the vision my pains have come on me and i have no more strength
 for how may this servant of my lord have talk with my lord for as for me straight away my strength went from me and there was no breath in my body
 then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength
 and he said to me o man greatly loved have no fear peace be with you be strong and let your heart be lifted up and at his words i became strong and said let my lord say on for you have given me strength
 then he said it is clear to you why i have come to you and now i will give you an account of what is recorded in the true writings
 but i am going back to make war with the angel of persia and when i am gone the angel of greece will come and there is no one on my side against these but michael your angel
 and as for me in the first year of darius the mede i was on his side to make his position safe and make him strong
 and now i will make clear to you what is true there are still three kings to come in persia and the fourth will have much greater wealth than all of them and when he has become strong through his wealth he will put his forces in motion against all the kingdoms of greece
 and a strong king will come to power ruling with great authority and doing whatever is his pleasure
 and when he has become strong his kingdom will be broken and parted to the four winds of heaven but not to his offspring for it will be uprooted and his kingdom will be for the others and not for these but not with the same authority as his
 and the king of the south will be strong but one of his captains will be stronger than he and will be ruler and his rule will be a great rule
 and at the end of years they will be joined together and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she will not keep the strength of her arm and his offspring will not keep their place but she will be uprooted with those who were the cause of her coming and her son and he who took her in those times
 but out of a branch from her roots one will come up to take his place who will come against the army forcing his way into the strong place of the king of the north and he will take them in hand and overcome them
 and their gods and their metal images and their fair vessels of silver and gold he will take away into the south and for some years he will keep away from the king of the north
 and he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south but he will go back to his land
 and his son will make war and will get together an army of great forces and he will make an attack on him overflowing and going past and he will again take the war even to his strong place
 and the king of the south will be moved with wrath and will come out and make war on him on this same king of the north and he will get together a great army but the army will be given into his hand
 and the army will be taken away and his heart will be uplifted he will be the cause of the downfall of tens of thousands but he will not be strong
 and again the king of the north will get together an army greater than the first and he will make an attack on him at the end of years with a great army and much wealth
 in those times a number will take up arms against the king of the south and the children of the violent among your people will be lifting themselves up to make the vision come true but it will be their downfall
 so the king of the north will come and put up earthworks and take a well armed town and the forces of the king of the south will make an attempt to keep their position even the best of his army but they will not have strength to do so
 and he who comes against him will do his pleasure and no one will be able to keep his place before him he will take up his position in the beautiful land and in his hand there will be destruction
 and it will be his purpose to come with the strength of all his kingdom but in place of this he will make an agreement with him and he will give him the daughter of women to send destruction on it but this will not take place or come about
 after this his face will be turned to the islands and he will take a number of them but a chief by his destruction will put an end to the shame offered by him and more than this he will make his shame come back on him
 then his face will be turned to the strong places of his land but his way will be stopped causing his downfall and he will not be seen again
 then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together but after a short time destruction will overtake him but not in wrath or in the fight
 and his place will be taken by a low person to whom the honour of the kingdom had not been given but he will come in time of peace and will get the kingdom by fair words
 and his forces will be completely taken away from before him and broken and even the ruler of the agreement will have the same fate
 and from the time when they make an agreement with him he will be working falsely for he will take up arms suddenly with a small force
 against fertile places and will make waste a part of the country and he will do what his fathers have not done or his fathers fathers he will make distribution among them of goods taken in war and by force and of property he will even make designs against the strong places for a time
 and he will put in motion his power and his strength against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south will go to war with a very great and strong army but he will be forced to give way because of their designs against him
 and his fears will overcome him and be the cause of his downfall and his army will come to complete destruction and a great number will be put to the sword
 and as for these two kings their hearts will be fixed on doing evil and they will say false words at one table but it will come to nothing for the end will be at the time fixed
 and he will go back to his land with great wealth and his heart will be against the holy agreement and he will do his pleasure and go back to his land
 at the time fixed he will come back and come into the south but in the later time it will not be as it was before
 for those who go out from the west will come against him and he will be in fear and will go back full of wrath against the holy agreement and he will do his pleasure and he will go back and be united with those who have given up the holy agreement
 and armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place even the strong place and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear
 and those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words but the people who have knowledge of their god will be strong and do well
 and those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time
 now at the time of their downfall they will have a little help but numbers will be joined to them in the town and in their separate heritages
 and some of those who are wise will have wisdom in testing themselves and making themselves clean till the time of the end for it is still for the fixed time
 and the king will do his pleasure he will put himself on high lifting himself over every god and saying things to be wondered at against the god of gods and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete for what has been purposed will be done
 he will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women he will have no respect for any god for he will put himself on high over all
 but in place of this he will give honour to the god of armed places and to a god of whom his fathers had no knowledge he will give honour with gold and silver and jewels and things to be desired
 and he will make use of the people of a strange god to keep his strongest places to those whom he takes note of he will give high honour and he will make them rulers over the mass of the people and will make division of the land for a price
 and at the time of the end the king of the south will make an attack on him and the king of the north will come against him like a storm wind with war carriages and horsemen and numbers of ships and he will go through many lands like overflowing waters
 and he will come into the beautiful land and tens of thousands will be overcome but these will be kept from falling into his hands edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon
 and his hand will be stretched out on the countries and the land of the south will not be safe from him
 but he will have power over the stores of gold and silver and over all the valued things of the south and the libyans and the ethiopians will be at his steps
 but he will be troubled by news from the east and from the north and he will go out in great wrath to send destruction on and put an end to great numbers
 he will put the tents of his great house between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain but he will come to his end with no helper
 and at that time michael will take up his place the great angel who is the supporter of the children of your people and there will be a time of trouble such as there never was from the time there was a nation even till that same time and at that time your people will be kept safe everyone who is recorded in the book
 and a number of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will come out of their sleep some to eternal life and some to eternal shame
 and those who are wise will be shining like the light of the outstretched sky and those by whom numbers have been turned to righteousness will be like the stars for ever and ever
 but as for you o daniel let the words be kept secret and the book rolled up and kept shut till the time of the end numbers will be going out of the way and troubles will be increased
 then i daniel looking saw two others one at the edge of the river on this side and one at the edge of the river on that side
 and i said to the man clothed in linen who was over the waters of the river how long will it be to the end of these wonders
 then in my hearing the man clothed in linen who was over the river lifting up his right hand and his left hand to heaven took an oath by him who is living for ever that it would be a time times and a half and when the power of the crusher of the holy people comes to an end all these things will be ended
 and the words came to my ears but the sense of them was not clear to me then i said o my lord what is the sense of these things
 and he said go on your way daniel for the words are secret and shut up till the time of the end
 till a number are tested and make themselves clean and the evil doers will do evil for not one of the evil doers will have knowledge but all will be made clear to those who are wise
 and from the time when the regular burned offering is taken away and an unclean thing causing fear is put up there will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days
 a blessing will be on the man who goes on waiting and comes to the thousand three hundred and thirty five days
 but you go on your way and take your rest for you will be in your place at the end of the days
 in the second year of the rule of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar had dreams and his spirit was troubled and his sleep went from him
 then the king gave orders that the wonder workers and the users of secret arts and those who made use of evil powers and the chaldaeans were to be sent for to make clear to the king his dreams so they came and took their places before the king
 and the king said to them i have had a dream and my spirit is troubled by the desire to have the dream made clear to me
 then the chaldaeans said to the king in the aramaean language o king have life for ever give your servants an account of your dream and we will make clear to you the sense of it
 the king made answer and said to the chaldaeans this is my decision if you do not make clear to me the dream and the sense of it you will be cut in bits and your houses made waste
 but if you make clear the dream and the sense of it you will have from me offerings and rewards and great honour so make clear to me the dream and the sense of it
 a second time they said in answer let the king give his servants an account of his dream and we will make clear the sense
 the king made answer and said i am certain that you are attempting to get more time because you see that my decision is fixed
 that if you do not make my dream clear to me there is only one fate for you for you have made ready false and evil words to say before me till the times are changed so give me an account of the dream and i will be certain that you are able to make the sense of it clear
 then the chaldaeans said to the king in answer there is not a man on earth able to make clear the kings business for no king however great his power has ever made such a request to any wonder worker or user of secret arts or chaldaean
 the kings request is a very hard one and there is no other who is able to make it clear to the king but the gods whose living place is not with flesh
 because of this the king was angry and full of wrath and gave orders for the destruction of all the wise men of babylon
 so the order went out that the wise men were to be put to death and they were looking for daniel and his friends to put them to death
 then daniel gave an answer with wisdom and good sense to arioch the captain of the kings armed men who had gone out to put to death the wise men of babylon
 he made answer and said to arioch o captain of the king why is the kings order so cruel then arioch gave daniel an account of the business
 and daniel went in and made a request to the king to give him time and he would make clear the sense of his dream to the king
 and daniel went to his house and gave his friends hananiah mishael and azariah the news
 so that they might make a request for the mercy of the god of heaven in the question of this secret so that daniel and his friends might not come to destruction with the rest of the wise men of babylon
 then the secret was made clear to daniel in a vision of the night and daniel gave blessing to the god of heaven
 and daniel said in answer may the name of god be praised for ever and ever for wisdom and strength are his
 by him times and years are changed by him kings are taken away and kings are lifted up he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those whose minds are awake
 he is the unveiler of deep and secret things he has knowledge of what is in the dark and the light has its living place with him
 i give you praise and worship o god of my fathers who have given me wisdom and strength and have now made clear to me what we were requesting from you for you have given us knowledge of the kings business
 for this reason daniel went to arioch to whom the king had given orders for the destruction of the wise men of babylon and said to him do not put to death the wise men of babylon take me in before the king and i will make clear to him the sense of the dream
 then arioch quickly took daniel in before the king and said to him here is a man from among the prisoners of judah who will make clear to the king the sense of the dream
 the king made answer and said to daniel whose name was belteshazzar are you able to make clear to me the dream which i saw and its sense
 then daniel said in answer to the king no wise men or users of secret arts or wonder workers or readers of signs are able to make clear to the king the secret he is searching for
 but there is a god in heaven the unveiler of secrets and he has given to king nebuchadnezzar knowledge of what will take place in the last days your dreams and the visions of your head on your bed are these
 as for you o king the thoughts which came to you on your bed were of what will come about after this and the unveiler of secrets has made clear to you what is to come
 as for me this secret is not made clear to me because of any wisdom which i have more than any living man but in order that the sense of the dream may be made clear to the king and that you may have knowledge of the thoughts of your heart
 you o king were looking and a great image was there this image which was very great and whose glory was very bright was placed before you its form sent fear into the heart
 as for this image its head was made of the best gold its breast and its arms were of silver its middle and its sides were of brass
 its legs of iron its feet were in part of iron and in part of potters earth
 while you were looking at it a stone was cut out but not by hands and it gave the image a blow on its feet which were of iron and earth and they were broken in bits
 then the iron and the earth the brass and the silver and the gold were smashed together and became like the dust on the floors where grain is crushed in summer and the wind took them away so that no sign of them was to be seen and the stone which gave the image a blow became a great mountain covering all the earth
 this is the dream and we will make clear to the king the sense of it
 you o king king of kings to whom the god of heaven has given the kingdom the power and the strength and the glory
 wherever the children of men are living into whose hands he has given the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and has made you ruler over them all you are the head of gold
 and after you another kingdom lower than you will come to power and a third kingdom of brass ruling over all the earth
 and the fourth kingdom will be strong as iron because as all things are broken and overcome by iron so it will have the power of crushing and smashing down all the earth
 and as you saw the feet and toes part of potters work and part of iron there will be a division in the kingdom but there will be some of the strength of iron in it because you saw the iron mixed with the potters earth
 and as the toes of the feet were in part of iron and in part of earth so part of the kingdom will be strong and part of it will readily be broken
 and as you saw the iron mixed with earth they will give their daughters to one another as wives but they will not be united one with another even as iron is not mixed with earth
 and in the days of those kings the god of heaven will put up a kingdom which will never come to destruction and its power will never be given into the hands of another people and all these kingdoms will be broken and overcome by it but it will keep its place for ever
 because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that by it the iron and the brass and the earth and the silver and the gold were broken to bits a great god has given the king knowledge of what is to take place in the future the dream is fixed and its sense is certain
 then king nebuchadnezzar falling down on his face gave worship to daniel and gave orders for an offering and spices to be given to him
 and the king made answer to daniel and said truly your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and an unveiler of secrets for you have been able to make this secret clear
 then the king made daniel great and gave him offerings in great number and made him ruler over all the land of babylon and chief over all the wise men of babylon
 and at daniels request the king gave shadrach meshach and abed nego authority over the business of the land of babylon but daniel was kept near the kings person
 nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold sixty cubits high and six cubits wide he put it up in the valley of dura in the land of babylon
 and nebuchadnezzar the king sent to get together all the captains the chiefs the rulers the wise men the keepers of public money the judges the overseers and all the rulers of the divisions of the country to come to see the unveiling of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had put up
 then the captains the chiefs the rulers the wise men the keepers of public money the judges the overseers and all the rulers of the divisions of the country came together to see the unveiling of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had put up and they took their places before the image which nebuchadnezzar had put up
 then one of the kings criers said in a loud voice to you the order is given o peoples nations and languages
 that when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments comes to your ears you are to go down on your faces in worship before the image of gold which nebuchadnezzar the king has put up
 and anyone not falling down and worshipping will that same hour be put into a burning and flaming fire
 so at that time all the people when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery and all sorts of instruments came to their ears went down on their faces in worship before the image of gold which nebuchadnezzar the king had put up
 at that time certain chaldaeans came near and made a statement against the jews
 they made answer and said to nebuchadnezzar the king o king have life for ever
 you o king have given an order that every man when the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments comes to his ears is to go down on his face in worship before the image of gold
 and anyone not falling down and worshipping is to be put into a burning and flaming fire
 there are certain jews whom you have put over the business of the land of babylon shadrach meshach and abed nego these men have not given attention to you o king they are not servants of your gods or worshippers of the gold image which you have put up
 then nebuchadnezzar in his wrath and passion gave orders for shadrach meshach and abed nego to be sent for then they made these men come in before the king
 nebuchadnezzar made answer and said to them is it true o shadrach meshach and abed nego that you will not be servants of my god or give worship to the image of gold which i have put up
 now if you are ready on hearing the sound of the horn pipe harp trigon psaltery bagpipe and all sorts of instruments to go down on your faces in worship before the image which i have made it is well but if you will not give worship that same hour you will be put into a burning and flaming fire and what god is there who will be able to take you out of my hands
 shadrach meshach and abed nego answering nebuchadnezzar the king said there is no need for us to give you an answer to this question
 if our god whose servants we are is able to keep us safe from the burning and flaming fire and from your hands o king he will keep us safe
 but if not be certain o king that we will not be the servants of your gods or give worship to the image of gold which you have put up
 then nebuchadnezzar was full of wrath and the form of his face was changed against shadrach meshach and abed nego and he gave orders that the fire was to be heated up seven times more than it was generally heated
 and he gave orders to certain strong men in his army to put cords on shadrach meshach and abed nego and put them into the burning and flaming fire
 then these men had cords put round them as they were in their coats their trousers their hats and their clothing and were dropped into the burning and flaming fire
 and because the kings order was not to be put on one side and the heat of the fire was so great the men who took up shadrach meshach and abed nego were burned to death by the flame of the fire
 and these three men shadrach meshach and abed nego with the cords about them went down into the burning and flaming fire
 then king nebuchadnezzar full of fear and wonder got up quickly and said to his wise men did we not put three men in cords into the fire and they made answer and said to the king true o king
 he made answer and said look  i see four men loose walking in the middle of the fire and they are not damaged and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods
 then nebuchadnezzar came near the door of the burning and flaming fire he made answer and said shadrach meshach and abed nego you servants of the most high god come out and come here then shadrach meshach and abed nego came out of the fire
 and the captains the chiefs and the rulers and the kings wise men who had come together saw these men over whose bodies the fire had no power and not a hair of their heads was burned and their coats were not changed and there was no smell of fire about them
 nebuchadnezzar made answer and said praise be to the god of shadrach meshach and abed nego who has sent his angel and kept his servants safe who had faith in him and who put the kings word on one side and gave up their bodies to the fire so that they might not be servants or worshippers of any other god but their god
 and it is my decision that any people nation or language saying evil against the god of shadrach meshach and abed nego will be cut to bits and their houses made waste because there is no other god who is able to give salvation such as this
 then the king gave shadrach meshach and abed nego even greater authority in the land of babylon
 nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples nations and languages living in all the earth may your peace be increased
 it has seemed good to me to make clear the signs and wonders which the most high god has done with me
 how great are his signs  and how full of power are his wonders  his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and his rule goes on from generation to generation
 i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my place and all things were going well for me in my great house
 i saw a dream which was a cause of great fear to me i was troubled by the images of my mind on my bed and by the visions of my head
 and i gave orders for all the wise men of babylon to come in before me so that they might make clear to me the sense of my dream
 then the wonder workers the users of secret arts the chaldaeans and the readers of signs came in to me and i put the dream before them but they did not make clear the sense of it to me
 but at last daniel came in before me he whose name was belteshazzar after the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and i put the dream before him saying
 o belteshazzar master of the wonder workers because i am certain that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and you are troubled by no secret this is the dream which i saw make clear to me its sense
 on my bed i saw a vision there was a tree in the middle of the earth and it was very high
 and the tree became tall and strong stretching up to heaven and to be seen from the ends of the earth
 its leaves were fair and it had much fruit and in it was food enough for all the beasts of the field had shade under it and the birds of heaven were resting in its branches and it gave food to all living things
 in the visions of my head on my bed i saw a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven
 crying out with a loud voice and this is what he said let the tree be cut down and its branches broken off let its leaves be taken off and its fruit sent in every direction let the beasts get away from under it and the birds from its branches
 but keep its broken end and its roots still in the earth even with a band of iron and brass let him have the young grass of the field for food and let him be wet with the dew of heaven and let his part be with the beasts
 let his heart be changed from that of a man and the heart of a beast be given to him and let seven times go by him
 this order is fixed by the watchers and the decision is by the word of the holy ones so that the living may be certain that the most high is ruler over the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure lifting up over it the lowest of men
 this dream i king nebuchadnezzar saw and do you o belteshazzar make clear the sense of it for all the wise men of my kingdom are unable to make the sense of it clear to me but you are able for the spirit of the holy gods is in you
 then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was at a loss for a time his thoughts troubling him the king made answer and said belteshazzar do not be troubled by the dream or by the sense of it belteshazzar answering said my lord may the dream be about your haters and its sense about those who are against you
 the tree which you saw which became tall and strong stretching up to heaven and seen from the ends of the earth
 which had fair leaves and much fruit and had in it food for all under which the beasts of the field were living and in the branches of which the birds of heaven had their resting places
 it is you o king who have become great and strong for your power is increased and stretching up to heaven and your rule to the end of the earth
 and as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven saying let the tree be cut down and given to destruction
 this is the sense of it o king and it is the decision of the most high which has come on my lord the king
 that they will send you out from among men to be with the beasts of the field they will give you grass for your food like the oxen and you will be wet with the dew of heaven and seven times will go by you till you are certain that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure
 and as they gave orders to let the broken end and the roots of the tree be so your kingdom will be safe for you after it is clear to you that the heavens are ruling
 for this cause o king let my suggestion be pleasing to you and let your sins be covered by righteousness and your evil doing by mercy to the poor so that the time of your well being may be longer
 all this came to king nebuchadnezzar
 at the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in babylon
 the king made answer and said is this not great babylon which i have made for the living place of kings by the strength of my power and for the glory of my honour
 while the word was still in the kings mouth a voice came down from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to you it is said the kingdom has gone from you
 and they will send you out from among men to be with the beasts of the field they will give you grass for your food like the oxen and seven times will go by you till you are certain that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives it to any man at his pleasure
 that very hour the order about nebuchadnezzar was put into effect and he was sent out from among men and had grass for his food like the oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair became long as eagles feathers and his nails like those of birds
 and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifting up my eyes to heaven got back my reason and blessing the most high i gave praise and honour to him who is living for ever whose rule is an eternal rule and whose kingdom goes on from generation to generation
 and all the people of the earth are as nothing he does his pleasure in the army of heaven and among the people of the earth and no one is able to keep back his hand or say to him what are you doing
 at the same time my reason came back to me and for the glory of my kingdom my honour and my great name came back to me and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again and i was made safe in my kingdom and had more power than before
 now i nebuchadnezzar give worship and praise and honour to the king of heaven for all his works are true and his ways are right and those who go in pride he is able to make low
 belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his lords drinking wine before the thousand
 belshazzar while he was overcome with wine gave orders for them to put before him the gold and silver vessels which nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in jerusalem so that the king and his lords his wives and his other women might take their drink from them
 then they took in the gold and silver vessels which had been in the temple of the house of god at jerusalem and the king and his lords his wives and his other women took wine from them
 they took their wine and gave praise to the gods of gold and silver of brass and iron and wood and stone
 in that very hour the fingers of a mans hand were seen writing opposite the support for the light on the white wall of the kings house and the king saw the part of the hand which was writing
 then the colour went from the kings face and he was troubled by his thoughts strength went from his body and his knees were shaking
 the king crying out with a loud voice said that the users of secret arts the chaldaeans and the readers of signs were to be sent for the king made answer and said to the wise men of babylon whoever is able to make out this writing and make clear to me the sense of it will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold round his neck and will be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
 then all the kings wise men came in but they were not able to make out the writing or give the sense of it to the king
 then king belshazzar was greatly troubled and the colour went from his face and his lords were at a loss
 the queen because of the words of the king and his lords came into the house of the feast the queen made answer and said o king have life for ever do not be troubled by your thoughts or let the colour go from your face
 there is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of your father light and reason like the wisdom of the gods were seen in him and king nebuchadnezzar your father made him master of the wonder workers and the users of secret arts and the chaldaeans and the readers of signs
 because a most special spirit and knowledge and reason and the power of reading dreams and unfolding dark sayings and answering hard questions were seen to be in him even in daniel  named belteshazzar by the king  now let daniel be sent for and he will make clear the sense of the writing
 then they took daniel in before the king the king made answer and said to daniel so you are that daniel of the prisoners of judah whom my father took out of judah
 and i have had news of you that the spirit of the gods is in you and that light and reason and special wisdom have been seen in you
 and now the wise men the users of secret arts have been sent in before me for the purpose of reading this writing and making clear to me the sense of it but they are not able to make clear the sense of the thing
 and i have had news of you that you have the power of making things clear and of answering hard questions now if you are able to make out the writing and give me the sense of it you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain round your neck and be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
 then daniel made answer and said to the king keep your offerings for yourself and give your rewards to another but i after reading the writing to the king will give him the sense of it
 as for you o king the most high god gave to nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom and great power and glory and honour
 and because of the great power he gave him all peoples and nations and languages were shaking in fear before him some he put to death and others he kept living at his pleasure lifting up some and putting others down as it pleased him
 but when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became hard with pride he was put down from his place as king and they took his glory from him
 and he was sent out from among the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and he was living with the asses of the fields he had grass for his food like the oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he was certain that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of men and gives power over it to anyone at his pleasure
 and you his son o belshazzar have not kept your heart free from pride though you had knowledge of all this
 but you have been lifting yourself up against the lord of heaven and they have put the vessels of his house before you and you and your lords your wives and your women have taken wine in them and you have given praise to gods of silver and gold of brass and iron and wood and stone who are without the power of seeing or hearing and without knowledge and to the god in whose hand your breath is and whose are all your ways you have not given glory
 then the part of the hand was sent out from before him and this writing was recorded
 and this is the writing which was recorded mene tekel peres
 this is the sense of the words mene your kingdom has been numbered by god and ended
 tekel you have been put in the scales and seen to be under weight
 peres your kingdom has been cut up and given to the medes and persians
 then by the order of belshazzar they put a purple robe on daniel and a gold chain round his neck and a public statement was made that he was to be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom
 that very night belshazzar the king of the chaldaeans was put to death
 and darius the mede took the kingdom being then about sixty two years old
 darius was pleased to put over the kingdom a hundred and twenty captains who were to be all through the kingdom
 and over them were three chief rulers of whom daniel was one and the captains were to be responsible to the chief rulers so that the king might undergo no loss
 then this daniel did his work better than the chief rulers and the captains because there was a special spirit in him and it was the kings purpose to put him over all the kingdom
 then the chief rulers and the captains were looking for some cause for putting daniel in the wrong in connection with the kingdom but they were unable to put forward any wrongdoing or error against him because he was true and no error or wrong was to be seen in him
 then these men said we will only get a reason for attacking daniel in connection with the law of his god
 then these chief rulers and the captains came to the king and said to him o king darius have life for ever
 all the chief rulers of the kingdom the chiefs and the captains the wise men and the rulers have made a common decision to put in force a law having the kings authority and to give a strong order that whoever makes any request to any god or man but you o king for thirty days is to be put into the lions hole
 now o king put the order in force signing the writing so that it may not be changed like the law of the medes and persians which may not come to an end
 for this reason king darius put his name on the writing and the order
 and daniel on hearing that the writing had been signed went into his house  now he had windows in his room on the roof opening in the direction of jerusalem  and three times a day he went down on his knees in prayer and praise before his god as he had done before
 then these men were watching and saw daniel making prayers and requesting grace before his god
 then they came near before the king and said o king have you not put your name to an order that any man who makes a request to any god or man but you o king for thirty days is to be put into the lions hole the king made answer and said the thing is fixed by the law of the medes and persians which may not come to an end
 then they made answer and said before the king daniel one of the prisoners of judah has no respect for you o king or for the order signed by you but three times a day he makes his prayer to god
 when this thing came to the kings ears it was very evil to him and his heart was fixed on keeping daniel safe and till the going down of the sun he was doing everything in his power to get him free
 then these men said to the king be certain o king that by the law of the medes and persians no order or law which the king has put into force may be changed
 then the king gave the order and they took daniel and put him into the lions hole the king made answer and said to daniel your god whose servant you are at all times will keep you safe
 then they got a stone and put it over the mouth of the hole and it was stamped with the kings stamp and with the stamp of the lords so that the decision about daniel might not be changed
 then the king went to his great house and took no food that night and no  were placed before him and his sleep went from him
 then very early in the morning the king got up and went quickly to the lions hole
 and when he came near the hole where daniel was he gave a loud cry of grief the king made answer and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is your god whose servant you are at all times able to keep you safe from the lions
 then daniel said to the king o king have life for ever
 my god has sent his angel to keep the lions mouths shut and they have done me no damage because i was seen to be without sin before him and further before you o king i have done no wrong
 then the king was very glad and gave orders for them to take daniel up out of the hole so daniel was taken up out of the hole and he was seen to be untouched because he had faith in his god
 and at the kings order they took those men who had said evil against daniel and put them in the lions hole with their wives and their children and they had not got to the floor of the hole before the lions overcame them and all their bones were broken
 then king darius sent a letter to all the peoples nations and languages living in all the earth may your peace be increased
 it is my order that in all the kingdom of which i am ruler men are to be shaking with fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god unchanging for ever and his kingdom is one which will never come to destruction his rule will go on to the end
 he gives salvation and makes men free from danger and does signs and wonders in heaven and earth who has kept daniel safe from the power of the lions
 so this daniel did well in the kingdom of darius and in the kingdom of cyrus the persian
 in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel saw a dream and visions came into his head on his bed then he put the dream in writing
 i had a vision by night and saw the four winds of heaven violently moving the great sea
 and four great beasts came up from the sea different one from another
 the first was like a lion and had eagles wings while i was watching its wings were pulled off and it was lifted up from the earth and placed on two feet like a man and a mans heart was given to it
 and i saw another beast like a bear and it was lifted up on one side and three side bones were in its mouth between its teeth and they said to it up  take much flesh
 after this i saw another beast like a leopard which had on its back four wings like those of a bird and the beast had four heads and the power of a ruler was given to it
 after this in my vision of the night i saw a fourth beast a thing causing fear and very troubling full of power and very strong and it had great iron teeth it took its food crushing some of it to bits and stamping down the rest with its feet it was different from all the beasts before it and it had ten horns
 i was watching the horns with care and i saw another coming up among them a little one before which three of the first horns were pulled up by the roots and there were eyes like a mans eyes in this horn and a mouth saying great things
 i went on looking till the seats of kings were placed and one like a very old man took his seat his clothing was white as snow and the hair of his head was like clean wool his seat was flames of fire and its wheels burning fire
 a stream of fire was flowing and coming out from before him a thousand thousands were his servants and ten thousand times ten thousand were in their places before him the judge was seated and the books were open
 then i saw  because of the voice of the great words which the horn said  i saw till the beast was put to death and its body was given to destruction and the beast was given to the burning of fire
 as for the rest of the beasts their authority was taken away but they let them go on living for a measure of time
 i saw in visions of the night and there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like a man and he came to the one who was very old and they took him near before him
 and to him was given authority and glory and a kingdom and all peoples nations and languages were his servants his authority is an eternal authority which will not come to an end and his kingdom is one which will not come to destruction
 as for me daniel my spirit was pained because of this and the visions of my head were troubling me
 i came near to one of those who were waiting there questioning him about what all this was and he said to me that he would make clear to me the sense of these things
 these great beasts are four kings who will be cut off from the earth
 but the saints of the most high will take the kingdom and it will be theirs for ever even for ever and ever
 then it was my desire to have certain knowledge about the fourth beast which was different from all the others a cause of great fear whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass who took his food crushing some of it to bits and stamping on the rest with his feet
 and about the ten horns on his head and the other which came up causing the fall of three that horn which had eyes and a mouth saying great things which seemed to be greater than the other horns
 and i saw how that horn made war on the saints and overcame them
 till he came who was very old and the decision was made and the authority was given to the saints of the most high and the time came when the saints took the kingdom
 this is what he said the fourth beast is a fourth kingdom which will come on earth different from all the kingdoms and it will overcome all the earth crushing it down and smashing it
 and as for the ten horns out of this kingdom ten kings will come to power and after them another will come up he will be different from the first ones and will put down three kings
 and he will say words against the most high attempting to put an end to the saints of the most high and he will have the idea of changing times and law and the saints will be given into his hands for a time and times and half a time
 but the judge will be seated and they will put an end to his authority to overcome it and send complete destruction on it
 and the kingdom and the authority and the power of the kingdoms under all the heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the most high his kingdom is an eternal kingdom and all powers will be his servants and do his pleasure
 here is the end of the account as for me daniel i was greatly troubled by my thoughts and the colour went from my face but i kept the thing in my heart
 in the third year of the rule of belshazzar the king a vision was seen by me daniel after the one i saw at first
 and i saw in the vision and when i saw it i was in the strong town shushan which is in the country of elam and in the vision i was by the water door of the ulai
 and lifting up my eyes i saw there before the stream a male sheep with two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other the higher one coming up last
 i saw the sheep pushing to the west and to the north and to the south and no beasts were able to keep their place before him and no one was able to get people out of his power but he did whatever his pleasure was and made himself great
 and while i was giving thought to this i saw a he goat coming from the west over the face of all the earth without touching the earth and the he goat had a great horn between his eyes
 and he came to the two horned sheep which i saw before the stream rushing at him in the heat of his power
 and i saw him come right up to the sheep and he was moved with wrath against him attacking the sheep so that his two horns were broken and the sheep had not strength to keep his place before him but was pushed down on the earth and crushed under his feet and there was no one to get the sheep out of his power
 and the he goat became very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and in its place came up four other horns turned to the four winds of heaven
 and out of one of them came another horn a little one which became very great stretching to the south and to the east and to the beautiful land
 and it became great even as high as the army of heaven pulling down some of the army even of the stars to the earth and crushing them under its feet
 it made itself great even as great as the lord of the army and by it the regular burned offering was taken away and the place overturned and the holy place made waste
  against the regular burned offering and  crushed down to the earth and it did its pleasure and things went well for it
 then there came to my ears the voice of a holy one talking and another holy one said to that certain one who was talking how long will the vision be while the regular burned offering is taken away and the unclean thing causing fear is put up and the holy place crushed under foot
 and he said to him for two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings then the holy place will be made clean
 and it came about that when i daniel had seen this vision i had a desire for the sense of it to be unfolded and i saw one before me in the form of a man
 and the voice of a man came to my ears between the sides of the ulai crying out and saying gabriel make the vision clear to this man
 so he came and took his place near where i was and when he came i was full of fear and went down on my face but he said to me let it be clear to you o son of man for the vision has to do with the time of the end
 now while he was talking to me i went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth but touching me he put me on my feet where i had been
 and he said see i will make clear to you what is to come in the later time of the wrath for it has to do with the fixed time of the end
 the sheep which you saw with two horns they are the kings of media and persia
 and the he goat is the king of greece and the great horn between his eyes is the first king
 and as for that which was broken in place of which four came up four kingdoms will come up from his nation but not with his power
 and in the later years of their kingdom when their evil doings have become complete there will come up a king full of pride and expert in dark sayings
 and his power will be great and he will be purposing strange things and all will go well for him and he will do his pleasure and he will send destruction on the strong ones
 and his designs will be turned against the holy people causing deceit to do well in his hand in his heart he will make himself great and send destruction on numbers who are living unconscious of their danger and he will put himself up against the prince of princes but he will be broken though not by mens hands
 and the vision of evenings and mornings which has been talked of is true and keep the vision secret for it has to do with the far off future
 and i daniel was ill for some days then i got up and did the kings business and i was full of wonder at the vision but no one was able to give the sense of it
 in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of the medes who was made king over the kingdom of the chaldaeans
 in the first year of his rule i daniel saw clearly from the books the number of years given by the word of the lord to the prophet jeremiah in which the making waste of jerusalem was to be complete that is seventy years
 and turning my face to the lord god i gave myself up to prayer requesting his grace going without food in haircloth and dust
 and i made prayer to the lord my god putting our sins before him and said o lord the great god greatly to be feared keeping your agreement and mercy with those who have love for you and do your orders
 we are sinners acting wrongly and doing evil we have gone against you turning away from your orders and from your laws
 we have not given ear to your servants the prophets who said words in your name to our kings and our rulers and our fathers and all the people of the land
 o lord righteousness is yours but shame is on us even to this day and on the men of judah and the people of jerusalem and on all israel those who are near and those who are far off in all the countries where you have sent them because of the sin which they have done against you
 o lord shame is on us on our kings and our rulers and our fathers because of our sin against you
 with the lord our god are mercies and forgiveness for we have gone against him
 and have not given ear to the voice of the lord our god to go in the way of his laws which he put before us by the mouth of his servants the prophets
 and all israel have been sinners against your law turning away so as not to give ear to your voice and the curse has been let loose on us and the oath recorded in the law of moses the servant of god for we have done evil against him
 and he has given effect to his words which he said against us and against those who were our judges by sending a great evil on us for under all heaven there has not been done what has been done to jerusalem
 as it was recorded in the law of moses all this evil has come on us but we have made no prayer for grace from the lord our god that we might be turned from our evil doings and come to true wisdom
 so the lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us for the lord our god is upright in all his acts which he has done and we have not given ear to his voice
 and now o lord our god who took your people out of the land of egypt with a strong hand and made a great name for yourself even to this day we are sinners we have done evil
 o lord because of your righteousness let your wrath and your passion be turned away from your town jerusalem your holy mountain because through our sins and the evil doing of our fathers jerusalem and your people have become a cause of shame to all who are round about us
 and now give ear o our god to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste because of your servants o lord
 o my god let your ear be turned and give hearing let your eyes be open and see how we have been made waste and the town which is named by your name for we are not offering our prayers before you because of our righteousness but because of your great mercies
 o lord give ear o lord have forgiveness o lord take note and do let there be no more waiting for the honour of your name o my god because your town and your people are named by your name
 and while i was still saying these words in prayer and putting my sins and the sins of my people israel before the lord and requesting grace from the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god
 even while i was still in prayer the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering
 and teaching me and talking to me he said o daniel i have come now to give you wisdom
 at the first word of your prayer a word went out and i have come to give you knowledge for you are a man dearly loved so give thought to the word and let the vision be clear to you
 seventy weeks have been fixed for your people and your holy town to let wrongdoing be complete and sin come to its full limit and for the clearing away of evil doing and the coming in of eternal righteousness so that the vision and the word of the prophet may be stamped as true and to put the holy oil on a most holy place
 have then the certain knowledge that from the going out of the word for the building again of jerusalem till the coming of a prince on whom the holy oil has been put will be seven weeks in sixty two weeks its building will be complete with square and earthwork
 and at the end of the times even after the sixty two weeks one on whom the holy oil has been put will be cut off and have no  and the town and the holy place will be made waste together with a prince and the end will come with an overflowing of waters and even to the end there will be war the making waste which has been fixed
 and a strong order will be sent out against the great number for one week and so for half of the week the offering and the meal offering will come to an end and in its place will be an unclean thing causing fear till the destruction which has been fixed is let loose on him who has made waste
 these are the words which moses said to all israel on the far side of jordan in the waste land in the arabah opposite suph between paran on the one side and tophel laban hazeroth and dizahab on the other
 it is eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount seir to kadesh barnea
 now in the fortieth year on the first day of the eleventh month moses gave to the children of israel all the orders which the lord had given him for them
 after he had overcome sihon king of the amorites ruling in heshbon and og king of bashan ruling in ashtaroth at edrei
 on the far side of jordan in the land of moab moses gave the people this law saying
 the lord our god said to us in horeb you have been long enough in this mountain
 make a move now and go on your way into the hill country of the amorites and the places near it in the arabah and the hill country and in the lowlands and in the south and by the seaside all the land of the canaanites and lebanon as far as the great river the river euphrates
 see all the land is before you go in and take for yourselves the land which the lord gave by an oath to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob and to their seed after them
 at that time i said to you i am not able to undertake the care of you by myself
 the lord your god has given you increase and now you are like the stars of heaven in number
 may the lord the god of your fathers make you a thousand times greater in number than you are and give you his blessing as he has said 
 how is it possible for me by myself to be responsible for you and undertake the weight of all your troubles and your arguments
 take for yourselves men who are wise far seeing and respected among you from your tribes and i will make them rulers over you
 and you made answer and said to me it is good for us to do as you say
 so i took the heads of your tribes wise men and respected and made them rulers over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens and overseers of your tribes
 and at that time i gave orders to your judges saying let all questions between your brothers come before you for hearing and give decisions uprightly between a man and his brother or one from another nation who is with him
 in judging do not let a mans position have any weight with you give hearing equally to small and great have no fear of any man for it is god who is judge and any cause in which you are not able to give a decision you are to put before me and i will give it a hearing
 and at that time i gave you all the orders which you were to do
 then we went on from horeb through all that great and cruel waste which you saw on our way to the hill country of the amorites as the lord gave us orders and we came to kadesh barnea
 and i said to you you have come to the hill country of the amorites which the lord our god is giving us
 see now the lord your god has put the land into your hands go up and take it as the lord the god of your fathers has said to you have no fear and do not be troubled
 and you came near to me every one of you and said let us send men before us to go through the land with care and give us an account of the way we are to go and the towns to which we will come
 and what you said seemed good to me and i took twelve men from among you one from every tribe
 and they went up into the hill country and came to the valley of eshcol and saw what was there
 and taking in their hands some of the fruit of the land they came down again to us and gave us their account saying it is a good land which the lord our god is giving us
 but going against the order of the lord your god you would not go up
 and you made an angry outcry in your tents and said in his hate for us the lord has taken us out of the land of egypt to give us up into the hands of the amorites for our destruction
 where are we going up our brothers have made our hearts feeble with fear by saying the people are greater and taller than we are and the towns are great and walled up to heaven and more than this we have seen the sons of the anakim there
 then i said to you have no fear of them
 the lord your god who goes before you will be fighting for you and will do such wonders as he did for you in egypt before your eyes
 and in the waste land where you have seen how the lord was supporting you as a man does his son in all your journeying till you came to this place
 but for all this you had no faith in the lord your god
 who goes before you on your way looking for a place where you may put up your tents in fire by night lighting up the way you are to go and in a cloud by day
 and the lord hearing your words was angry and said with an oath
 truly not one of this evil generation will see that good land which i said i would give to your fathers
 but only caleb the son of jephunneh he will see it and to him and to his children i will give the land over which his feet have gone because he has been true to the lord with all his heart
 and in addition the lord was angry with me because of you saying you yourself will not go into it
 joshua the son of nun your servant he will go into the land say to him that he is to be strong for he will be israels guide into their heritage
 and your little ones who you said would come into strange hands your children who now have no knowledge of good or evil they will go into that land and to them i will give it and it will be theirs
 but as for you go back journeying into the waste land by the way of the red sea
 then you said to me we have done evil against the lord we will go up to the attack as the lord our god has given us orders and arming yourselves every one you made ready to go up without care into the hill country
 and the lord said to me say to them do not go up to the attack for i am not among you and you will be overcome by those who are against you
 this i said to you but you gave no attention and went against the orders of the lord and in your pride went up into the hill country
 and the amorites who were in the hill country came out against you and put you to flight rushing after you like bees and overcame you in seir driving you even as far as hormah
 and you came back weeping before the lord but the lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you
 so you were kept waiting in kadesh for a long time
 at that time the lord said to me make two other stones cut like the first two and come up to me on the mountain and make an ark of wood
 and i will put on the stones the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you and you are to put them into the ark
 so i made an ark of hard wood and had two stones cut like the others and went up the mountain with the stones in my hands
 and he put on the stones as in the first writing the ten rules which the lord gave you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the great meeting and the lord gave the stones to me
 and turning round i came down from the mountain and put the stones in the ark which i had made and there they are as the lord gave me orders
  and the children of israel went on from beeroth bene jaakan to moserah there death came to aaron and he was put to rest in the earth and eleazar his son took his place as priest
 from there they went on to gudgodah and from gudgodah to jotbathah a land of streams of water
 at that time the lord had the tribe of levi marked out to take up the ark of the lords agreement to be before the lord and to do his work and to give blessings in his name to this day
 for this reason levi has no part or heritage for himself among his brothers the lord is his heritage as the lord your god said to him 
 and i was in the mountain as at the first time for forty days and forty nights and again the ears of the lord were open to my prayer and he did not send destruction on you
 then the lord said to me get up and go on your journey before the people so that they may go in and take the land which i said in my oath to their fathers that i would give them
 and now israel what would the lord your god have you do but to go in the fear of the lord your god walking in all his ways and loving him and doing his pleasure with all your heart and all your soul
 doing the orders of the lord and keeping his laws which i give you this day for your good
 the lord your god is ruler of heaven of the heaven of heavens and of the earth with everything in it
 but the lord had delight in your fathers and love for them marking out for himself their seed after them even you from all peoples as at this day
 let your circumcision be of the heart and put away your pride
 for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords the great god strong in power and greatly to be feared who has no respect for any mans position and takes no rewards
 judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country
 so be kind to the man from a strange country who is living among you for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of egypt
 let the fear of the lord your god be before you give him worship and be true to him at all times taking your oaths in his name
 he is your god the god of your praise your god who has done for you all these works of power which your eyes have seen
 your fathers went down into egypt with seventy persons and now the lord your god has made you like the stars of heaven in number
 so have love for the lord your god and give him worship and keep his laws and his decisions and his orders at all times
 and be certain in your minds this day for these words are not said to your children who have had no experience of the training of the lord your god and who have not seen his great power or his strong hand and his stretched out arm
 or his signs and wonders which he did in egypt to pharaoh king of egypt and all his land
 and what he did to the army of egypt to their horses and their war carriages how he made the waters of the red sea come up over them when they went after you and how the lord put an end to them even to this day
 and what he did for you in the waste land till you came to this place
 and what he did to dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben when they went down into the open mouth of the earth with their families and their tents and every living thing which was theirs before the eyes of all israel
 but your eyes have seen all the great works of the lord which he has done
 so keep all the orders which i give you today so that you may be strong and go in and take the land which is to be your heritage
 and that your days may be long in the land which the lord gave by an oath to your fathers and to their seed after them a land flowing with milk and honey
 for the land where you are going is not like the land of egypt from which you have come where you put in your seeds watering them with your foot like a planted garden
 but the land where you are going is a land of hills and valleys drinking in the rain of heaven
 a land cared for by the lord your god the eyes of the lord your god are on it at all times from one end of the year to the other
 and it will be that if you truly give ear to the orders which i put before you this day loving the lord your god and worshipping him with all your heart and all your soul
 then i will send rain on your land at the right time the early rains and the late rains so that you may get in your grain and your wine and your oil
 and i will give grass in your fields for your cattle so that you may have food in full measure
 but take care that your hearts are not turned to false ways so that you become servants and worshippers of other gods
 for if you do so the wrath of the lord will be burning against you and the heaven will be shut up so that there is no rain and the land will give no fruit and in a very little time you will be cut off from the good land which the lord is giving you
 so keep these words deep in your heart and in your soul and have them fixed on your hand for a sign and marked on your brow
 teaching them to your children and talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way when you go to sleep and when you get up
 writing them on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns
 so that your days and the days of your children may be long in the land which the lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give them like the days of the eternal heavens
 for if you take care to keep all the orders which i give you and to do them loving the lord your god and walking in all his ways and being true to him
 then the lord will send these nations in flight before you and you will take the lands of nations greater and stronger than yourselves
 every place where you put your foot will be yours from the waste land and lebanon from the river the river euphrates as far as the great sea will be the limits of your land
 all people will give way before you for the lord your god will put the fear of you on all the land through which you go as he has said
 today i put before you a blessing and a curse
 the blessing if you give ear to the orders of the lord your god which i give you this day
 and the curse if you do not give ear to the orders of the lord your god but let yourselves be turned from the way which i have put before you this day and go after other gods which are not yours
 and when the lord your god has taken you into the land of your heritage you are to put the blessing on mount gerizim and the curse on mount ebal
 are they not on the other side of jordan looking west in the land of the canaanites living in the arabah opposite gilgal by the holy tree of moreh
 for you are about to go over jordan to take the heritage which the lord your god is giving you and it will be your resting place
 and you are to take care to keep all the laws and the decisions which i put before you today
 these are the laws and the decisions which you are to keep with care in the land which the lord the god of your fathers has given you to be your heritage all the days of your life on earth
 you are to give up to the curse all those places where the nations whom you are driving out gave worship to their gods on the high mountains and the hills and under every green tree
 their altars and their pillars are to be broken down and their holy trees burned with fire and the images of their gods cut down you are to take away their names out of that place
 do not so to the lord your god
 but let your hearts be turned to the place which will be marked out by the lord your god among your tribes to put his name there
 and there you are to take your burned offerings and other offerings and the tenth part of your goods and the offerings to be lifted up to the lord and the offerings of your oaths and those which you give freely from the impulse of your hearts and the first births among your herds and your flocks
 there you and all your families are to make a feast before the lord your god with joy in everything to which you put your hand because the lord has given you his blessing
 you are not to do things then in the way in which we now do them here every man as it seems right to him
 for you have not come to the rest and the heritage which the lord your god is giving you
 but when you have gone over jordan and are living in the land which the lord your god is giving you as your heritage and when he has given you rest from all those on every side who are fighting against you and you are living there safely
 then there will be a place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place for his name and there you will take all the things which i give you orders to take your burned offerings and other offerings and the tenth part of your goods and the offerings to be lifted up and the offerings of your oaths which you make to the lord
 and you will be glad before the lord your god you and your sons and your daughters and your men servants and your women servants and the levite who is with you in your house because he has no part or heritage among you
 take care that you do not make your burned offerings in any place you see
 but in the place marked out by the lord in one of your tribes there let your burned offerings be offered and there do what i have given you orders to do
 only you may put to death animals such as the gazelle or the roe for your food in any of your towns at the desire of your soul in keeping with the blessing of the lord your god which he has given you the unclean and the clean may take of it
 but you may not take the blood for food it is to be drained out on the earth like water
 in your towns you are not to take as food the tenth part of your grain or of your wine or your oil or the first births of your herds or of your flocks or anything offered under an oath or freely offered to the lord or given as a lifted offering
 but they will be your food before the lord your god in the place of his selection where you may make a feast of them with your son and your daughter and your man servant and your woman servant and the levite who is living with you and you will have joy before the lord your god in everything to which you put your hand
 see that you do not give up caring for the levite as long as you are living in your land
 when the lord your god makes wide the limit of your land as he has said and you say i will take flesh for my food because you have a desire for it then you may take whatever flesh you have a desire for
 if the place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place for his name is far away from you then take from your herds and from your flocks which the lord has given you as i have said and have a meal of it in the towns where you may be living
 it will be your food like the gazelle and the roe the unclean and the clean may take of it
 but see that you do not take the blood for food for the blood is the life and you may not make use of the life as food with the flesh
 do not take it for food but let it be drained out on the earth like water
 do not take it for food so that it may be well for you and for your children after you while you do what is right in the eyes of the lord
 but the holy things which you have and the offerings of your oaths you are to take to the place which will be marked out by the lord
 offering the flesh and the blood of your burned offerings on the altar of the lord your god and the blood of your offerings is to be drained out on the altar of the lord your god and the flesh will be your food
 take note of all these orders i am giving you and give attention to them so that it may be well for you and for your children after you for ever while you do what is good and right in the eyes of the lord your god
 when the people of the land where you are going have been cut off before you by the lord your god and you have taken their land and are living in it
 after their destruction take care that you do not go in their ways and that you do not give thought to their gods saying how did these nations give worship to their gods i will do as they did
 do not so to the lord your god for everything which is disgusting to the lord and hated by him they have done in honour of their gods even burning their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods
 you are to keep with care all the words i give you making no addition to them and taking nothing from them
 if ever you have among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he gives you a sign or a wonder
 and the sign or the wonder takes place and he says to you let us go after other gods which are strange to you and give them worship
 then give no attention to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god is testing you to see if all the love of your heart and soul is given to him
 but keep on in the ways of the lord your god fearing him and keeping his orders and hearing his voice worshipping him and being true to him
 and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams is to be put to death for his words were said with the purpose of turning you away from the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt and made you free from the prison house and of forcing you out of the way in which the lord your god has given you orders to go so you are to put away the evil from among you
 if your brother the son of your mother or your son or your daughter or the wife of your heart or the friend who is as dear to you as your life working on you secretly says to you let us go and give worship to other gods strange to you and to your fathers
 gods of the peoples round about you near or far from one end of the earth to the other
 do not be guided by him or give attention to him have no pity on him or mercy and give him no cover
 but put him to death without question let your hand be the first stretched out against him to put him to death and then the hands of all the people
 let him be stoned with stones till he is dead because it was his purpose to make you false to the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 and all israel hearing of it will be full of fear and no one will again do such evil as this among you
 and if word comes to you in one of the towns which the lord your god is giving you for your resting place
 that good for nothing persons have gone out from among you turning the people of their town from the right way and saying let us go and give worship to other gods of whom you have no knowledge
 then let a full search be made and let questions be put with care and if it is true and certain that such a disgusting thing has been done among you
 then take up arms against the people of that town and give it up to the curse with all its cattle and everything in it
 and take all the goods into the middle of its open space burning the town and all its property with fire as an offering to the lord your god it is to be a waste for ever there is to be no more building there
 keep not a thing of what is cursed for yourselves so the lord may be turned away from the heat of his wrath and have mercy on you and give you increase as he said in his oath to your fathers
 so long as you give ear to the voice of the lord your god and keep all his orders which i give you today and do what is right in the eyes of the lord your god
 you are the children of the lord your god you are not to make cuts on your bodies or take off the hair on your brows in honour of the dead
 for you are a holy people to the lord your god and the lord has taken you to be his special people out of all the nations on the face of the earth
 no disgusting thing may be your food
 these are the beasts which you may have for food the ox the sheep and the goat
 the hart the gazelle and the roe the mountain goat and the pygarg and the antelope and the mountain sheep
 any beast which has a division in the horn of its foot and whose food comes back into its mouth to be crushed again may be used for food
 but even among these there are some which may not be used for food such as the camel the hare and the coney which are unclean to you because though their food comes back the horn of their feet is not parted in two
 and the pig is unclean to you because though it has a division in the horn of its foot its food does not come back their flesh may not be used for food or their dead bodies touched by you
 and of the things living in the waters you may take all those who have wings for swimming with and skins formed of thin plates
 but any which have no skin plates or wings for swimming you may not take they are unclean for you
 all clean birds may be used for food
 but these birds you may not take the eagle and the gier eagle and the ospray
 the falcon and the kite and birds of that sort
 every raven and all birds of that sort
 and the ostrich and the night hawk and the sea hawk and birds of that sort
 the little owl and the great owl and the water hen
 and the pelican and the vulture and the cormorant
 the stork and the heron and birds of that sort and the hoopoe and the bat
 every winged thing which goes flat on the earth is unclean to you and may not be used as food
 but all clean birds you may take
 you may not have as food anything which has come to a natural death the man from another country who is living with you may take it for food or you may get a price for it from one of another nation for you are a holy people to the lord your god the young goat is not to be cooked in its mothers milk
 put on one side a tenth of all the increase of your seed produced year by year
 and make a feast before the lord your god in the place which is to be marked out where his name will be for ever of the tenth part of your grain and your wine and your oil and the first births of your herds and your flocks so that you may have the fear of the lord your god in your hearts at all times
 and if the way is so long that you are not able to take these things to the place marked out by the lord your god for his name when he has given you his blessing because it is far away from you
 then let these things be exchanged for money and taking the money in your hand go to the place marked out by the lord your god for himself
 and with the money get whatever you have a desire for oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink whatever your souls desire may be and make a feast there before the lord your god and be glad you and all your house
 and give a thought to the levite who is living among you for he has no part or heritage in the land
 at the end of every three years take a tenth part of all your increase for that year and put it in store inside your walls
 and the levite because he has no part or heritage in the land and the man from a strange country and the child who has no father and the widow who are living among you will come and take food and have enough and so the blessing of the lord your god will be on you in everything you do
 at the end of every seven years there is to be a general forgiveness of debt
 this is how it is to be done every creditor is to give up his right to whatever he has let his neighbour have he is not to make his neighbour his countryman give it back because a general forgiveness has been ordered by the lord
 a man of another nation may be forced to make payment of his debt but if your brother has anything of yours let it go
 but there will be no poor among you for the lord will certainly give you his blessing in the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage
 if only you give ear to the voice of the lord your god and take care to keep all these orders which i give you today
 for the lord your god will give you his blessing as he has said you will let other nations have the use of your money but you will not make use of theirs you will be rulers over a number of nations but they will not be your rulers
 if in any of your towns in the land which the lord your god is giving you there is a poor man one of your countrymen do not let your heart be hard or your hand shut to him
 but let your hand be open to give him the use of whatever he is in need of
 and see that there is no evil thought in your heart moving you to say to yourself the seventh year the year of forgiveness is near and so looking coldly on your poor countryman you give him nothing and he will make an outcry to the lord against you and it will be judged as sin in you
 but it is right for you to give to him without grief of heart for because of this the blessing of the lord your god will be on all your work and on everything to which you put your hand
 for there will never be a time when there are no poor in the land and so i give orders to you let your hand be open to your countrymen to those who are poor and in need in your land
 if one of your countrymen a hebrew man or woman becomes your servant for a price and does work for you six years in the seventh year let him go free
 and when you make him free do not let him go away with nothing in his hands
 but give him freely from your flock and from your grain and your wine in the measure of the wealth which the lord your god has given you you are to give to him
 and keep in mind that you yourself were a servant in the land of egypt and the lord your god made you free so i give you this order today
 but if he says to you i have no desire to go away from you because you and your family are dear to him and he is happy with you
 then take a sharp pointed instrument driving it through his ear into the door and he will be your servant for ever and you may do the same for your servant girl
 let it not seem hard to you that you have to send him away free for he has been working for you for six years which is twice the regular time for a servant and the blessing of the lord your god will be on you in everything you do
 all the first males to come to birth in your herd and your flock are to be holy to the lord your god the first birth of your ox is not to be used for work the wool of your first lamb is not to be cut
 but year by year you and all your house are to take a meal of it before the lord in the place of his selection
 but if it has any mark on it if it is blind or has damaged legs or if there is anything wrong with it it may not be offered to the lord your god
 it may be used for food in your houses the unclean and the clean may take of it as of the gazelle and the roe
 only do not take its blood for food but let it be drained out on the earth like water
 take note of the month of abib and keep the passover to the lord your god for in the month of abib the lord your god took you out of egypt by night
 the passover offering from your flock or your herd is to be given to the lord your god in the place marked out by him as the resting place of his name
 take no leavened bread with it for seven days let your food be unleavened bread that is the bread of sorrow for you came out of the land of egypt quickly so the memory of that day when you came out of the land of egypt will be with you all your life
 for seven days let no leaven be used through all your land and nothing of the flesh which is put to death in the evening of the first day is to be kept through the night till morning
 the passover offering is not to be put to death in any of the towns which the lord your god gives you
 but in the place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place of his name there you are to put the passover to death in the evening at sundown at that time of the year when you came out of egypt
 it is to be cooked and taken as food in the place marked out by the lord and in the morning you are to go back to your tents
 for six days let your food be unleavened bread and on the seventh day there is to be a holy meeting to the lord your god no work is to be done
 let seven weeks be numbered from the first day when the grain is cut
 then keep the feast of weeks to the lord your god with an offering freely given to him from the wealth he has given you
 then you are to be glad before the lord your god you and your son and your daughter your man servant and your woman servant and the levite who is with you and the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow who are living among you in the place marked out by the lord your god as a resting place for his name
 and you will keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of egypt and you will take care to keep all these laws
 you are to keep the feast of tents for seven days after you have got in all your grain and made your wine
 you are to keep the feast with joy you and your son and your daughter your man servant and your woman servant and the levite and the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow who are living among you
 keep the feast to the lord your god for seven days in the place marked out by the lord because the blessing of the lord your god will be on all the produce of your land and all the work of your hands and you will have nothing but joy
 three times in the year let all your males come before the lord your god in the place named by him at the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tents and they are not to come before the lord with nothing in their hands
 every man is to give as he is able in the measure of the blessing which the lord your god has given you
 you are to make judges and overseers in all your towns which the lord your god gives you for every tribe and they are to be upright men judging the people in righteousness
 you are not to be moved in your judging by a mans position you are not to take rewards for rewards make the eyes of the wise man blind and the decisions of the upright false
 let righteousness be your guide so that you may have life and take for your heritage the land which the lord your god is giving you
 let no holy tree of any sort be planted by the altar of the lord your god which you will make
 you are not to put up stone pillars for they are hated by the lord your god
 no ox or sheep which has a mark on it or is damaged in any way may be offered to the lord your god for that is disgusting to the lord your god
 if there is any man or woman among you in any of the towns which the lord your god gives you who does evil in the eyes of the lord your god sinning against his agreement
 by becoming a servant of other gods and worshipping them or the sun or the moon or all the stars of heaven against my orders
 if word of this comes to your ears then let this thing be looked into with care and if there is no doubt that it is true and such evil has been done in israel
 then you are to take the man or woman who has done the evil to the public place of your town and they are to be stoned with stones till they are dead
 on the word of two or three witnesses a man may be given the punishment of death but he is not to be put to death on the word of one witness
 the hands of the witnesses will be the first to put him to death and after them the hands of all the people so you are to put away the evil from among you
 if you are not able to give a decision as to who is responsible for a death or who is right in a cause or who gave the first blow in a fight and there is a division of opinion about it in your town then go to the place marked out by the lord your god
 and come before the priests the levites or before him who is judge at the time and they will go into the question and give you a decision
 and you are to be guided by the decision they give in the place named by the lord and do whatever they say
 acting in agreement with their teaching and the decision they give not turning to one side or the other from the word they have given you
 and any man who in his pride will not give ear to the priest whose place is there before the lord your god or to the judge is to be put to death you are to put away the evil from israel
 and all the people hearing of it will be full of fear and put away their pride
 when you have come into the land which the lord your god is giving you and have taken it for a heritage and are living in it if it is your desire to have a king over you like the other nations round about you
 then see that you take as your king the man named by the lord your god let your king be one of your countrymen not a man of another nation who is not one of yourselves
 and he is not to get together a great army of horses for himself or make the people go back to egypt to get horses for him because the lord has said you will never again go back that way
 and he is not to have a great number of wives for fear that his heart may be turned away or great wealth of silver and gold
 and when he has taken his place on the seat of his kingdom he is to make in a book a copy of this law from that which the priests the levites have in their care
 and it is to be with him for his reading all the days of his life so that he may be trained in the fear of the lord his god to keep and do all the words of this teaching and these laws
 so that his heart may not be lifted up over his countrymen and he may not be turned away from the orders to one side or the other but that his life and the lives of his children may be long in his kingdom in israel
 the priests the levites that is all the tribe of levi will have no part or heritage with israel their food and their heritage will be the offerings of the lord made by fire
 and they will have no heritage among their countrymen the lord is their heritage as he has said to them
 and this is to be the priests right those who make an offering of a sheep or an ox are to give to the priest the top part of the leg and the two sides of the head and the stomach
 and in addition you are to give him the first of your grain and wine and oil and the first wool cut from your sheep
 for he and his sons after him for ever have been marked out by the lord your god from all your tribes to do the work of priests in the name of the lord
 and if a levite moved by a strong desire comes from any town in all israel where he is living to the place marked out by the lord
 then he will do the work of a priest in the name of the lord his god with all his brothers the levites who are there before the lord
 his food will be the same as theirs in addition to what has come to him as the price of his property
 when you have come into the land which the lord your god is giving you do not take as your example the disgusting ways of those nations
 let there not be seen among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter go through the fire or anyone using secret arts or a maker of strange sounds or a reader of signs or any wonder worker
 or anyone using secret force on people or putting questions to a spirit or having secret knowledge or going to the dead for directions
 for all who do such things are disgusting to the lord and because of these disgusting things the lord your god is driving them out before you
 you are to be upright in heart before the lord your god
 for these nations whose land you are taking give attention to readers of signs and to those using secret arts but the lord your god will not let you do so
 the lord your god will give you a prophet from among your people like me you will give ear to him
 in answer to the request you made to the lord your god in horeb on the day of the great meeting when you said let not the voice of the lord my god come to my ears again and let me not see this great fire any more or death will overtake me
 then the lord said to me what they have said is well said
 i will give them a prophet from among themselves like you and i will put my words in his mouth and he will say to them whatever i give him orders to say
 and whoever does not give ear to my words which he will say in my name will be responsible to me
 but the prophet who takes it on himself to say words in my name which i have not given him orders to say or who says anything in the name of other gods will come to his death
 and if you say in your hearts how are we to be certain that the word does not come from the lord
 when a prophet makes a statement in the name of the lord if what he says does not take place and his words do not come true then his word is not the word of the lord the words of the prophet were said in the pride of his heart and you are to have no fear of him
 when the nations whose land the lord your god is giving you have been cut off by him and you have taken their place and are living in their towns and in their houses
 you are to have three towns marked out in the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage
 you are to make ready a way and see that the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage is marked out into three parts to which any taker of life may go in flight
 this is to be the rule for anyone who goes in flight there after causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate
 for example if a man goes into the woods with his neighbour for the purpose of cutting down trees and when he takes his axe to give a blow to the tree the head of the axe comes off and falling on to his neighbour gives him a wound causing his death then the man may go in flight to one of these towns and be safe
 for if not he who has the right of punishment may go running after the taker of life in the heat of his wrath and overtake him because the way is long and give him a death blow though it is not right for him to be put to death because he was not moved by hate
 and so i am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose
 and if the lord your god makes wide the limits of your land as he said in his oath to your fathers and gives you all the land which he undertook to give to your fathers
 if you keep and do all these orders which i give you today loving the lord your god and walking ever in his ways then let three more towns in addition to these three be marked out for you
 so that in all your land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage no man may be wrongly put to death for which you will be responsible
 but if any man has hate for his neighbour and waiting for him secretly makes an attack on him and gives him a blow causing his death and then goes in flight to one of these towns
 the responsible men of his town are to send and take him and give him up to the one who has the right of punishment to be put to death
 have no pity on him so that israel may be clear from the crime of putting a man to death without cause and it will be well for you
 your neighbours landmark which was put in its place by the men of old times is not to be moved or taken away in the land of your heritage which the lord your god is giving you
 one witness may not make a statement against a man in relation to any sin or wrongdoing which he has done on the word of two or three witnesses a question is to be judged
 if a false witness makes a statement against a man saying that he has done wrong
 then the two men between whom the argument has taken place are to come before the lord before the priests and judges who are then in power
 and the judges will have the question looked into with care and if the witness is seen to be false and to have made a false statement against his brother
 then do to him what it was his purpose to do to his brother and so put away the evil from among you
 and the rest of the people hearing of it will be full of fear and never again do such evil among you
 have no pity let life be given for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
 then we went back journeying into the waste land by the way to the red sea as the lord had said to me and we were a long time going round mount seir
 and the lord said to me
 you have been journeying round this mountain long enough now go to the north
 and give the people orders saying you are about to go through the land of your brothers the children of esau who are living in seir and they will have fear of you so take care what you do
 make no attack on them for i will not give you any of their land not even space enough for a mans foot because i have given mount seir to esau for his heritage
 you may get food for your needs from them for a price and water for drinking
 for the blessing of the lord your god has been on you in all the work of your hands he has knowledge of your wanderings through this great waste these forty years the lord your god has been with you and you have been short of nothing
 so we went on past our brothers the children of esau living in seir by the road through the arabah from elath and ezion geber and turning we went by the road through the waste land of moab
 and the lord said to me make no attack on moab and do not go to war with them for i will not give you any of his land because i have given ar to the children of lot for their heritage
  in the past the emim were living there a great people equal in numbers to the anakim and as tall
 they are numbered among the rephaim like the anakim but are named emim by the moabites
 and the horites in earlier times were living in seir but the children of esau took their place they sent destruction on them and took their land for themselves as israel did to the land of his heritage which the lord gave them 
 get up now and go over the stream zered so we went over the stream zered
 thirty eight years had gone by from the time when we came away from kadesh barnea till we went over the stream zered by that time all the generation of the men of war among us were dead as the lord had said
 for the hand of the lord was against them working their destruction till all were dead
 so when death had overtaken all the men of war among the people
 the word of the lord came to me saying
 you are about to go by ar the limit of the country of moab
 and when you come near the land of the children of ammon give them no cause of trouble and do not make war on them for i will not give you any of the land of the children of ammon for your heritage because i have given it to the children of lot
  that land is said to have been a land of the rephaim for rephaim had been living there in earlier times but they were named zamzummim by the ammonites
 they were a great people tall as the anakim and equal to them in number but the lord sent destruction on them and the children of ammon took their place living in their land
 as he did for the children of esau living in seir when he sent destruction on the horites before them and they took their land where they are living to this day
 and the avvim living in the small towns as far as gaza came to destruction by the hands of the caphtorim who came out from caphtor and took their land 
 get up now and go on your journey crossing over the valley of the arnon see i have given into your hands sihon the amorite king of heshbon and all his land go forward to make it yours and make war on him
 from now on i will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven who hearing of you will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you
 then from the waste land of kedemoth i sent representatives to sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying
 let me go through your land i will keep to the highway not turning to the right or to the left
 let me have food at a price for my needs and water for drinking only let me go through on foot
 as the children of esau did for me in seir and the moabites in ar till i have gone over jordan into the land which the lord our god is giving us
 but sihon king of heshbon would not let us go through for the lord your god made his spirit hard and his heart strong so that he might give him up into your hands as at this day
 and the lord said to me see from now on i have given sihon and his land into your hands go forward now to take his land and make it yours
 then sihon came out against us with all his people to make an attack on us at jahaz
 and the lord our god gave him into our hands and we overcame him and his sons and all his people
 at that time we took all his towns and gave them over to complete destruction together with men women and children we had no mercy on any
 only the cattle we took for ourselves with the goods from the towns we had taken
 from aroer on the edge of the valley of the arnon and from the town in the valley as far as gilead no town was strong enough to keep us out the lord our god gave them all into our hands
 but you did not go near the land of the children of ammon that is all the side of the river jabbok or the towns of the hill country wherever the lord our god had said we were not to go
 when you go out to war against other nations and come face to face with horses and war carriages and armies greater in number than yourselves have no fear of them for the lord your god is with you who took you up out of the land of egypt
 and when you are on the point of attacking let the priest come forward and say to the people
 give ear o israel today you are going forward to the fight let your heart be strong do not let uncontrolled fear overcome you because of those who are against you
 for the lord your god goes with you fighting for you to give you salvation from those who are against you
 and let the overseers say to the people if there is any man who has made for himself a new house and has not gone into it let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another may not take his house for himself
 or if any man has made a vine garden without taking the first fruits of it let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another may not be the first to make use of the fruit
 or if any man is newly married and has had no sex relations with his wife let him go back to his house so that in the event of his death in the fight another man may not take her
 and let the overseers go on to say to the people if there is any man whose heart is feeble with fear let him go back to his house before he makes the hearts of his countrymen feeble
 then after saying these words to the people let the overseers put captains over the army
 when you come to a town before attacking it make an offer of peace
 and if it gives you back an answer of peace opening its doors to you then all the people in it may be put to forced work as your servants
 if however it will not make peace with you but war then let it be shut in on all sides
 and when the lord your god has given it into your hands let every male in it be put to death without mercy
 but the women and the children and the cattle and everything in the town and all its wealth you may take for yourselves the wealth of your haters which the lord your god has given you will be your food
 so you are to do to all the towns far away which are not the towns of these nations
 but in the towns of these peoples whose land the lord your god is giving you for your heritage let no living thing be kept from death
 give them up to the curse the hittite the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite as the lord your god has given you orders
 so that you may not take them as your example and do all the disgusting things which they do in the worship of their gods so sinning against the lord your god
 if in war a town is shut in by your armies for a long time do not let its trees be cut down and made waste for their fruit will be your food are the trees of the countryside men for you to take up arms against them
 only those trees which you are certain are not used for food may be cut down and put to destruction and you are to make walls of attack against the town till it is taken
 if in the land which the lord your god is giving you you come across the dead body of a man in the open country and you have no idea who has put him to death
 then your responsible men and your judges are to come out and give orders for the distance from the dead body to the towns round about it to be measured
 and whichever town is nearest to the body the responsible men of that town are to take from the herd a young cow which has never been used for work or put under the yoke
 and they are to take the cow into a valley where there is flowing water and which is not ploughed or planted and there the neck of the cow is to be broken
 then the priests the sons of levi are to come near for they have been marked out by the lord your god to be his servants and to give blessings in the name of the lord and by their decision every argument and every blow is to be judged
 and all the responsible men of that town which is nearest to the dead man washing their hands over the cow whose neck was broken in the valley
 will say this death is not the work of our hands and our eyes have not seen it
 have mercy o lord on your people israel whom you have made free and take away from your people the crime of a death without cause then they will no longer be responsible for the mans death
 so you will take away the crime of a death without cause from among you when you do what is right in the eyes of the lord
 when you go out to war against other nations and the lord your god gives them up into your hands and you take them as prisoners
 if among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman and it is your desire to make her your wife
 then take her back to your house and let her hair and her nails be cut
 and let her take off the dress in which she was made prisoner and go on living in your house and weeping for her father and mother for a full month and after that you may go in to her and be her husband and she will be your wife
 but if you have no delight in her you are to let her go wherever she will you may not take a price for her as if she was your property for you have made use of her for your pleasure
 if a man has two wives one greatly loved and the other hated and the two of them have had children by him and if the first son is the child of the hated wife
 then when he gives his property to his sons for their heritage he is not to put the son of his loved one in the place of the first son the son of the hated wife
 but he is to give his first son his birthright and twice as great a part of his property for he is the first fruits of his strength and the right of the first son is his
 if a man has a son who is hard hearted and uncontrolled who gives no attention to the voice of his father and mother and will not be ruled by them though they give him punishment
 then let his father and mother take him to the responsible men of the town to the public place
 and say to them this son of ours is hard hearted and uncontrolled he will not give attention to us he gives himself up to pleasure and strong drink
 then he is to be stoned to death by all the men of the town so you are to put away the evil from among you and all israel hearing of it will be full of fear
 if a man does a crime for which the punishment is death and he is put to death by hanging him on a tree
 do not let his body be on the tree all night but put it to rest in the earth the same day for the man who undergoes hanging is cursed by god so do not make unclean the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage
 if you see your brothers ox or his sheep wandering do not go by without helping but take them back to your brother
 if their owner is not near or if you are not certain who he is then take the beast to your house and keep it till its owner comes in search of it and then you are to give it back to him
 do the same with his ass or his robe or anything which has gone from your brothers keeping and which you have come across do not keep it to yourself
 if you see your brothers ox or his ass falling down on the road do not go by without giving him help in lifting it up again
 it is not right for a woman to be dressed in mans clothing or for a man to put on a womans robe whoever does such things is disgusting to the lord your god
 if by chance you see a place which a bird has made for itself in a tree or on the earth with young ones or eggs and the mother bird seated on the young ones or on the eggs do not take the mother bird with the young
 see that you let the mother bird go but the young ones you may take so it will be well for you and your life will be long
 if you are building a house make a railing for the roof so that the blood of any man falling from it will not come on your house
 do not have your vine garden planted with two sorts of seed or all of it may become a loss the seed you have put in as well as the increase
 do not do your ploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together
 do not have clothing made of two sorts of thread wool and linen together
 on the four edges of your robe with which your body is covered put ornaments of twisted threads
 if any man takes a wife and having had connection with her has no delight in her
 and says evil things about her and gives her a bad name saying i took this woman and when i had connection with her it was clear to me that she was not a virgin
 then let the girls father and mother put before the responsible men of the town in the public place signs that the girl was a virgin
 and let the girls father say to the responsible men i gave my daughter to this man for his wife but he has no love for her
 and now he has put shame on her saying that she is not a virgin but here is the sign that she is a virgin then they are to put her clothing before the responsible men of the town
 then the responsible men of the town are to give the man his punishment
 they will take from him a hundred shekels of silver which are to be given to the father of the girl because he has given an evil name to a virgin of israel she will go on being his wife he may never put her away all his life
 but if what he has said is true and she is seen to be not a virgin
 then they are to make the girl come to the door of her fathers house and she will be stoned to death by the men of the town because she has done evil and put shame on israel by acting as a loose woman in her fathers house so you are to put away evil from among you
 if a man is taken in the act of going in to a married woman the two of them the man as well as the woman are to be put to death so you are to put away the evil from israel
 if a young virgin has given her word to be married to a man and another man meeting her in the town has connection with her
 then you are to take the two of them to the doorway of the town and have them stoned to death the young virgin because she gave no cry for help though it was in the town and the man because he has put shame on his neighbours wife so you are to put away evil from among you
 but if the man meeting such a virgin in the open country takes her by force then only the man is to be put to death
 nothing is to be done to the virgin because there is no cause of death in her it is the same as if a man made an attack on his neighbour and put him to death
 for he came across her in the open country and there was no one to come to the help of the virgin in answer to her cry
 if a man sees a young virgin who has not given her word to be married to anyone and he takes her by force and has connection with her and discovery is made of it
 then the man will have to give the virgins father fifty shekels of silver and make her his wife because he has put shame on her he may never put her away all his life
 a man may not take his fathers wife or have sex relations with a woman who is his fathers
 no man whose private parts have been wounded or cut off may come into the meeting of the lords people
 one whose father and mother are not married may not come into the meeting of the lords people or any of his family to the tenth generation
 no ammonite or moabite or any of their people to the tenth generation may come into the meeting of the lords people
 because they gave you no bread or water on your way when you came out of egypt and they got balaam the son of peor from pethor in aram naharaim to put curses on you
 but the lord your god would not give ear to balaam but let the curse be changed into a blessing to you because of his love for you
 do nothing for their peace or well being for ever
 but have no hate for an edomite because he is your brother or for an egyptian for you were living in his land
 their children in the third generation may come into the meeting of the lords people
 when you go out to war and put your tents in position keep from every evil thing
 if any man among you becomes unclean through anything which has taken place in the night he is to go out from the tent circle and keep outside it
 but when evening comes near let him take a bath and after sundown he may come back to the tents
 let there be a place outside the tent circle to which you may go
 and have among your arms a spade and when you have been to that place let that which comes from you be covered up with earth
 for the lord your god is walking among your tents to keep you safe and to give up into your hands those who are fighting against you then let your tents be holy so that he may see no unclean thing among you and be turned away from you
 do not give back to his master a servant who has gone in flight from his master and come to you
 let him go on living among you in whatever place is most pleasing to him do not be hard on him
 no daughter of israel is to let herself be used as a loose woman for a strange god and no son of israel is to give himself to a man
 do not take into the house of the lord your god as an offering for an oath the price of a loose woman or the money given to one used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods for these two things are disgusting to the lord your god
 do not take interest from an israelite on anything money or food or any other goods which you let him have
 from men of other nations you may take interest but not from an israelite so that the blessing of the lord your god may be on everything to which you put your hand in the land which you are about to take as your heritage
 when you take an oath to the lord do not be slow to give effect to it for without doubt the lord your god will make you responsible and will put it to your account as sin
 but if you take no oath there will be no sin
 whatever your lips have said see that you do it for you gave your word freely to the lord your god
 when you go into your neighbours vine garden you may take of his grapes at your pleasure but you may not take them away in your vessel
 when you go into your neighbours field you may take the heads of grain with your hand but you may not put your blade to his grain
 if a man takes a wife and after they are married she is unpleasing to him because of some bad quality in her let him give her a statement in writing and send her away from his house
 and when she has gone away from him she may become another mans wife
 and if the second husband has no love for her and giving her a statement in writing sends her away or if death comes to the second husband to whom she was married
 her first husband who had sent her away may not take her back after she has been wife to another for that is disgusting to the lord and you are not to be a cause of sin in the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage
 a newly married man will not have to go out with the army or undertake any business but may be free for one year living in his house for the comfort of his wife
 no one is to take on account of a debt the stones with which grain is crushed for in doing so he takes a mans living
 if a man takes by force one of his countrymen the children of israel using him as his property or getting a price for him that thief is to be put to death so you are to put away evil from among you
 in connection with the lepers disease take care to keep and do every detail of the teaching of the priests the levites as i gave them orders so you are to do
 keep in mind what the lord your god did to miriam on the way when you came out of egypt
 if you let your brother have the use of anything which is yours do not go into his house and take anything of his as a sign of his debt
 but keep outside till he comes out and gives it to you
 if he is a poor man do not keep his property all night
 but be certain to give it back to him when the sun goes down so that he may have his clothing for sleeping in and will give you his blessing and this will be put to your account as righteousness before the lord your god
 do not be hard on a servant who is poor and in need if he is one of your countrymen or a man from another nation living with you in your land
 give him his payment day by day not keeping it back over night for he is poor and his living is dependent on it and if his cry against you comes to the ears of the lord it will be judged as sin in you
 fathers are not to be put to death for their children or children for their fathers every man is to be put to death for the sin which he himself has done
 be upright in judging the cause of the man from a strange country and of him who has no father do not take a widows clothing on account of a debt
 but keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of egypt and the lord your god made you free for this is why i give you orders to do this
 when you get in the grain from your field if some of the grain has been dropped by chance in the field do not go back and get it but let it be for the man from a strange land the child without a father and the widow so that the blessing of the lord your god may be on all the work of your hands
 when you are shaking the fruit from your olive trees do not go over the branches a second time let some be for the man from a strange land the child without a father and the widow
 when you are pulling the grapes from your vines do not take up those which have been dropped let them be for the man from a strange land the child without a father and the widow
 keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of egypt for this is why i give you orders to do this
 if there is an argument between men and they go to law with one another let the judges give their decision for the upright and against the wrongdoer
 and if the wrongdoer is to undergo punishment by whipping the judge will give orders for him to go down on his face and be whipped before him the number of the blows being in relation to his crime
 he may be given forty blows not more for if more are given your brother may be shamed before you
 do not keep the ox from taking the grain when he is crushing it
 if brothers are living together and one of them at his death has no son the wife of the dead man is not to be married outside the family to another man let her husbands brother go in to her and make her his wife doing as it is right for a brother in law to do
 then the first male child she has will take the rights of the brother who is dead so that his name may not come to an end in israel
 but if the man says he will not take his brothers wife then let the wife go to the responsible men of the town and say my husbands brother will not keep his brothers name living in israel he will not do what it is right for a husbands brother to do
 then the responsible men of the town will send for the man and have talk with him and if he still says i will not take her
 then his brothers wife is to come to him before the responsible men of the town and take his shoe off his foot and put shame on him and say so let it be done to the man who will not take care of his brothers name
 and his family will be named in israel the house of him whose shoe has been taken off
 if two men are fighting and the wife of one of them coming to the help of her husband takes the other by the private parts
 her hand is to be cut off have no pity on her
 do not have in your bag different weights a great and a small
 or in your house different measures a great and a small
 but have a true weight and a true measure so that your life may be long in the land which the lord your god is giving you
 for all who do such things and all whose ways are not upright are disgusting to the lord your god
 keep in mind what amalek did to you on your way from egypt
 how meeting you on the way he made an attack on you when you were tired and without strength cutting off all the feeble ones at the end of your line and the fear of god was not in him
 so when the lord your god has given you rest from all who are against you on every side in the land which the lord your god is giving you for your heritage see to it that the memory of amalek is cut off from the earth keep this in mind
 now when you have come into the land which the lord is giving you for your heritage and you have made it yours and are living in it
 you are to take a part of the first fruits of the earth which you get from the land which the lord your god is giving you and put it in a basket and go to the place marked out by the lord your god as the resting place of his name
 and you are to come to him who is priest at that time and say to him i give witness today before the lord your god that i have come into the land which the lord made an oath to our fathers to give us
 then the priest will take the basket from your hand and put it down in front of the altar of the lord your god
 and these are the words which you will say before the lord your god my father was a wandering aramaean and he went down with a small number of people into egypt there he became a great and strong nation
 and the egyptians were cruel to us crushing us under a hard yoke
 and our cry went up to the lord the god of our fathers and the lords ear was open to the voice of our cry and his eyes took note of our grief and the crushing weight of our work
 and the lord took us out of egypt with a strong hand and a stretched out arm with works of power and signs and wonders
 and he has been our guide to this place and has given us this land a land flowing with milk and honey
 so now i have come here with the first of the fruits of the earth which you o lord have given me then you will put it down before the lord your god and give him worship
 and you will have joy in every good thing which the lord your god has given to you and to your family and the levite and the man from a strange land who is with you will take part in your joy
 when you have taken out a tenth from the tenth of all your produce in the third year which is the year when this has to be done give it to the levite and the man from a strange land and the child without a father and the widow so that they may have food in your towns and be full
 and say before the lord your god i have taken all the holy things out of my house and have given them to the levite and the man from a strange land and him who has no father and the widow as you have given me orders i have kept in mind all your orders in nothing have i gone against them
 no part of these things has been used for food in a time of weeping or put away when i was unclean or given for the dead i have given ear to the voice of the lord my god and have done all you have given me orders to do
 so looking down from your holy place in heaven send your blessing on your people israel and on the land which you have given us as you said in your oath to our fathers a land flowing with milk and honey
 today the lord your god gives you orders to keep all these laws and decisions so then keep and do them with all your heart and all your soul
 today you have given witness that the lord is your god and that you will go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions and give ear to his voice
 and the lord has made it clear this day that you are a special people to him as he gave you his word and that you are to keep all his orders
 and that he will make you high over all the nations he has made in praise in name and in honour and that you are to be a holy people to the lord your god as he has said
 then moses and the responsible men of israel gave the people these orders keep all the orders which i have given you this day
 and on the day when you go over jordan into the land which the lord your god is giving you put up great stones coating them with building paste
 and writing on them all the words of this law after you have gone over so that you may take the heritage which the lord your god is giving you a land flowing with milk and honey as the lord the god of your fathers has said
 and when you have gone over jordan you are to put up these stones as i have said to you today in mount ebal and have them coated with building paste
 there you are to make an altar to the lord your god of stones on which no iron instrument has been used
 you are to make the altar of the lord your god of uncut stones offering on it burned offerings to the lord your god
 and you are to make your peace offerings feasting there with joy before the lord your god
 and put on the stones all the words of this law writing them very clearly
 then moses and the priests the levites said to all israel be quiet and give ear o israel today you have become the people of the lord your god
 for this cause you are to give ear to the voice of the lord your god and do his orders and his laws which i give you this day
 that same day moses said to the people
 these are to take their places on mount gerizim for blessing the people when you have gone over jordan simeon and levi and judah and issachar and joseph and benjamin
 and these are to be on mount ebal for the curse reuben gad and asher and zebulun dan and naphtali
 then the levites are to say in a loud voice to all the men of israel
 cursed is the man who makes any image of wood or stone or metal disgusting to the lord the work of mans hands and puts it up in secret and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who does not give honour to his father or mother and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who takes his neighbours landmark from its place and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he by whom the blind are turned out of the way and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who gives a wrong decision in the cause of a man from a strange land or of one without a father or of a widow and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who has sex relations with his fathers wife for he has put shame on his father and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who has sex relations with any sort of beast and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who has sex relations with his sister the daughter of his father or of his mother and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who has sex relations with his mother in law and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who takes his neighbours life secretly and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who for a reward puts to death one who has done no wrong and let all the people say so be it
 cursed is he who does not take this law to heart to do it and let all the people say so be it
 now if you give ear to the voice of the lord your god and keep with care all these orders which i have given you today then the lord your god will put you high over all the nations of the earth
 and all these blessings will come on you and overtake you if your ears are open to the voice of the lord your god
 a blessing will be on you in the town and a blessing in the field
 a blessing will be on the fruit of your body and on the fruit of your land on the fruit of your cattle the increase of your herd and the young of your flock
 a blessing will be on your basket and on your bread basin
 a blessing will be on your coming in and on your going out
 by the power of the lord those who take arms against you will be overcome before you they will come out against you one way and will go in flight from you seven ways
 the lord will send his blessing on your store houses and on everything to which you put your hand his blessing will be on you in the land which the lord your god is giving you
 the lord will keep you as a people holy to himself as he has said to you in his oath if you keep the orders of the lord your god and go on walking in his ways
 and all the peoples of the earth will see that the name of the lord is on you and they will go in fear of you
 and the lord will make you fertile in every good thing in the fruit of your body and the fruit of your cattle and the fruit of your fields in the land which the lord by his oath to your fathers said he would give you
 opening his store house in heaven the lord will send rain on your land at the right time blessing all the work of your hands other nations will make use of your wealth and you will have no need of theirs
 the lord will make you the head and not the tail and you will ever have the highest place if you give ear to the orders of the lord your god which i give you today to keep and to do them
 not turning away from any of the orders which i give you today to the right hand or to the left or going after any other gods to give them worship
 but if you do not give ear to the voice of the lord your god and take care to do all his orders and his laws which i give you today then all these curses will come on you and overtake you
 you will be cursed in the town and cursed in the field
 a curse will be on your basket and on your bread basin
 a curse will be on the fruit of your body and on the fruit of your land on the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock
 you will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out
 the lord will send on you cursing and trouble and punishment in everything to which you put your hand till sudden destruction overtakes you because of your evil ways in which you have been false to me
 the lord will send disease after disease on you till you have been cut off by death from the land to which you are going
 the lord will send wasting disease and burning pain and flaming heat against you keeping back the rain till your land is waste and dead so will it be till your destruction is complete
 and the heaven over your heads will be brass and the earth under you hard as iron
 the lord will make the rain of your land powder and dust sending it down on you from heaven till your destruction is complete
 the lord will let you be overcome by your haters you will go out against them one way and you will go in flight before them seven ways you will be the cause of fear among all the kingdoms of the earth
 your bodies will be meat for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth there will be no one to send them away
 the lord will send on you the disease of egypt and other sorts of skin diseases which nothing will make well
 he will make your minds diseased and your eyes blind and your hearts wasted with fear
 you will go feeling your way when the sun is high like a blind man for whom all is dark and nothing will go well for you you will be crushed and made poor for ever and you will have no saviour
 you will take a wife but another man will have the use of her the house which your hands have made will never be your resting place you will make a vine garden and never take the fruit of it
 your ox will be put to death before your eyes but its flesh will not be your food your ass will be violently taken away before your face and will not be given back to you your sheep will be given to your haters and there will be no saviour for you
 your sons and your daughters will be given to another people and your eyes will be wasted away with looking and weeping for them all the day and you will have no power to do anything
 the fruit of your land and all the work of your hands will be food for a nation which is strange to you and to your fathers you will only be crushed down and kept under for ever
 so that the things which your eyes have to see will send you out of your minds
 the lord will send a skin disease attacking your knees and your legs bursting out from your feet to the top of your head so that nothing will make you well
 and you and the king whom you have put over you will the lord take away to a nation strange to you and to your fathers there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone
 and you will become a wonder and a name of shame among all the nations where the lord will take you
 you will take much seed out into the field and get little in for the locust will get it
 you will put in vines and take care of them but you will get no wine or grapes from them for they will be food for worms
 your land will be full of olive trees but there will be no oil for the comfort of your body for your olive tree will give no fruit
 you will have sons and daughters but they will not be yours for they will go away prisoners into a strange land
 all your trees and the fruit of your land will be the locusts
 the man from a strange land who is living among you will be lifted up higher and higher over you while you go down lower and lower
 he will let you have his wealth at interest and will have no need of yours he will be the head and you the tail
 and all these curses will come after you and overtake you till your destruction is complete because you did not give ear to the voice of the lord your god or keep his laws and his orders which he gave you
 these things will come on you and on your seed to be a sign and a wonder for ever
 because you did not give honour to the lord your god worshipping him gladly with joy in your hearts on account of all your wealth of good things
 for this cause you will become servants to those whom the lord your god will send against you without food and drink and clothing and in need of all things and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck till he has put an end to you
 the lord will send a nation against you from the farthest ends of the earth coming with the flight of an eagle a nation whose language is strange to you
 a hard faced nation who will have no respect for the old or mercy for the young
 he will take the fruit of your cattle and of your land till death puts an end to you he will let you have nothing of your grain or wine or oil or any of the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock till he has made your destruction complete
 your towns will be shut in by his armies till your high walls in which you put your faith have come down his armies will be round your towns through all your land which the lord your god has given you
 and your food will be the fruit of your body the flesh of the sons and daughters which the lord your god has given you because of your bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters
 that man among you who is soft and used to comfort will be hard and cruel to his brother and to his dear wife and to of those his children who are still living
 and will not give to any of them the flesh of his children which will be his food because he has no other in the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns
 the most soft and delicate of your women who would not so much as put her foot on the earth so delicate is she will be hard hearted to her husband and to her son and to her daughter
 and to her baby newly come to birth and to the children of her body for having no other food she will make a meal of them secretly because of her bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns
 if you will not take care to do all the words of this law recorded in this book honouring that name of glory and of fear the lord your god
 then the lord your god will make your punishment and the punishment of your seed a thing to be wondered at great punishments and cruel diseases stretching on through long years
 he will send on you again all the diseases of egypt which were a cause of fear to you and they will take you in their grip
 and all the diseases and the pains not recorded in the book of this law will the lord send on you till your destruction is complete
 and you will become a very small band though your numbers were like the stars of heaven because you did not give ear to the voice of the lord your god
 and as the lord took delight in doing you good and increasing you so the lord will take pleasure in cutting you off and causing your destruction and you will be uprooted from the land which you are about to take as your heritage
 and the lord will send you wandering among all peoples from one end of the earth to the other there you will be servants to other gods of wood and stone gods of which you and your fathers had no knowledge
 and even among these nations there will be no peace for you and no rest for your feet but the lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul
 your very life will be hanging in doubt before you and day and night will be dark with fears and nothing in life will be certain
 in the morning you will say if only it was evening  and at evening you will say if only morning would come  because of the fear in your hearts and the things which your eyes will see
 and the lord will take you back to egypt again in ships by the way of which i said to you you will never see it again there you will be offering yourselves as men servants and women servants to your haters for a price and no man will take you
 these are the words of the agreement which moses was ordered by the lord to make with the children of israel in the land of moab in addition to the agreement which he made with them in horeb
 and moses said in the hearing of all israel you have seen all the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land
 the great tests which your eyes saw and the signs and wonders
 but even to this day the lord has not given you a mind open to knowledge or seeing eyes or hearing ears
 for forty years i have been your guide through the waste land your clothing has not become old on your backs or your shoes on your feet
 you have had no bread or wine or strong drink so that you might see that i am the lord your god
 when you came to this place sihon king of heshbon and og king of bashan came out to make war against us and we overcame them
 and we took their land and gave it to the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh for their heritage
 so keep the words of this agreement and do them so that it may be well for you in everything you do
 you have come here today all of you before the lord your god the heads of your tribes the overseers and those who are in authority over you with all the men of israel
 and your little ones your wives and the men of other lands who are with you in your tents down to the wood cutter and the servant who gets water for you
 with the purpose of taking part in the agreement of the lord your god and his oath which he makes with you today
 and so that he may make you his people today and be your god as he has said to you and as he made an oath to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob
 and not with you only do i make this agreement and this oath
 but with everyone who is here with us today before the lord our god as well as with those who are not here
  for you have in mind how we were living in the land of egypt and how we came through all the nations which were on your way
 and you have seen their disgusting doings and the images of wood and stone and silver and gold which were among them 
 so that there may not be among you any man or woman or family or tribe whose heart is turned away from the lord our god today to go after other gods and give them worship or any root among you whose fruit is poison and bitter sorrow
 if such a man hearing the words of this oath takes comfort in the thought that he will have peace even if he goes on in the pride of his heart taking whatever chance may give him
 the lord will have no mercy on him but the wrath of the lord will be burning against that man and all the curses recorded in this book will be waiting for him and the lord will take away his name completely from the earth
 he will be marked out by the lord from all the tribes of israel for an evil fate in keeping with all the curses of the agreement recorded in this book of the law
 and future generations your children coming after you and travellers from far countries will say when they see the punishments of that land and the diseases which the lord has sent on it
 and that all the land is a salt and smoking waste not planted or giving fruit or clothed with grass but wasted like sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboiim on which the lord sent destruction in the heat of his wrath
 truly all the nations will say why has the lord done so to this land what is the reason for this great and burning wrath
 then men will say because they gave up the agreement of the lord the god of their fathers which he made with them when he took them out of the land of egypt
 and they went after other gods and gave them worship gods who were strange to them and whom he had not given them
 and so the wrath of the lord was moved against this land to send on it all the curse recorded in this book
 rooting them out of their land in the heat of his wrath and passion and driving them out into another land as at this day
 the secret things are the lord our gods but the things which have been made clear are ours and our childrens for ever so that we may do all the words of this law
 then turning we took the road to bashan and og king of bashan came out against us with all his people and made an attack on us at edrei
 and the lord said to me have no fear of him for i have given him and all his people and his land into your hands do to him as you did to sihon king of the amorites who was ruling in heshbon
 so the lord our god gave up og king of bashan and all his people into our hands and we overcame him so completely that all his people came to their end in the fight
 at that time we took all his towns there was not one town of the sixty towns all the country of argob the kingdom of og in bashan which we did not take
 all these towns had high walls round them with doors and locks and in addition we took a great number of unwalled towns
 and we put them to the curse every town together with men women and children
 but we took for ourselves all the cattle and the stored wealth of the towns
 at that time we took their land from the two kings of the amorites on the far side of jordan from the valley of the arnon to mount hermon
  by the sidonians hermon is named sirion and by the amorites shenir 
 all the towns of the table land and all gilead and bashan as far as salecah and edrei towns of the kingdom of og in bashan
  for og king of bashan was the last of all the rephaim his bed was made of iron is it not in rabbah in the land of the children of ammon it was nine cubits long and four cubits wide measured by the common cubit 
 and this land which we took at that time from aroer by the valley of the arnon and half the hill country of gilead with its towns i gave to the reubenites and the gadites
 the rest of gilead and all bashan the kingdom of og all the land of argob together with bashan i gave to the half tribe of manasseh  this land is named the land of the rephaim
 jair the son of manasseh took all the land of argob as far as the country of the geshurites and the maacathites naming it bashan havvoth jair after himself as it is to this day 
 and gilead i gave to machir
 and the land from gilead to the valley of the arnon with the middle of the valley as a limit as far as the river jabbok which is the limit of the country of the children of ammon i gave to the reubenites and the gadites
 as well as the arabah with the river jordan as their limit from chinnereth to the salt sea under the slopes of pisgah to the east
 at that time i gave you orders saying the lord has given you this land for your heritage all the men of war are to go over armed before your brothers the children of israel
 but your wives and your little ones and your cattle  for it is clear that you have much cattle  may go on living in the towns i have given you
 till the lord has given rest to your brothers as to you and till they have taken for themselves the land which the lord your god is giving them on the other side of jordan then you may go back every man of you to the heritage which i have given you
 and i gave orders to joshua at that time saying your eyes have seen what the lord your god has done to these two kings so will the lord do to all the kingdoms into which you come
 have no fear of them for the lord your god will be fighting for you
 and at that time i made request to the lord saying
 o lord god you have now for the first time let your servant see your great power and the strength of your hand for what god is there in heaven or on earth able to do such great works and such acts of power
 let me go over o lord and see the good land on the other side of jordan and that fair mountain country even lebanon
 but the lord was angry with me because of you and would not give ear to my prayer and the lord said to me let it be enough say no more about this thing
 go up to the top of pisgah and turning your eyes to the west and the north to the south and the east see the land with your eyes for you are not to go over jordan
 but give my orders to joshua comforting him and making him strong for he is to go over jordan at the head of this people and he will give them this land which you will see for their heritage
 so we were waiting in the valley facing beth peor
 now when all these things have come on you the blessing and the curse which i have put before you if the thought of them comes back to your minds when you are living among the nations where the lord your god has sent you
 and your hearts are turned again to the lord your god and you give ear to his word which i give you today you and your children with all your heart and with all your soul
 then the lord will have pity on you changing your fate and taking you back again from among all the nations where you have been forced to go
 even if those who have been forced out are living in the farthest part of heaven the lord your god will go in search of you and take you back
 placing you again in the land of your fathers as your heritage and he will do you good increasing you till you are more in number than your fathers were
 and the lord your god will give to you and to your seed a circumcision of the heart so that loving him with all your heart and all your soul you may have life
 and the lord your god will put all these curses on those who are against you and on your haters who put a cruel yoke on you
 and you will again give ear to the voice of the lord and do all his orders which i have given you today
 and the lord your god will make you fertile in all good things blessing the work of your hands and the fruit of your body and the fruit of your cattle and the fruit of your land for the lord will have joy in you as he had in your fathers
 if you give ear to the voice of the lord your god keeping his orders and his laws which are recorded in this book of the law and turning to the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul
 for these orders which i have given you today are not strange and secret and are not far away
 they are not in heaven for you to say who will go up to heaven for us and give us knowledge of them so that we may do them
 and they are not across the sea for you to say who will go over the sea for us and give us news of them so that we may do them
 but the word is very near you in your mouth and in your heart so that you may do it
 see i have put before you today life and good and death and evil
 in giving you orders today to have love for the lord your god to go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions so that you may have life and be increased and that the blessing of the lord your god may be with you in the land where you are going the land of your heritage
 but if your heart is turned away and your ear is shut and you go after those who would make you servants and worshippers of other gods
 i give witness against you this day that destruction will certainly be your fate and your days will be cut short in the land where you are going the land of your heritage on the other side of jordan
 let heaven and earth be my witnesses against you this day that i have put before you life and death a blessing and a curse so take life for yourselves and for your seed
 in loving the lord your god hearing his voice and being true to him for he is your life and by him will your days be long so that you may go on living in the land which the lord gave by an oath to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob
 so moses said all these things to israel
 then he said to them i am now a hundred and twenty years old i am no longer able to go out and come in and the lord has said to me you are not to go over jordan
 the lord your god he will go over before you he will send destruction on all those nations and you will take their land as your heritage and joshua will go over at your head as the lord has said
 the lord will do to them as he did to sihon and to og the kings of the amorites and to their land whom he put to destruction
 the lord will give them up into your hands and you are to do to them as i have given you orders
 be strong and take heart and have no fear of them for it is the lord your god who is going with you he will not take away his help from you
 then moses sent for joshua and before the eyes of all israel said to him be strong and take heart for you are to go with this people into the land which the lord by his oath to their fathers has given them by your help they will take it for their heritage
 it is the lord who goes before you he will be with you he will not take away his help from you or give you up so have no fear
 then moses put all this law in writing and gave it to the priests the sons of levi who take up the ark of the lords agreement and to all the responsible men of israel
 and moses said to them at the end of every seven years at the time fixed for the ending of debts at the feast of tents
 when all israel has come before the lord your god in the place named by him let a reading be given of this law in the hearing of all israel
 make all the people come together men and women and children and anyone from another country who is with you so that hearing they may become wise in the fear of the lord your god and take care to do all the words of this law
 and so that your children to whom it is new may give ear and be trained in the fear of the lord your god while you are living in the land which you are going over jordan to take for your heritage
 at that time the lord said to moses the day of your death is near send for joshua and come to the tent of meeting so that i may give him his orders so moses and joshua went to the tent of meeting
 and the lord was seen in the tent in a pillar of cloud resting by the door of the tent
 and the lord said to moses now you are going to rest with your fathers and this people will be false to me uniting themselves to the strange gods of the land where they are going they will be turned away from me and will not keep the agreement i have made with them
 in that day my wrath will be moved against them and i will be turned away from them veiling my face from them and destruction will overtake them and unnumbered evils and troubles will come on them so that in that day they will say have not these evils come on us because our god is not with us
 truly my face will be turned away from them in that day because of all the evil they have done in going after other gods
 make then this song for yourselves teaching it to the children of israel put it in their mouths so that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel
 for when i have taken them into the land named in my oath to their fathers a land flowing with milk and honey and they have made themselves full of food and are fat then they will be turned to other gods and will give them worship no longer honouring me or keeping my agreement
 then when evils and troubles without number have overtaken them this song will be a witness to them for the words of it will be clear in the memories of their children for i see the thoughts which are moving in their hearts even now before i have taken them into the land of my oath
 so that same day moses made this song teaching it to the children of israel
 then he gave orders to joshua the son of nun saying to him be strong and take heart for you are to go at the head of the children of israel into the land which i made an oath to give them and i will be with you
 now after writing all the words of this law in a book till the record of them was complete
 moses said to the levites who were responsible for taking up the ark of the lords agreement
 take this book of the law and put it by the ark of the lords agreement so that it may be a witness against you
 for i have knowledge of your hard and uncontrolled hearts even now while i am still living you will not be ruled by the lord how much less after my death
 get together before me all those who are in authority in your tribes and your overseers so that i may say these things in their hearing and make heaven and earth my witnesses against them
 for i am certain that after my death you will give yourselves up to sin wandering from the way which i have given you and evil will overtake you in the end because you will do evil in the eyes of the lord moving him to wrath by the work of your hands
 then in the hearing of all the meeting of israel moses said the words of this song to the end
 give ear o heavens to my voice let the earth take note of the words of my mouth
 my teaching is dropping like rain coming down like dew on the fields like rain on the young grass and showers on the garden plants
 for i will give honour to the name of the lord let our god be named great
 he is the rock complete is his work for all his ways are righteousness a god without evil who keeps faith true and upright is he
 they have become false they are not his children the mark of sin is on them they are an evil and hard hearted generation
 is this your answer to the lord o foolish people and unwise is he not your father who has given you life he has made you and given you your place
 keep in mind the days of the past give thought to the years of generations gone by go to your father and he will make it clear to you to the old men and they will give you the story
 when the most high gave the nations their heritage separating into groups the children of men he had the limits of the peoples marked out keeping in mind the number of the children of israel
 for the lords wealth is his people jacob is the land of his heritage
 he came to him in the waste land in the unpeopled waste of sand putting his arms round him and caring for him he kept him as the light of his eye
 as an eagle teaching her young to make their flight with her wings outstretched over them takes them up on her strong feathers
 so the lord only was his guide no other god was with him
 he put him on the high places of the earth his food was the increase of the field honey he gave him out of the rock and oil out of the hard rock
 butter from his cows and milk from his sheep with fat of lambs and sheep of bashan and goats and the heart of the grain and for your drink wine from the blood of the grape
 but jeshurun became fat and would not be controlled you have become fat you are thick and full of food then he was untrue to the god who made him giving no honour to the rock of his salvation
 the honour which was his they gave to strange gods by their disgusting ways he was moved to wrath
 they made offerings to evil spirits which were not god to gods who were strange to them which had newly come up not feared by your fathers
 you have no thought for the rock your father you have no memory of the god who gave you birth
 and the lord saw with disgust the evil doing of his sons and daughters
 and he said my face will be veiled from them i will see what their end will be for they are an uncontrolled generation children in whom is no faith
 they have given my honour to that which is not god moving me to wrath with their false worship i will give their honour to those who are not a people moving them to wrath by a foolish nation
 for my wrath is a flaming fire burning to the deep parts of the underworld burning up the earth with her increase and firing the deep roots of the mountains
 i will send a rain of troubles on them my arrows will be showered on them
 they will be wasted from need of food and overcome by burning heat and bitter destruction and the teeth of beasts i will send on them with the poison of the worms of the dust
 outside they will be cut off by the sword and in the inner rooms by fear death will take the young man and the virgin the baby at the breast and the grey haired man
 i said i would send them wandering far away i would make all memory of them go from the minds of men
 but for the fear that their haters uplifted in their pride might say our hand is strong the lord has not done all this
 for they are a nation without wisdom there is no sense in them
 if only they were wise if only this was clear to them and they would give thought to their future 
 how would it be possible for one to overcome a thousand and two to send ten thousand in flight if their rock had not let them go if the lord had not given them up
 for their rock is not like our rock even our haters themselves being judges
 for their vine is the vine of sodom from the fields of gomorrah their grapes are the grapes of evil and the berries are bitter
 their wine is the poison of dragons the cruel poison of snakes
 is not this among my secrets kept safe in my store house
 punishment is mine and reward at the time of the slipping of their feet for the day of their downfall is near sudden will be their fate
 for the lord will be judge of his people he will have pity for his servants when he sees that their power is gone there is no one shut up or free
 and he will say where are their gods the rock in which they put their faith
 who took the fat of their offerings and the wine of their drink offering let them now come to your help let them be your salvation
 see now i myself am he there is no other god but me giver of death and life wounding and making well and no one has power to make you free from my hand
 for lifting up my hand to heaven i say by my unending life
 if i make sharp my shining sword and my hand is outstretched for judging i will give punishment to those who are against me and their right reward to my haters
 i will make my arrows red with blood my sword will be feasting on flesh with the blood of the dead and the prisoners of the long haired heads of my haters
 be glad o you his people over the nations for he will take payment for the blood of his servants and will give punishment to his haters and take away the sin of his land for his people
 so moses said all the words of this song in the hearing of the people he and hoshea the son of nun
 and after saying all this to the people
 moses said to them let the words which i have said to you today go deep into your hearts and give orders to your children to do every word of this law
 and this is no small thing for you but it is your life and through this you may make your days long in the land which you are going over jordan to take for your heritage
 that same day the lord said to moses
 go up into this mountain of abarim to mount nebo in the land of moab opposite jericho there you may see the land of canaan which i am giving to the children of israel for their heritage
 and let death come to you on the mountain where you are going and be put to rest with your people as death came to aaron your brother on mount hor where he was put to rest with his people
 because of your sin against me before the children of israel at the waters of meribath kadesh in the waste land of zin because you did not keep my name holy among the children of israel
 so you will see the land before you but you will not go into the land which i am giving to the children of israel
 now this is the blessing which moses the man of god gave to the children of israel before his death
 he said the lord came from sinai dawning on them from seir shining out from mount paran coming from meribath kadesh from his right hand went flames of fire his wrath made waste the peoples
 all his holy ones are at his hand they go at his feet they are lifted up on his wings
 moses gave us a law a heritage for the people of jacob
 and there was a king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of israel came together
 let life not death be reubens let not the number of his men be small
 and this is the blessing of judah he said give ear o lord to the voice of judah and make him one with his people let your hands take up his cause and be his help against his attackers
 and of levi he said give your thummim to levi and let the urim be with your loved one whom you put to the test at massah with whom you were angry at the waters of meribah
 who said of his father who is he and of his mother i have not seen her he kept himself separate from his brothers and had no knowledge of his children for they have given ear to your word and kept your agreement
 they will be the teachers of your decisions to jacob and of your law to israel the burning of perfumes before you will be their right and the ordering of burned offerings on your altar
 let your blessing o lord be on his substance may the work of his hands be pleasing to you may those who take up arms against him and all who have hate for him be wounded through the heart never to be lifted up again
 and of benjamin he said benjamin is the loved one of the lord he will be kept safe at all times he will be covered by the most high resting between his arms
 and of joseph he said let the blessing of the lord be on his land for the good things of heaven on high and the deep waters flowing under the earth
 and the good things of the fruits of the sun and the good things of the growth of the moons
 and the chief things of the oldest mountains and the good things of the eternal hills
 the good things of the earth and all its wealth the good pleasure of him who was seen in the burning tree may they come on the head of joseph on the head of him who was prince among his brothers
 he is a young ox glory is his his horns are the horns of the mountain ox with which all peoples will be wounded even to the ends of the earth they are the ten thousands of ephraim and the thousands of manasseh
 and of zebulun he said be glad zebulun in your going out and issachar in your tents
 they will send out the word for the people to come to the mountain taking there the offerings of righteousness for the store of the seas will be theirs and the secret wealth of the sand
 of gad he said a blessing be on him who makes wide the limits of gad he takes his rest like a she lion taking for himself the arm and the crown of the head
 he kept for himself the first part for his was the rulers right he put in force the righteousness of the lord and his decisions for israel
 and of dan he said dan is a young lion springing out from bashan
 and of naphtali he said o naphtali made glad with grace and full of the blessing of the lord the sea and its fishes will be his
 and of asher he said let asher have the blessing of children may he be pleasing to his brothers and let his foot be wet with oil
 your shoes will be iron and brass and as your days so may your work be
 no other is like the god of jeshurun coming on the heavens to your help and letting his glory be seen in the skies
 the god of your fathers is your safe resting place and under you are his eternal arms driving out the forces of your haters from before you he said let destruction overtake them
 and israel is living in peace the fountain of jacob by himself in a land of grain and wine with dew dropping from the heavens
 happy are you o israel who is like you a people whose saviour is the lord whose help is your cover whose sword is your strength  all those who are against you will put themselves under your rule and your feet will be planted on their high places
 and moses went up from the table lands of moab to mount nebo to the top of pisgah which is facing jericho and the lord let him see all the land the land of gilead as far as dan
 and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah as far as the great sea of the west
 and the south and the circle of the valley of jericho the town of palm trees as far as zoar
 and the lord said to him this is the land about which i made an oath to abraham isaac and jacob saying i will give it to your seed now i have let you see it with your eyes but you will not go in there
 so death came to moses the servant of the lord there in the land of moab as the lord had said
 and the lord put him to rest in the valley in the land of moab opposite beth peor but no man has knowledge of his resting place to this day
 and moses at his death was a hundred and twenty years old his eye had not become clouded or his natural force become feeble
 for thirty days the children of israel were weeping for moses in the table lands of moab till the days of weeping and sorrow for moses were ended
 and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had put his hands on him and the children of israel gave ear to him and did as the lord had given orders to moses
 there has never been another prophet in israel like moses whom the lord had knowledge of face to face
 in all the signs and wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and all his land
 and in all the acts of power and fear which moses did before the eyes of all israel
 and now give ear o israel to the laws and the decisions which i am teaching you and do them so that life may be yours and you may go in and take for yourselves the land which the lord the god of your fathers is giving you
 make no addition to the orders which i give you and take nothing from them but keep the orders of the lord your god which i give you
 your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baal peor for destruction came from the lord on all those among you who went after baal peor
 but you who kept faith with the lord are living every one of you today
 i have been teaching you laws and decisions as i was ordered to do by the lord my god so that you might keep them in the land to which you are going to take it for your heritage
 so keep these laws and do them for so will your wisdom and good sense be clear in the eyes of the peoples who hearing all these laws will say truly this great nation is a wise and far seeing people
 for what great nation has a god so near to them as the lord our god is whenever we are turned to him in prayer
 and what great nation has laws and decisions so right as all this law which i put before you today
 only take care and keep watch on your soul for fear that the things which your eyes have seen go from your memory and from your heart all the days of your life but let the knowledge of them be given to your children and to your childrens children
 that day when you were waiting before the lord your god in horeb and the lord said to me make all the people come together so that hearing my words they may go in fear of me all the days of their life on earth and give this teaching to their children
 and you came near waiting at the foot of the mountain and flames of fire went up from the mountain to the heart of heaven with dark clouds and all was black as night
 and the voice of the lord came to you out of the fire the sound of his words came to your ears but you saw no form there was nothing but a voice
 and he gave you his agreement with you the ten rules which you were to keep which he put in writing on the two stones of the law
 and the lord gave me orders at that time to make clear to you these laws and decisions so that you might do them in the land to which you are going and which is to be your heritage
 so keep watch on yourselves with care for you saw no form of any sort on the day when the voice of the lord came to you in horeb out of the heart of the fire
 so that you may not be turned to evil ways and make for yourselves an image in the form of any living thing male or female
 or any beast of the earth or winged bird of the air
 or of anything which goes flat on the earth or any fish in the water under the earth
 and when your eyes are lifted up to heaven and you see the sun and the moon and the stars all the army of heaven do not let yourselves be moved to give them worship or become the servants of what the lord has given equally to all peoples under heaven
 but the lord has taken you out of the flaming fire out of egypt to be to him the people of his heritage as you are today
 and the lord was angry with me because of you and made an oath that i was not to go over jordan into the good land which the lord is giving you for your heritage
 but death is to come to me in this land i may not go over jordan but you will go over and take that good land for your heritage
 take care that you do not let the agreement of the lord your god which he has made with you go out of your mind or make for yourselves images of any sort against the orders which the lord your god has given you
 for the lord your god is an all burning fire and he will not let the honour which is his be given to any other
 if when you have had children and childrens children and have been living a long time in the land you are turned to evil ways and make an image of any sort and do evil in the eyes of the lord your god moving him to wrath
 may heaven and earth be my witnesses against you today that destruction will quickly overtake you cutting you off from that land which you are going over jordan to take your days will not be long in that land but you will come to a complete end
 and the lord will send you wandering among the peoples only a small band of you will be kept from death among the nations where the lord will send you
 there you will be the servants of gods made by mens hands of wood and stone having no power of seeing or hearing or taking food or smelling
 but if in those lands you are turned again to the lord your god searching for him with all your heart and soul he will not keep himself from you
 when you are in trouble and all these things have come on you if in the future you are turned again to the lord your god and give ear to his voice
 because the lord your god is a god of mercy he will not take away his help from you or let destruction overtake you or be false to the agreement which he made by an oath with your fathers
 give thought now to the days which are past before your time from the day when god first gave life to man on the earth and searching from one end of heaven to the other see if such a great thing as this has ever been or if anything like it has been talked of in story
 has any people ever gone on living after hearing the voice of god out of the heart of the fire as you did
 has god ever before taken a nation for himself from out of another nation by punishments and signs and wonders by war and by a strong hand and a stretched out arm and great acts of wonder and fear as the lord your god did for you in egypt before your very eyes
 all this he let you see so that you might be certain that the lord is god and there is no other
 out of heaven itself his voice came to you teaching you and on earth he let you see his great fire and his words came to your ears out of the heart of the fire
 and because of his love for your fathers he took their seed and made it his and he himself present among you took you out of egypt by his great power
 driving out before you nations greater and stronger than you to take you into their land and give it to you for your heritage as at this day
 so today be certain and keep the knowledge deep in your hearts that the lord is god in heaven on high and here on earth there is no other god
 then keep his laws and his orders which i give you today so that it may be well for you and for your children after you and that your lives may be long in the land which the lord your god is giving you for ever
 then moses had three towns marked out on the far side of jordan looking to the east
 to which anyone causing the death of his neighbour in error and not through hate might go in flight so that in one of these towns he might be kept from death
 the names of the towns were bezer in the waste land in the table land for the reubenites and ramoth in gilead for the gadites and golan in bashan for manasseh
 this is the law which moses put before the children of israel
 these are the rules and the laws and the decisions which moses gave to the children of israel after they came out of egypt
 on the far side of jordan in the valley facing beth peor in the land of sihon king of the amorites who was ruling in heshbon whom moses and the children of israel overcame after they had come out of egypt
 and they took his land for a heritage and the land of og king of bashan the two kings of the amorites whose lands were on the other side of jordan to the east
 from aroer on the edge of the valley of the arnon as far as mount sion which is hermon
 and all the arabah on the far side of jordan to the east as far as the sea of the arabah under the slopes of pisgah
 and moses sent for all israel and said to them give ear o israel to the laws and the decisions which i give you today and give attention to them so that you may keep and do them
 the lord our god made an agreement with us in horeb
 the lord did not make this agreement with our fathers but with us who are all living and present here today
 the word of the lord came to you face to face on the mountain out of the heart of the fire
  i was between the lord and you at that time to make clear to you the word of the lord because through fear of the fire you did not go up the mountain  saying
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 you are to have no other gods but me
 you may not make for yourselves an image in the form of anything in heaven or on earth or in the waters under the earth
 you may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship for i the lord your god am a god who will not give his honour to another and i will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers to the third and fourth generation of my haters
 and i will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws
 you are not to make use of the name of the lord your god for an evil purpose whoever takes the lords name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged as a sinner by the lord
 keep the sabbath day as a holy day as you have been ordered by the lord your god
 on six days do all your work
 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on that day do no work you or your son or your daughter or your man servant or your woman servant or your ox or your ass or any of your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you so that your man servant and your woman servant may have rest as well as you
 and keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord your god took you out of that land by his strong hand and his stretched out arm for this reason the lord has given you orders to keep the sabbath day
 give honour to your father and your mother as you have been ordered by the lord your god so that your life may be long and all may be well for you in the land which the lord your god is giving you
 do not put anyone to death without cause
 do not be false to the married relation
 do not take the property of another
 do not give false witness against your neighbour
 or let your desire be turned to your neighbours wife or his house or his field or his man servant or his woman servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is your neighbours
 these words the lord said to all of you together on the mountain out of the heart of the fire out of the cloud and the dark with a great voice and he said no more he put them in writing on the two stones of the law and gave them to me
 and after hearing the voice which came out of the dark while the mountain was burning with fire all the heads of your tribes and your chiefs came to me
 and said the lord has let us see his glory and his power and his voice has come to us out of the fire today we have seen that a man may go on living even after hearing the voice of god
 why then is death to be our fate for if the voice of the lord our god comes to us any more death will overtake us and we will be burned up in this great fire
 for what man is there in all the earth who hearing the voice of the living god as we have out of the heart of the fire has been kept from death
 do you go near and after hearing everything which the lord our god has to say give us an account of all he has said to you and we will give ear and do it
 then the lord hearing your words to me said to me the words which this people have said to you have come to my ears what they have said is well said
 if only they had such a heart in them at all times so that they might go in fear of me and keep my orders and that it might be well for them and for their children for ever 
 now say to them go back to your tents
 but as for you keep your place here by me and i will give you all the orders and the laws and the decisions which you are to make clear to them so that they may do them in the land which i am giving them for their heritage
 take care then to do whatever the lord your god has given you orders to do let there be no turning away to the right hand or to the left
 go on walking in the way ordered for you by the lord your god so that life may be yours and it may be well for you and your days may be long in the land of your heritage
 now these are the orders and the laws and the decisions which the lord your god gave me for your teaching so that you might do them in the land of your heritage to which you are going
 so that living in the fear of the lord your god you may keep all his laws and his orders which i give you you and your son and your sons son all the days of your life and so that your life may be long
 so give ear o israel and take care to do this so that it may be well for you and you may be greatly increased as the lord the god of your fathers has given you his word in a land flowing with milk and honey
 give ear o israel the lord our god is one lord
 and the lord your god is to be loved with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength
 keep these words which i say to you this day deep in your hearts
 teaching them to your children with all care talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way when you go to sleep and when you get up
 let them be fixed as a sign on your hand and marked on your brow
 have them lettered on the pillars of your houses and over the doors of your towns
 and when the lord your god has taken you into the land which he gave his oath to your fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob that he would give you with great and fair towns which were not of your building
 and houses full of good things not stored up by you and places for storing water which you did not make and vine gardens and olive trees not of your planting and you have taken food and are full
 then take care that you keep your hearts true to the lord who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 let the fear of the lord your god be in your hearts and be his servants taking your oaths by his name
 do not go after other gods the gods of the peoples round about you
 for the lord your god who is with you is a god who will not let his honour be given to another or the wrath of the lord will be burning against you causing your destruction from the face of the earth
 do not put the lord your god to the test as you did in massah
 keep with care the orders of the lord your god and his rules and his laws which he has given you
 and do what is upright and good in the eyes of the lord your god so that it may be well for you and you may go in and take for your heritage that good land from which the lord undertook by an oath to your fathers
 to send out from before you all those who are against you
 and when your son says to you in time to come what is the reason for these rules and laws and decisions which the lord our god has given you
 then you will say to your son we were servants under pharaohs yoke in egypt and the lord took us out of egypt with a strong hand
 and the lord did great signs and wonders against egypt and against pharaoh and all his house before our eyes
 and he took us out from that place guiding us here to give us this land as he said in his oath to our fathers
 and the lord gave us orders to keep all these laws in the fear of the lord our god so that it might be well for us for ever and that he might keep us from death as he has done to this day
 and it will be our righteousness if we take care to keep all this order before the lord our god as he has given it to us
 when the lord your god takes you into the land where you are going which is to be your heritage and has sent out the nations before you the hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations greater and stronger than you
 and when the lord has given them up into your hands and you have overcome them give them up to complete destruction make no agreement with them and have no mercy on them
 do not take wives or husbands from among them do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons
 for through them your sons will be turned from me to the worship of other gods and the lord will be moved to wrath against you and send destruction on you quickly
 but this is what you are to do to them their altars are to be pulled down and their pillars broken and their holy trees cut down and their images burned with fire
 for you are a holy people to the lord your god marked out by the lord your god to be his special people out of all the nations on the face of the earth
 the lord did not give you his love or take you for himself because you were more in number than any other people for you were the smallest of the nations
 but because of his love for you and in order to keep his oath to your fathers the lord took you out with the strength of his hand making you free from the prison house and from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
 be certain then that the lord your god is god whose faith and mercy are unchanging who keeps his word through a thousand generations to those who have love for him and keep his laws
 rewarding his haters to their face with destruction he will have no mercy on his hater but will give him open punishment
 so keep the orders and the laws and the decisions which i give you today and do them
 and it will be that if you give attention to these decisions and keep and do them then the lord will keep his agreement with you and his mercy as he said in his oath to your fathers
 and he will give you his love blessing you and increasing you he will send his blessing on the offspring of your body and the fruit of your land your grain and your wine and your oil the increase of your cattle and the young of your flock in the land which by his oath to your fathers he undertook to give you
 you will have greater blessings than any other people no male or female among you or among your cattle will be without offspring
 and the lord will take away from you all disease and will not put on you any of the evil diseases of egypt which you have seen but will put them on your haters
 and you are to send destruction on all the peoples which the lord your god gives into your hands have no pity on them and do not give worship to their gods for that will be a cause of sin to you
 if you say in your hearts these nations are greater in number than we are how are we to take their land from them
 have no fear of them but keep well in mind what the lord your god did to pharaoh and to all egypt
 the great punishments which your eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the strong hand and the stretched out arm by which the lord your god took you out so will the lord your god do to all the peoples who are the cause of your fears
 and the lord will send a hornet among them till all the rest who have kept themselves safe from you in secret places have been cut off
 have no fear of them for the lord your god is with you a great god greatly to be feared
 the lord your god will send out the nations before you little by little they are not to be rooted out quickly for fear that the beasts of the field may be increased overmuch against you
 but the lord your god will give them up into your hands overpowering them till their destruction is complete
 he will give their kings into your hands and you will put their names out of existence under heaven there is not one of them who will not give way before you till their destruction is complete
 the images of their gods are to be burned with fire have no desire for the gold and silver on them and do not take it for yourselves for it will be a danger to you it is a thing disgusting to the lord your god
 and you may not take a disgusting thing into your house and so become cursed with its curse but keep yourselves from it turning from it with fear and hate for it is a cursed thing
 take care to keep all the orders which i give you today so that you may have life and be increased and go in and take as a heritage the land which the lord by his oath to your fathers undertook to give you
 and keep in mind the way by which the lord your god has taken you through the waste land these forty years so that he might make low your pride and put you to the test to see what was in your heart and if you would keep his orders or not
 and he made low your pride and let you be without food and gave you manna for your food a thing new to you which your fathers never saw so that he might make it clear to you that bread is not mans only need but his life is in every word which comes out of the mouth of the lord
 through all these forty years your clothing did not get old or your feet become tired
 keep in mind this thought that as a son is trained by his father so you have been trained by the lord your god
 then keep the orders of the lord your god fearing him and walking in his ways
 for the lord your god is guiding you into a good land a land of water springs of fountains and deep streams flowing out from the valleys and the hills
 a land of grain and vines and fig trees and fair fruits a land of oil giving olive trees and honey
 where there will be bread for you in full measure and you will be in need of nothing a land where the very stones are iron and from whose hills you may get copper
 and you will have food enough and be full praising the lord your god for the good land he has given you
 then take care that you are not turned away from the lord your god and from keeping his orders and decisions and laws which i give you this day
 and when you have taken food and are full and have made fair houses for yourselves and are living in them
 and when your herds and your flocks are increased and your stores of silver and gold and you have wealth of every sort
 take care that your hearts are not lifted up in pride giving no thought to the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 who was your guide through that great and cruel waste where there were poison snakes and scorpions and a dry land without water who made water come out of the hard rock for you
 who gave you manna for your food in the waste land a food which your fathers had never seen so that your pride might be broken and your hearts tested for your good in the end
 say not then in your hearts my power and the strength of my hands have got me this wealth
 but keep in mind the lord your god for it is he who gives you the power to get wealth so that he may give effect to the agreement which he made by his oath with your fathers as at this day
 and it is certain that if at any time you are turned away from the lord your god and go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship destruction will overtake you
 like the nations which the lord is cutting off before you so you will be cut off because you would not give ear to the voice of the lord your god
 give ear o israel today you are to go over jordan to take the heritage of nations greater and stronger than yourselves and towns of great size with walls as high as heaven
 a people great and tall the sons of the anakim of whom you have knowledge and of whom it has been said all are forced to give way before the sons of anak
 be certain then today that it is the lord your god who goes over before you like an all burning fire he will send destruction on them crushing them before you and you will send them in flight putting an end to them quickly as the lord has said
 and after the lord has sent them in flight from before you say not in your heart because of my righteousness the lord has given me this land when it is because of their evil doing that the lord is driving these nations out before you
 not for your righteousness or because your hearts are upright are you going in to take their land but because of the evil doing of these nations the lord your god is driving them out from before you and to give effect to his oath to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob
 be certain then that the lord your god is not giving you this good land as a reward for your righteousness for you are a stiff necked people
 keep well in mind how you made the lord your god angry in the waste land from the day when you went out of egypt till you came to this place you have gone against the orders of the lord
 again in horeb you made the lord angry and in his wrath he would have put an end to you
 when i had gone up into the mountain to be given the stones on which was recorded the agreement which the lord made with you i was on the mountain for forty days and forty nights without taking food or drinking water
 and the lord gave me the two stones with writing on them done by the finger of god on them were recorded all the words which the lord said to you on the mountain out of the heart of the fire on the day of the great meeting
 then at the end of forty days and forty nights the lord gave me those stones the stones of the agreement
 and the lord said to me get up now and go down quickly from this place for the people you have taken out of egypt have given themselves over to evil they have quickly been turned from the way in which i gave them orders to go they have made themselves a metal image
 and then the lord said to me i have seen that this people is stiff necked
 let me send destruction on them till their very name is cut off and i will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they
 so turning round i came down from the mountain and the mountain was burning with fire and the two stones of the agreement were in my hands
 and i saw that you had done evil against the lord and had made for yourselves a metal image of a young ox you had quickly been turned from the way in which the lord had given you orders to go
 and i let the stones go from my hands and they were broken before your eyes
 and i went down on my face before the lord as at the first for forty days and forty nights without taking food or drinking water because of all your sin in doing evil in the eyes of the lord and moving him to wrath
 for i was full of fear because of the wrath of the lord which was burning against you with your destruction in view but again the lords ear was open to my prayer
 and the lord in his wrath would have put aaron to death and i made prayer for aaron at the same time
 and i took your sin the image which you had made and put it in the fire and had it hammered and crushed very small till it was only dust and the dust i put in the stream flowing down from the mountain
 again at taberah and at massah and at kibroth hattaavah you made the lord angry
 and when the lord sent you from kadesh barnea saying go up and take the land which i have given you you went against the orders of the lord your god and had no faith in him and would not give ear to his voice
 from the day when i first had knowledge of you you have gone against the word of the lord
 so i went down on my face in prayer before the lord for forty days and forty nights as i did at first because the lord had said that he would put an end to you
 and i made prayer to the lord and said o lord god do not send destruction on your people and your heritage to whom by your great power you have given salvation whom you have taken out of egypt by the strength of your hand
 keep in mind your servants abraham isaac and jacob not looking at the hard heart of this people or their evil doing and their sin
 or it may be said in the land from which you have taken them because the lord was not able to take them into the land which he said he would give them and because of his hate for them he has taken them out to put them to death in the waste land
 but still they are your people and your heritage whom you took out by your great power and by your stretched out arm
 the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem
 all is to no purpose said the preacher all the ways of man are to no purpose
 what is a man profited by all his work which he does under the sun
 one generation goes and another comes but the earth is for ever
 the sun comes up and the sun goes down and goes quickly back to the place where he came up
 the wind goes to the south turning back again to the north circling round for ever
 all the rivers go down to the sea but the sea is not full to the place where the rivers go there they go again
 all things are full of weariness man may not give their story the eye has never enough of its seeing or the ear of its hearing
 that which has been is that which is to be and that which has been done is that which will be done and there is no new thing under the sun
 is there anything of which men say see this is new it has been in the old time which was before us
 there is no memory of those who have gone before and of those who come after there will be no memory for those who are still to come after them
 i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem
 and i gave my heart to searching out in wisdom all things which are done under heaven it is a hard thing which god has put on the sons of men to do
 i have seen all the works which are done under the sun all is to no purpose and desire for wind
 that which is bent may not be made straight and that which is not there may not be numbered
 i said to my heart see i have become great and am increased in wisdom more than any who were before me in jerusalem  yes my heart has seen much wisdom and knowledge
 and i gave my heart to getting knowledge of wisdom and of the ways of the foolish and i saw that this again was desire for wind
 because in much wisdom is much grief and increase of knowledge is increase of sorrow
 dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give out an evil smell more valued is a little wisdom than the great glory of the foolish
 the heart of the wise man goes in the right direction but the heart of a foolish man in the wrong
 and when the foolish man is walking in the way he has no sense and lets everyone see that he is foolish
 if the wrath of the ruler is against you keep in your place in him who keeps quiet even great sins may be overlooked
 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun like an error which comes by chance from a ruler
 the foolish are placed in high positions but men of wealth are kept low
 i have seen servants on horses and rulers walking on the earth as servants
 he who makes a hole for others will himself go into it and for him who makes a hole through a wall the bite of a snake will be a punishment
 he who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them and in the cutting of wood there is danger
 if the iron has no edge and he does not make it sharp then he has to put out more strength but wisdom makes things go well
 if a snake gives a bite before the word of power is said then there is no longer any use in the word of power
 the words of a wise mans mouth are sweet to all but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction
 the first words of his mouth are foolish and the end of his talk is evil crime
 the foolish are full of words man has no knowledge of what will be and who is able to say what will be after him
 the work of the foolish will be a weariness to him because he has no knowledge of the way to the town
 unhappy is the land whose king is a boy and whose rulers are feasting in the morning
 happy is the land whose ruler is of noble birth and whose chiefs take food at the right time for strength and not for feasting
 when no work is done the roof goes in and when the hands do nothing water comes into the house
 a feast is for laughing and wine makes glad the heart but by the one and the other money is wasted
 say not a curse against the king even in your thoughts and even secretly say not a curse against the man of wealth because a bird of the air will take the voice and that which has wings will give news of it
 put out your bread on the face of the waters for after a long time it will come back to you again
 give a part to seven or even to eight because you have no knowledge of the evil which will be on the earth
 if the clouds are full of rain they send it down on the earth and if a tree comes down to the south or the north in whatever place it comes down there it will be
 he who is watching the wind will not get the seed planted and he who is looking at the clouds will not get in the grain
 as you have no knowledge of the way of the wind or of the growth of the bones in the body of her who is with child even so you have no knowledge of the works of god who has made all
 in the morning put your seed into the earth and till the evening let not your hand be at rest because you are not certain which will do well this or that  or if the two will be equally good
 truly the light is sweet and it is good for the eyes to see the sun
 but even if a mans life is long and he has joy in all his years let him keep in mind the dark days because they will be great in number whatever may come is to no purpose
 have joy o young man while you are young and let your heart be glad in the days of your strength and go in the ways of your heart and in the desire of your eyes but be certain that for all these things god will be your judge
 so put away trouble from your heart and sorrow from your flesh because the early years and the best years are to no purpose
 let your mind be turned to your maker in the days of your strength while the evil days come not and the years are far away when you will say i have no pleasure in them
 while the sun or the light or the moon or the stars are not dark and the clouds come not back after the rain
 in the day when the keepers of the house are shaking for fear and the strong men are bent down and the women who were crushing the grain are at rest because their number is small and those looking out of the windows are unable to see
 when the doors are shut in the street and the sound of the crushing is low and the voice of the bird is soft and the daughters of music will be made low
 and he is in fear of that which is high and danger is in the road and the tree is white with flower and the least thing is a weight and desire is at an end because man goes to his last resting place and those who are sorrowing are in the streets
 before ever the silver cord is cut or the vessel of gold is broken or the pot is broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the water hole
 and the dust goes back to the earth as it was and the spirit goes back to god who gave it
 all things are to no purpose says the preacher all is to no purpose
 and because the preacher was wise he still gave the people knowledge searching out testing and putting in order a great number of wise sayings
 the preacher made search for words which were pleasing but his writing was in words upright and true
 the words of the wise are pointed and sayings grouped together are like nails fixed with a hammer they are given by one guide
 and further my son take note of this of the making of books there is no end and much learning is a weariness to the flesh
 this is the last word all has been said have fear of god and keep his laws because this is right for every man
 god will be judge of every work with every secret thing good or evil
 i said in my heart i will give you joy for a test so take your pleasure  but it was to no purpose
 of laughing i said it is foolish and of joy  what use is it
 i made a search with my heart to give pleasure to my flesh with wine still guiding my heart with wisdom and to go after foolish things so that i might see what was good for the sons of men to do under the heavens all the days of their life
 i undertook great works building myself houses and planting vine gardens
 i made myself gardens and fruit gardens planting in them fruit trees of all sorts
 i made pools to give water for the woods with their young trees
 i got men servants and women servants and they gave birth to sons and daughters in my house i had great wealth of herds and flocks more than all who were in jerusalem before me
 i got together silver and gold and the wealth of kings and of countries i got makers of song male and female and the delights of the sons of men  girls of all sorts to be my brides
 and i became great increasing more than all who had been before me in jerusalem and my wisdom was still with me
 and nothing which was desired by my eyes did i keep from them i did not keep any joy from my heart because my heart took pleasure in all my work and this was my reward
 then i saw all the works which my hands had made and everything i had been working to do and i saw that all was to no purpose and desire for wind and there was no profit under the sun
 and i went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways what may the man do who comes after the king the thing which he has done before
 then i saw that wisdom is better than foolish ways  as the light is better than the dark
 the wise mans eyes are in his head but the foolish man goes walking in the dark but still i saw that the same event comes to them all
 then said i in my heart as it comes to the foolish man so will it come to me so why have i been wise overmuch then i said in my heart this again is to no purpose
 of the wise man as of the foolish man there is no memory for ever seeing that those who now are will have gone from memory in the days to come see how death comes to the wise as to the foolish 
 so i was hating life because everything under the sun was evil to me all is to no purpose and desire for wind
 hate had i for all my work which i had done because the man who comes after me will have its fruits
 and who is to say if that man will be wise or foolish but he will have power over all my work which i have done and in which i have been wise under the sun this again is to no purpose
 so my mind was turned to grief for all the trouble i had taken and all my wisdom under the sun
 because there is a man whose work has been done with wisdom with knowledge and with an expert hand but one who has done nothing for it will have it for his heritage this again is to no purpose and a great evil
 what does a man get for all his work and for the weight of care with which he has done his work under the sun
 all his days are sorrow and his work is full of grief even in the night his heart has no rest this again is to no purpose
 there is nothing better for a man than taking meat and drink and having delight in his work this again i saw was from the hand of god
 who may take food or have pleasure without him
 to the man with whom he is pleased god gives wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he gives the work of getting goods together and storing up wealth to give to him in whom god has pleasure this again is to no purpose and desire for wind
 for everything there is a fixed time and a time for every business under the sun
 a time for birth and a time for death a time for planting and a time for uprooting
 a time to put to death and a time to make well a time for pulling down and a time for building up
 a time for weeping and a time for laughing a time for sorrow and a time for dancing
 a time to take stones away and a time to get stones together a time for kissing and a time to keep from kissing
 a time for search and a time for loss a time to keep and a time to give away
 a time for undoing and a time for stitching a time for keeping quiet and a time for talk
 a time for love and a time for hate a time for war and a time for peace
 what profit has the worker in the work which he does
 i saw the work which god has put on the sons of man
 he has made everything right in its time but he has made their hearts without knowledge so that man is unable to see the works of god from the first to the last
 i am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to be glad and to do good while life is in him
 and for every man to take food and drink and have joy in all his work is a reward from god
 i am certain that whatever god does will be for ever no addition may be made to it nothing may be taken from it and god has done it so that man may be in fear before him
 whatever is has been before and what is to be is now because god makes search for the things which are past
 and again i saw under the sun in the place of the judges that evil was there and in the place of righteousness that evil was there
 i said in my heart god will be judge of the good and of the bad because a time for every purpose and for every work has been fixed by him
 i said in my heart it is because of the sons of men so that god may put them to the test and that they may see themselves as beasts
 because the fate of the sons of men and the fate of the beasts is the same as is the death of one so is the death of the other and all have one spirit man is not higher than the beasts because all is to no purpose
 all go to one place all are of the dust and all will be turned to dust again
 who is certain that the spirit of the sons of men goes up to heaven or that the spirit of the beasts goes down to the earth
 so i saw that there is nothing better than for a man to have joy in his work  because that is his reward who will make him see what will come after him
 and again i saw all the cruel things which are done under the sun there was the weeping of those who have evil done to them and they had no comforter and from the hands of the evil doers there went out power but they had no comforter
 so my praise was for the dead who have gone to their death more than for the living who still have life
 yes happier than the dead or the living seemed he who has not ever been who has not seen the evil which is done under the sun
 and i saw that the cause of all the work and of everything which is done well was mans envy of his neighbour this again is to no purpose and a desire for wind
 the foolish man folding his hands takes the flesh of his body for food
 one hand full of rest is better than two hands full of trouble and desire for wind
 then i came back and i saw an example of what is to no purpose under the sun
 it is one who is by himself without a second and without son or brother but there is no end to all his work and he has never enough of wealth for whom then am i working and keeping myself from pleasure this again is to no purpose and a bitter work
 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their work
 and if one has a fall the other will give him a hand but unhappy is the man who is by himself because he has no helper
 so again if two are sleeping together they are warm but how may one be warm by himself
 and two attacked by one would be safe and three cords twisted together are not quickly broken
 a young man who is poor and wise is better than a king who is old and foolish and will not be guided by the wisdom of others
 because out of a prison the young man comes to be king though by birth he was only a poor man in the kingdom
 i saw all the living under the sun round the young man who was to be ruler in place of the king
 there was no end of all the people of all those whose head he was but they who come later will have no delight in him this again is to no purpose and desire for wind
 put your feet down with care when you go to the house of god for it is better to give ear than to make the burned offerings of the foolish whose knowledge is only of doing evil
 be not unwise with your mouth and let not your heart be quick to say anything before god because god is in heaven and you are on the earth  so let not the number of your words be great
 as a dream comes from much business so the voice of a foolish man comes with words in great number
 when you take an oath before god put it quickly into effect because he has no pleasure in the foolish keep the oath you have taken
 it is better not to take an oath than to take an oath and not keep it
 let not your mouth make your flesh do evil and say not before the angel it was an error so that god may not be angry with your words and put an end to the work of your hands
 because much talk comes from dreams and things of no purpose but let the fear of god be in you
 if you see the poor under a cruel yoke and law and right being violently overturned in a country be not surprised because one authority is keeping watch on another and there are higher than they
 it is good generally for a country where the land is worked to have a king
 he who has a love for silver never has enough silver or he who has love for wealth enough profit this again is to no purpose
 when goods are increased the number of those who take of them is increased and what profit has the owner but to see them
 the sleep of a working man is sweet if he has little food or much but to him who is full sleep will not come
 there is a great evil which i have seen under the sun  wealth kept by the owner to be his downfall
 and i saw the destruction of his wealth by an evil chance and when he became the father of a son he had nothing in his hand
 as he came from his mother at birth so does he go again he gets from his work no reward which he may take away in his hand
 and this again is a great evil that in all points as he came so will he go and what profit has he in working for the wind
 all his days are in the dark and he has much sorrow pain disease and trouble
 this is what i have seen it is good and fair for a man to take meat and drink and to have joy in all his work under the sun all the days of his life which god has given him that is his reward
 every man to whom god has given money and wealth and the power to have pleasure in it and to do his part and have joy in his work this is given by god
 he will not give much thought to the days of his life because god lets him be taken up with the joy of his heart
 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is hard on men
 a man to whom god gives money wealth and honour so that he has all his desires but god does not give him the power to have joy of it and a strange man takes it this is to no purpose and an evil disease
 if a man has a hundred children and his life is long so that the days of his years are great in number but his soul takes no pleasure in good and he is not honoured at his death i say that a birth before its time is better than he
 in wind it came and to the dark it will go and with the dark will its name be covered
 yes it saw not the sun and it had no knowledge it is better with this than with the other
 and though he goes on living a thousand years twice over and does not see good are not the two going to the same place
 all the work of man is for his mouth and still he has a desire for food
 what have the wise more than the foolish and what has the poor man by walking wisely before the living
 what the eyes see is better than the wandering of desire this is to no purpose and a desire for wind
 that which is has been named before and of what man is there is knowledge he has no power against one stronger than he
 there are words without number for increasing what is to no purpose but what is man profited by them
 who is able to say what is good for man in life all the days of his foolish life which he goes through like a shade who will say what is to be after him under the sun
 a good name is better than oil of great price and the day of death than the day of birth
 it is better to go to the house of weeping than to go to the house of feasting because that is the end of every man and the living will take it to their hearts
 sorrow is better than joy when the face is sad the mind gets better
 the hearts of the wise are in the house of weeping but the hearts of the foolish are in the house of joy
 it is better to take note of the protest of the wise than for a man to give ear to the song of the foolish
 like the cracking of thorns under a pot so is the laugh of a foolish man and this again is to no purpose
 the wise are troubled by the ways of the cruel and the giving of money is the destruction of the heart
 the end of a thing is better than its start and a gentle spirit is better than pride
 be not quick to let your spirit be angry because wrath is in the heart of the foolish
 say not why were the days which have gone by better than these such a question comes not from wisdom
 wisdom together with a heritage is good and a profit to those who see the sun
 wisdom keeps a man from danger even as money does but the value of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to its owner
 give thought to the work of god who will make straight what he has made bent
 in the day of wealth have joy but in the day of evil take thought god has put the one against the other so that man may not be certain what will be after him
 these two have i seen in my life which is to no purpose a good man coming to his end in his righteousness and an evil man whose days are long in his evil doing
 be not given overmuch to righteousness and be not over wise why let destruction come on you
 be not evil overmuch and be not foolish why come to your end before your time
 it is good to take this in your hand and not to keep your hand from that he who has the fear of god will be free of the two
 wisdom makes a wise man stronger than ten rulers in a town
 there is no man on earth of such righteousness that he does good and is free from sin all his days
 do not give ear to all the words which men say for fear of hearing the curses of your servant
 your heart has knowledge how frequently others have been cursed by you
 all this i have put to the test by wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me
 far off is true existence and very deep who may have knowledge of it
 i gave my mind to knowledge and to searching for wisdom and the reason of things and to the discovery that sin is foolish and that to be foolish is to be without ones senses
 and i saw a thing more bitter than death even the woman whose heart is full of tricks and nets and whose hands are as bands he with whom god is pleased will get free from her but the sinner will be taken by her
 look  this i have seen said the preacher taking one thing after another to get the true account
 for which my soul is still searching but i have it not one man among a thousand have i seen but a woman among all these i have not seen
 this only have i seen that god made men upright but they have been searching out all sorts of inventions
 who is like the wise man and to whom is the sense of anything clear a mans wisdom makes his face shining and his hard face will be changed
 i say to you keep the kings law from respect for the oath of god
 be not quick to go from before him be not fixed in an evil design because he does whatever is pleasing to him
 the word of a king has authority and who may say to him what is this you are doing
 whoever keeps the law will come to no evil and a wise mans heart has knowledge of time and of decision
 for every purpose there is a time and a decision because the sorrow of man is great in him
 no one is certain what is to be and who is able to say to him when it will be
 no man has authority over the wind to keep the wind or is ruler over the day of his death in war no mans time is free and evil will not keep the sinner safe
 all this have i seen and have given my heart to all the work which is done under the sun there is a time when man has power over man for his destruction
 and then i saw evil men put to rest taken even from the holy place and they went about and were praised in the town because of what they had done this again is to no purpose
 because punishment for an evil work comes not quickly the minds of the sons of men are fully given to doing evil
 though a sinner does evil a hundred times and his life is long i am certain that it will be well for those who go in fear of god and are in fear before him
 but it will not be well for the evil doer he will not make his days long like a shade because he has no fear before god
 there is a thing which is to no purpose done on the earth that there are good men to whom is given the same punishment as those who are evil and there are evil men who get the reward of the good i say that this again is to no purpose
 so i gave praise to joy because there is nothing better for a man to do under the sun than to take meat and drink and be happy for that will be with him in his work all the days of his life which god gives him under the sun
 when i gave my mind to the knowledge of wisdom and to seeing the business which is done on the earth  and there are those whose eyes see not sleep by day or by night 
 then i saw all the work of god and that man may not get knowledge of the work which is done under the sun because if a man gives hard work to the search he will not get knowledge and even if the wise man seems to be coming to the end of his search still he will be without knowledge
 all this i took to heart and my heart saw it all that the upright and the wise and their works are in the hand of god and men may not be certain if it will be love or hate all is to no purpose before them
 because to all there is one event to the upright man and to the evil to the clean and to the unclean to him who makes an offering and to him who makes no offering as is the good so is the sinner he who takes an oath is as he who has fear of it
 this is evil in all things which are done under the sun that there is one fate for all and the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil while they have life their hearts are foolish and after that  to the dead
 for him who is joined to all the living there is hope a living dog is better than a dead lion
 the living are conscious that death will come to them but the dead are not conscious of anything and they no longer have a reward because there is no memory of them
 their love and their hate and their envy are now ended and they have no longer a part for ever in anything which is done under the sun
 come take your bread with joy and your wine with a glad heart god has taken pleasure in your works
 let your clothing be white at all times and let not your head be without oil
 have joy with the woman of your love all the days of your foolish life which he gives you under the sun because that is your part in life and in your work which you do under the sun
 whatever comes to your hand to do with all your power do it because there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in the place of the dead to which you are going
 and again i saw under the sun that the reward goes not to him who is quick or the fruits of war to the strong and there is no bread for the wise or wealth for men of learning or respect for those who have knowledge but time and chance come to all
 even man has no knowledge of his time like fishes taken in an evil net or like birds taken by deceit are the sons of men taken in an evil time when it comes suddenly on them
 this again i have seen under the sun as wisdom and it seemed great to me
 there was a little town and the number of its men was small and there came a great king against it and made an attack on it building works of war round about it
 now there was in the town a poor wise man and he by his wisdom kept the town safe but no one had any memory of that same poor man
 then i said wisdom is better than strength but the poor mans wisdom is not respected and his words are not given a hearing
 the words of the wise which come quietly to the ear are noted more than the cry of a ruler among the foolish
 wisdom is better than instruments of war but one sinner is the destruction of much good
 now it came about in the days of ahasuerus  that ahasuerus who was ruler of a hundred and twenty seven divisions of the kingdom from india as far as ethiopia 
 that in those days when king ahasuerus was ruling in shushan his strong town
 in the third year of his rule he gave a feast to all his captains and his servants and the captains of the army of persia and media the great men and the rulers of the divisions of his kingdom were present before him
 and for a long time even a hundred and eighty days he let them see all the wealth and the glory of his kingdom and the great power and honour which were his
 and at the end of that time the king gave a feast for all the people who were present in shushan the kings town small as well as great for seven days in the outer square of the garden of the kings house
 there were fair hangings of white and green and blue fixed with cords of purple and the best linen to silver rings and pillars of polished stone the seats were of gold and silver on a floor of red and white and yellow and black stone
 and they gave them drink in gold vessels every vessel being different and wine of the kingdom freely given by the king
 and the drinking was in keeping with the law no one was forced for the king had given orders to all the chief servants of his house to do as was pleasing to every man
 and vashti the queen gave a feast for the women in the house of king ahasuerus
 on the seventh day when the heart of the king was glad with wine he gave orders to mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven unsexed servants who were waiting before ahasuerus the king
 that vashti the queen was to come before him crowned with her crown and let the people and the captains see her for she was very beautiful
 but when the servants gave her the kings order vashti the queen said she would not come then the king was very angry and his heart was burning with wrath
 and the king said to the wise men who had knowledge of the times  for this was the kings way with all who were expert in law and in the giving of decisions
 and second only to him were carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven rulers of persia and media who were friends of the king and had the first places in the kingdom 
 what is to be done by law to vashti the queen because she has not done what king ahasuerus by his servants gave her orders to do
 and before the king and the captains memucan gave his answer vashti the queen has done wrong not only to the king but to all the captains and to all the peoples in all the divisions of the kingdom of king ahasuerus
 for news of what the queen has done will come to the ears of all women and they will no longer give respect to their husbands when it is said to them king ahasuerus gave orders for vashti the queen to come before him and she came not
 and the wives of the captains of persia and media hearing what the queen has done will say the same to all the kings captains so there will be much shame and wrath
 if it is pleasing to the king let an order go out from him and let it be recorded among the laws of the persians and the medes so that it may never be changed that vashti is never again to come before king ahasuerus and let the king give her place to another who is better than she
 and when this order given by the king is made public through all his kingdom  for it is great  all the wives will give honour to their husbands great as well as small
 and this suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains and the king did as memucan said
 and sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom to every division in the writing commonly used there and to every people in the language which was theirs saying that every man was to be the ruler in his house and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people
 and king ahasuerus put a tax on the land and on the islands of the sea
 and all his acts of power and his great strength and the full story of the high place which the king gave mordecai are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of media and persia
 for mordecai the jew was second only to king ahasuerus and great among the jews and respected by the body of his countrymen working for the good of his people and saying words of peace to all his seed
 after these things when the kings feelings were calmer the thought of vashti and what she had done and the order he had made against her came back to his mind
 then the servants who were waiting on the king said to him let search be made for some fair young virgins for the king
 let the king give authority to certain men in all the divisions of his kingdom to get together all the fair young virgins and send them to shushan the kings town to the womens house under the care of hegai the kings servant the keeper of the women and let the things needed for making them clean be given to them
 and let the girl who is pleasing to the king be queen in place of vashti and the king was pleased with this suggestion and he did so
 now there was a certain jew in shushan named mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite
 who had been taken away from jerusalem among those who had been made prisoner with jeconiah king of judah when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had taken him away
 and he had been a father to hadassah that is esther the daughter of his fathers brother for she had no father or mother and she was very beautiful and when her father and mother were dead mordecai took her for his daughter
 so when the order made by the king was publicly given out and a number of girls had been placed in the care of hegai in the kings house in shushan esther was taken into the kings house and put in the care of hegai the keeper of the women
 and he was pleased with the girl and was kind to her and he quickly gave her what was needed for making her clean and the things which were hers by right and seven servant girls who were to be hers from the kings house and he had her and her servant girls moved to the best place in the womens part of the house
 esther had not said what family or people she came from for mordecai had given her orders not to do so
 and every day mordecai took his walk before the square of the womens house to see how esther was and what would be done to her
 now every girl when her turn came had to go in to king ahasuerus after undergoing for a space of twelve months what was ordered by the law for the women  for this was the time necessary for making them clean that is six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet perfumes and such things as are needed for making women clean 
 and in this way the girl went in to the king whatever she had a desire for was given to her to take with her from the womens house into the house of the king
 in the evening she went and on the day after she came back to the second house of the women into the keeping of shaashgaz one of the kings unsexed servants who had the care of the kings wives only if the king had delight in her and sent for her by name did she go in to him again
 now when the time came for esther the daughter of abihail his fathers brother whom mordecai had taken as his daughter to go in to the king she made request for nothing but what hegai the kings servant and keeper of the women had given her and esther was looked on kindly by all who saw her
 so esther was taken in to king ahasuerus in his house in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his rule
 and esther was more pleasing to the king than all the women and to his eyes she was fairer and more full of grace than all the other virgins so he put his crown on her head and made her queen in place of vashti
 then the king gave a great feast for all his captains and his servants even esthers feast and he gave orders through all the divisions of his kingdom for a day of rest from work and gave wealth from his store
 and when the virgins came together in the second house of the women mordecai took his seat in the doorway of the kings house
 esther had still said nothing of her family or her people as mordecai had given her orders for esther did what mordecai said as when she was living with him
 in those days while mordecai was seated at the kings doorway two of the kings servants bigthan and teresh keepers of the door being angry were looking for a chance to make an attack on king ahasuerus
 and mordecai having knowledge of their purpose sent word of it to esther the queen and esther gave the news to the king in mordecais name
 and when the thing had been looked into it was seen to be true and the two of them were put to death by hanging on a tree and it was put down in the records before the king
 after these things by the order of the king haman the son of hammedatha the agagite was lifted up and given a position of honour and a higher place than all the other captains who were with him
 and all the kings servants who were in the kings house went down to the earth before haman and gave him honour for so the king had given orders but mordecai did not go down before him or give him honour
 then the kings servants who were in the kings house said to mordecai why do you go against the kings order
 now when they had said this to him day after day and he gave no attention they let haman have news of it to see if mordecais behaviour would be overlooked for he had said to them that he was a jew
 and when haman saw that mordecai did not go down before him and give him honour haman was full of wrath
 but it was not enough for him to make an attack on mordecai only for they had made clear to him who mordecais people were so haman made it his purpose to put an end to all the jews even mordecais people through all the kingdom of ahasuerus
 in the first month the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus from day to day and from month to month they went on looking for a sign given by pur  that is chance  before haman till the sign came out for the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month adar
 and haman said to king ahasuerus there is a certain nation living here and there in small groups among the people in all the divisions of your kingdom their laws are different from those of any other nation and they do not keep the kings laws for this reason it is not right for the king to let them be
 if it is the kings pleasure let a statement ordering their destruction be put in writing and i will give to those responsible for the kings business ten thousand talents of silver for the kings store house
 and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the hater of the jews
 and the king said to haman the money is yours and the people to do with them whatever seems right to you
 then on the thirteenth day of the first month the kings scribes were sent for and they put in writing hamans orders to all the kings captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there and to every people in the language which was theirs it was signed in the name of king ahasuerus and stamped with the kings ring
 and letters were sent by the runners into every division of the kingdom ordering the death and destruction of all jews young and old little children and women on the same day even the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month adar and the taking of all their goods by force
 a copy of the writing to be made public in every part of the kingdom was sent out to all the peoples so that they might be ready when that day came
 the runners went out quickly by the kings order and a public statement was made in shushan and the king and haman took wine together but the town of shushan was troubled
 now when mordecai saw what was done pulling off his robe he put on haircloth with dust on his head and went out into the middle of the town crying out with a loud and bitter cry
 and he came even before the kings doorway for no one might come inside the kings door clothed in haircloth
 and in every part of the kingdom wherever the kings word and his order came there was great sorrow among the jews and weeping and crying and going without food and numbers of them were stretched on the earth covered with dust and haircloth
 and esthers women and her servants came and gave her word of it then great was the grief of the queen and she sent robes for mordecai so that his clothing of haircloth might be taken off but he would not have them
 then esther sent for hathach one of the kings unsexed servants whom he had given her for waiting on her and she gave him orders to go to mordecai and see what this was and why it was
 so hathach went out and saw mordecai in the open square of the town before the kings doorway
 and mordecai gave him an account of what had taken place and of the amount of money which haman had said he would put into the kings store for the destruction of the jews
 and he gave him the copy of the order which had been given out in shushan for their destruction ordering him to let esther see it and to make it clear to her and to say to her that she was to go in to the king requesting his mercy and making prayer for her people
 and hathach came back and gave esther an account of what mordecai had said
 then esther sent hathach to say to mordecai
 it is common knowledge among all the kings servants and the people of every part of the kingdom that if anyone man or woman comes to the king in his inner room without being sent for there is only one law for him that he is to be put to death only those to whom the kings rod of gold is stretched out may keep their lives but i have not been sent for to come before the king these thirty days
 and they said these words to mordecai
 then mordecai sent this answer back to esther do not have the idea that you in the kings house will be safe from the fate of all the jews
 if at this time you say nothing then help and salvation will come to the jews from some other place but you and your fathers family will come to destruction and who is to say that you have not come to the kingdom even for such a time as this
 then esther sent them back to mordecai with this answer
 go get together all the jews who are present in shushan and go without food for me taking no food or drink night or day for three days and i and my women will do the same and so i will go in to the king which is against the law and if death is to be my fate then let it come
 so mordecai went away and did everything as esther had said
 now on the third day esther put on her queens robes and took her place in the inner room of the kings house facing the kings house and the king was seated on his high seat in the kings house facing the doorway of the house
 and when the king saw esther the queen waiting in the inner room looking kindly on her he put out the rod of gold in his hand to her so esther came near and put her fingers on the top of the rod
 then the king said what is your desire queen esther and what is your request i will give it to you even to the half of my kingdom
 and esther in answer said if it seems good to the king let the king and haman come today to the feast which i have made ready for him
 then the king said let haman come quickly so that what esther has said may be done so the king and haman came to the feast which esther had made ready
 and while they were drinking wine the king said to esther what is your prayer for it will be given to you and what is your request for it will be done even to the half of my kingdom
 then esther said in answer my prayer and my request is this
 if i have the kings approval and if it is the kings pleasure to give me my prayer and do my request let the king and haman come to the feast which i will make ready for them and tomorrow i will do as the king has said
 then on that day haman went out full of joy and glad in heart but when he saw mordecai in the kings doorway and he did not get to his feet or give any sign of fear before him haman was full of wrath against mordecai
 but controlling himself he went to his house and he sent for his friends and zeresh his wife
 and he gave them an account of the glories of his wealth and the number of children he had and the ways in which he had been honoured by the king and how he had put him over the captains and servants of the king
 and haman said further truly esther the queen let no man but myself come in to the feast which she had made ready for the king and tomorrow again i am to be her guest with the king
 but all this is nothing to me while i see mordecai the jew seated by the kings doorway
 then his wife zeresh and all his friends said to him let a pillar fifty cubits high be made ready for hanging him and in the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of mordecai then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with a glad heart and haman was pleased with the suggestion and he had the pillar made
 that night the king was unable to get any sleep and he sent for the books of the records and while some one was reading them to the king
 it came out that it was recorded in the book how mordecai had given word of the designs of bigthana and teresh two of the kings servants keepers of the door by whom an attack on the king had been designed
 and the king said what honour and reward have been given to mordecai for this then the servants who were waiting on the king said nothing has been done for him
 then the king said who is in the outer room now haman had come into the outer room to get the kings authority for the hanging of mordecai on the pillar which he had made ready for him
 and the kings servants said to him see haman is waiting in the outer room and the king said let him come in
 so haman came in and the king said to him what is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring then the thought came into hamans mind whom more than myself would the king have pleasure in honouring
 and haman answering the king said for the man whom the king has delight in honouring
 let them take the robes which the king generally puts on and the horse on which the king goes and the crown which is on his head
 and let the robes and the horse be given to one of the kings most noble captains so that they may put them on the man whom the king has delight in honouring and let him go on horseback through the streets of the town with men crying out before him so let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring
 then the king said to haman go quickly and take the robes and the horse as you have said and do even so to mordecai the jew who is seated at the kings doorway see that you do everything as you have said
 then haman took the robes and the horse and dressing mordecai in the robes he made him go on horseback through the streets of the town crying out before him so let it be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring
 and mordecai came back to the kings doorway but haman went quickly back to his house sad and with his head covered
 and haman gave his wife zeresh and all his friends an account of what had taken place then his wise men and his wife zeresh said to him if mordecai who is starting to get the better of you is of the seed of the jews you will not be able to do anything against him but you will certainly go down before him
 while they were still talking the kings servants came to take haman to the feast which esther had made ready
 so the king and haman came to take wine with esther the queen
 and the king said to esther again on the second day while they were drinking what is your prayer queen esther for it will be given to you and what is your request for it will be done even to the half of my kingdom
 then esther the queen answering said if i have your approval o king and if it is the kings pleasure let my life be given to me in answer to my prayer and my people at my request
 for we are given up i and my people to destruction and death and to be cut off if we had been taken as men servants and women servants for a price i would have said nothing for our trouble is little in comparison with the kings loss
 then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart
 and esther said our hater and attacker is this evil haman then haman was full of fear before the king and the queen
 and the king in his wrath got up from the feast and went into the garden and haman got to his feet to make a prayer for his life to esther the queen for he saw that the kings purpose was evil against him
 then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking and haman was stretched out on the seat where esther was then the king said is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house and while the words were on the kings lips they put a cloth over hamans face
 then harbonah one of the unsexed servants waiting before the king said see the pillar fifty cubits high which haman made for mordecai who said a good word for the king is still in its place in hamans house then the king said put him to death by hanging him on it
 so haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he had made for mordecai then the kings wrath became less
 that day the king gave all the family of haman the hater of the jews to esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had made clear what he was to her
 and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it to mordecai and esther put mordecai over the family of haman
 then esther again came before the king falling down at his feet and made request to him with weeping that he would put a stop to the evil purposes of haman the agagite and the designs which he had made against the jews
 then the king put out the rod of gold to esther and she got up before the king
 and she said if it is the kings pleasure and if i have his approval and this thing seems right to the king and i am pleasing to him then let letters be sent giving orders against those which haman the son of hammedatha the agagite sent out for the destruction of the jews in all divisions of the kingdom
 for how is it possible for me to see the evil which is to overtake my nation how may i see the destruction of my people
 then king ahasuerus said to esther the queen and to mordecai the jew see now i have given esther the family of haman and he has come to his death by hanging because he made an attack on the jews
 so now send a letter about the jews writing whatever seems good to you in the kings name and stamping it with the kings ring for a writing signed in the kings name and stamped with the kings ring may not be changed
 then at that time on the twenty third day of the third month which is the month sivan the kings scribes were sent for and everything ordered by mordecai was put in writing and sent to the jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the divisions of the kingdom from india to ethiopia a hundred and twenty seven divisions to every division in the writing commonly used there and to every people in their language and to the jews in their writing and their language
 the letters were sent in the name of king ahasuerus and stamped with his ring and they were taken by men on horseback going on the quick running horses used for the kings business the offspring of his best horses
 in these letters the king gave authority to the jews in every town to come together and make a fight for their lives and to send death and destruction on the power of any people in any part of the kingdom attacking them or their children or their women and to take their goods from them by force
 on one day in every division of the kingdom of ahasuerus that is on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month adar
 a copy of the writing to be made public as an order in every division of the kingdom was given out to all the peoples so that the jews might be ready when that day came to give punishment to their haters
 so the men went out on the quick running horses used on the kings business wasting no time and forced on by the kings order and the order was given out in shushan the kings town
 and mordecai went out from before the king dressed in king like robes of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and clothing of purple and the best linen and all the town of shushan gave loud cries of joy
 and the jews had light and joy and honour
 and in every part of the kingdom and in every town wherever the kings letter and his order came the jews were glad with great joy and had a feast and a good day and a great number of the people of the land became jews for the fear of the jews had come on them
 now on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar when the time came for the kings order to be put into effect on the very day when the haters of the jews had been hoping to have rule over them though the opposite had come about and the jews had rule over their haters
 on that day the jews came together in their towns through all the divisions of the kingdom of ahasuerus for the purpose of attacking all those who were attempting evil against them and everyone had to give way before them for the fear of them had come on all the peoples
 and all the chiefs and the captains and the rulers and those who did the kings business gave support to the jews because the fear of mordecai had come on them
 for mordecai was great in the kings house and word of him went out through every part of the kingdom for the man mordecai became greater and greater
 so the jews overcame all their attackers with the sword and with death and destruction and did to their haters whatever they had a desire to do
 and in shushan the jews put to death five hundred men
 they put to death parshandatha dalphon aspatha
 poratha adalia aridatha
 parmashta arisai aridai and vaizatha
 the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the hater of the jews but they put not a hand on any of their goods
 on that day the number of those who had been put to death in the town of shushan was given to the king
 and the king said to esther the queen the jews have put five hundred men to death in shushan as well as the ten sons of haman what then have they done in the rest of the kingdom  now what is your prayer for it will be given to you what other request have you and it will be done
 then esther said if it is the kings pleasure let authority be given to the jews in shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today and let orders be given for the hanging of hamans ten sons
 and the king said that this was to be done and the order was given out in shushan and the hanging of hamans ten sons was effected
 for the jews who were in shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month adar and put to death three hundred men in shushan but they put not a hand on their goods
 and the other jews in every division of the kingdom came together fighting for their lives and got salvation from their haters and put seventy five thousand of them to death but they did not put a hand on their goods
 this they did on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same month they took their rest and made it a day of feasting and joy
 but the jews in shushan came together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth day of the month and on the fifteenth day they took their rest and made it a day of feasting and joy
 so the jews of the country places living in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of feasting and joy and a good day a day for sending offerings one to another
 and mordecai sent letters to all the jews in every division of the kingdom of ahasuerus near and far
 ordering them to keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same month every year
 as days on which the jews had rest from their haters and the month which for them was turned from sorrow to joy and from weeping to a good day and that they were to keep them as days of feasting and joy of sending offerings to one another and good things to the poor
 and the jews gave their word to go on as they had been doing and as mordecai had given them orders in writing
 because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the hater of all the jews had made designs for their destruction attempting to get a decision by pur  that is chance  with a view to putting an end to them and cutting them off
 but when the business was put before the king he gave orders by letters that the evil design which he had made against the jews was to be turned against himself and that he and his sons were to be put to death by hanging
 so these days were named purim after the name of pur and so because of the words of this letter and of what they had seen in connection with this business and what had come to them
 the jews made a rule and gave an undertaking causing their seed and all those who were joined to them to do the same so that it might be in force for ever that they would keep those two days as ordered in the letter at the fixed time every year
 and that those days were to be kept in memory through every generation and every family in every division of the kingdom and every town that there might never be a time when these days of purim would not be kept among the jews or when the memory of them would go from the minds of their seed
 then esther the queen daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew sent a second letter giving the force of their authority to the order about the purim
 and he sent letters to all the jews in the hundred and twenty seven divisions of the kingdom of ahasuerus with true words of peace
 giving the force of law to these days of purim at their fixed times as they had been ordered by mordecai the jew and esther the queen and in keeping with the rules they had made for themselves and their seed in connection with their time of going without food and their cry for help
 the order given by esther gave the force of law to the rules about the purim and it was recorded in the book
 now these are the names of the sons of israel who came into egypt every man and his family came with jacob
 reuben simeon levi and judah
 issachar zebulun and benjamin
 dan and naphtali gad and asher
 all the offspring of jacob were seventy persons and joseph had come to egypt before them
 then joseph came to his end and all his brothers and all that generation
 and the children of israel were fertile increasing very greatly in numbers and in power and the land was full of them
 now a new king came to power in egypt who had no knowledge of joseph
 and he said to his people see the people of israel are greater in number and in power than we are
 let us take care for fear that their numbers may become even greater and if there is a war they may be joined with those who are against us and make an attack on us and go up out of the land
 so they put overseers of forced work over them in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work and they made store towns for pharaoh pithom and raamses
 but the more cruel they were to them the more their number increased till all the land was full of them and the children of israel were hated by the egyptians
 and they gave the children of israel even harder work to do
 and made their lives bitter with hard work making building material and bricks and doing all sorts of work in the fields under the hardest conditions
 and the king of egypt said to the hebrew women who gave help at the time of childbirth  the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah 
 when you are looking after the hebrew women in childbirth if it is a son you are to put him to death but if it is a daughter she may go on living
 but the women had the fear of god and did not do as the king of egypt said but let the male children go on living
 and the king of egypt sent for the women and said to them why have you done this and let the male children go on living
 and they said to pharaoh because the hebrew women are not like the egyptian women for they are strong and the birth takes place before we come to them
 and the blessing of god was on these women and the people were increased in number and became very strong
 and because the women who took care of the hebrew mothers had the fear of god he gave them families
 and pharaoh gave orders to all his people saying every son who comes to birth is to be put into the river but every daughter may go on living
 and the lord said to moses go in to pharaoh for i have made his heart and the hearts of his servants hard so that i may let my signs be seen among them
 and so that you may be able to give to your son and to your sons son the story of my wonders in egypt and the signs which i have done among them so that you may see that i am the lord
 then moses and aaron went in to pharaoh and said to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says how long will you be lifted up in your pride before me let my people go so that they may give me worship
 for if you will not let my people go tomorrow i will send locusts into your land
 and the face of the earth will be covered with them so that you will not be able to see the earth and they will be the destruction of everything which up to now has not been damaged everything which was not crushed by the ice storm and every tree still living in your fields
 and your houses will be full of them and the houses of your servants and of all the egyptians it will be worse than anything your fathers have seen or their fathers from the day when they were living on the earth till this day and so he went out from pharaoh
 and pharaohs servants said to him how long is this man to be the cause of evil to us let the men go so that they may give worship to the lord their god are you not awake to egypts danger
 then moses and aaron came in again before pharaoh and he said to them go and give worship to the lord your god but which of you are going
 and moses said we will go with our young and our old with our sons and our daughters with our flocks and our herds for we are to keep a feast to the lord
 and he said to them may the lord be with you if i will let you and your little ones go  take care for your purpose clearly is evil
 not so but let your males go and give worship to the lord as your desire is this he said driving them out from before him
 and the lord said to moses let your hand be stretched out over the land of egypt so that the locusts may come up on the land for the destruction of every green plant in the land even everything untouched by the ice storm
 and moses rod was stretched out over the land of egypt and the lord sent an east wind over the land all that day and all the night and in the morning the locusts came up with the east wind
 and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt resting on every part of the land in very great numbers such an army of locusts had never been seen before and never will be again
 for all the face of the earth was covered with them so that the land was black and every green plant and all the fruit of the trees which was untouched by the ice storm they took for food not one green thing no plant or tree was to be seen in all the land of egypt
 then pharaoh quickly sent for moses and aaron and said i have done evil against the lord your god and against you
 let me now have forgiveness for my sin this time only and make prayer to the lord your god that he will take away from me this death only
 so he went out from pharaoh and made prayer to the lord
 and the lord sent a very strong west wind which took up the locusts driving them into the red sea not one locust was to be seen in any part of egypt
 but the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he did not let the children of israel go
 and the lord said to moses let your hand be stretched out to heaven and all the land of egypt will be dark so that men will be feeling their way about in the dark
 and when moses hand was stretched out dark night came over all the land of egypt for three days
 they were not able to see one another and no one got up from his place for three days but where the children of israel were living it was light
 then pharaoh sent for moses and said go and give worship to the lord only let your flocks and your herds be kept here your little ones may go with you
 but moses said you will have to let us take burned offerings to put before the lord our god
 so our cattle will have to go with us not one may be kept back for they are needed for the worship of the lord our god we have no knowledge what offering we have to give till we come to the place
 but the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he would not let them go
 and pharaoh said to him go away from me take care that you come not again before me for the day when you see my face again will be your last
 and moses said you say truly i will not see your face again
 and the lord said to moses i will send one more punishment on pharaoh and on egypt after that he will let you go and when he does let you go he will not keep one of you back but will send you out by force
 so go now and give orders to the people that every man and every woman is to get from his or her neighbour ornaments of silver and of gold
 and the lord gave the people grace in the eyes of the egyptians for the man moses was highly honoured in the land of egypt by pharaohs servants and the people
 and moses said this is what the lord says about the middle of the night i will go out through egypt
 and death will come to every mothers first male child in all the land of egypt from the child of pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the servant girl crushing the grain and the first births of all the cattle
 and there will be a great cry through all the land of egypt such as never has been or will be again
 but against the children of israel man or beast not so much as the tongue of a dog will be moved so that you may see how the lord makes a division between israel and the egyptians
 and all these your servants will come to me going down on their faces before me and saying go out and all your people with you and after that i will go out and he went away from pharaoh burning with wrath
 and the lord said to moses pharaoh will not give ear to you so that my wonders may be increased in the land of egypt
 all these wonders moses and aaron did before pharaoh but the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he did not let the children of israel go out of his land
 and the lord said to moses and aaron in the land of egypt
 let this month be to you the first of months the first month of the year
 say to all the children of israel when they are come together in the tenth day of this month every man is to take a lamb by the number of their fathers families a lamb for every family
 and if the lamb is more than enough for the family let that family and its nearest neighbour have a lamb between them taking into account the number of persons and how much food is needed for every man
 let your lamb be without a mark a male in its first year you may take it from among the sheep or the goats
 keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month when everyone who is of the children of israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark
 then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken
 and let your food that night be the flesh of the lamb cooked with fire in the oven together with unleavened bread and bitter tasting plants
 do not take it uncooked or cooked with boiling water but let it be cooked in the oven its head with its legs and its inside parts
 do not keep any of it till the morning anything which is not used is to be burned with fire
 and take your meal dressed as if for a journey with your shoes on your feet and your sticks in your hands take it quickly it is the lords passover
 for on that night i will go through the land of egypt sending death on every first male child of man and of beast and judging all the gods of egypt i am the lord
 and the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are when i see the blood i will go over you and no evil will come on you for your destruction when my hand is on the land of egypt
 and this day is to be kept in your memories you are to keep it as a feast to the lord through all your generations as an order for ever
 for seven days let your food be unleavened bread from the first day no leaven is to be seen in your houses whoever takes bread with leaven in it from the first till the seventh day will be cut off from israel
 and on the first day there is to be a holy meeting and on the seventh day a holy meeting no sort of work may be done on those days but only to make ready what is necessary for everyones food
 so keep the feast of unleavened bread for on this very day i have taken your armies out of the land of egypt this day then is to be kept through all your generations by an order for ever
 in the first month from the evening of the fourteenth day let your food be unleavened bread till the evening of the twenty first day of the month
 for seven days no leaven is to be seen in your houses for whoever takes bread which is leavened will be cut off from the people of israel if he is from another country or if he is an israelite by birth
 take nothing which has leaven in it wherever you are living let your food be unleavened cakes
 then moses sent for the chiefs of israel and said to them see that lambs are marked out for yourselves and your families and let the passover lamb be put to death
 and take some hyssop and put it in the blood in the basin touching the two sides and the top of the doorway with the blood from the basin and let not one of you go out of his house till the morning
 for the lord will go through the land sending death on the egyptians and when he sees the blood on the two sides and the top of the door the lord will go over your door and will not let death come in for your destruction
 and you are to keep this as an order to you and to your sons for ever
 and when you come into the land which the lord will make yours as he gave his word you are to keep this act of worship
 and when your children say to you what is the reason of this act of worship
 then you will say this is the offering of the lords passover for he went over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he sent death on the egyptians and kept our families safe and the people gave worship with bent heads
 and the children of israel went and did so as the lord had given orders to moses and aaron so they did
 and in the middle of the night the lord sent death on every first male child in the land of egypt from the child of pharaoh on his seat of power to the child of the prisoner in the prison and the first births of all the cattle
 then pharaoh got up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and a great cry went up from egypt for there was not a house where someone was not dead
 and he sent for moses and aaron by night and said get up and go out from among my people you and the children of israel go and give worship to the lord as you have said
 and take your flocks and your herds as you have said and be gone and give me your blessing
 and the egyptians were forcing the people on to get them out of the land quickly for they said we are all dead men
 and the people took their bread paste before it was leavened putting their basins in their clothing on their backs
 and the children of israel had done as moses had said and they got from the egyptians ornaments of silver and of gold and clothing
 and the lord had given the people grace in the eyes of the egyptians so that they gave them whatever was requested so they took away all their goods from the egyptians
 and the children of israel made the journey from rameses to succoth there were about six hundred thousand men on foot as well as children
 and a mixed band of people went with them and flocks and herds in great numbers
 and they made unleavened cakes from the paste which they had taken out of egypt it was not leavened for they had been sent out of egypt so quickly that they had no time to make any food ready
 now the children of israel had been living in egypt for four hundred and thirty years
 and at the end of four hundred and thirty years to the very day all the armies of the lord went out of the land of egypt
 it is a watch night before the lord who took them out of the land of egypt this same night is a watch night to the lord for all the children of israel through all their generations
 and the lord said to moses and aaron this is the law of the passover no man who is not an israelite is to take of it
 but every mans servant whom he has got for money may take of it when he has had circumcision
 a man from a strange country living among you and a servant working for payment may not take part in it
 it is to be taken in one house not a bit of the flesh is to be taken out of the house and no bone of it may be broken
 all israel is to keep the feast
 and if a man from another country is living with you and has a desire to keep the passover to the lord let all the males of his family undergo circumcision and then let him come near and keep it for he will then be as one of your people but no one without circumcision may keep it
 the law is the same for him who is an israelite by birth and for the man from a strange country who is living with you
 so the children of israel did as the lord gave orders to moses and aaron
 and on that very day the lord took the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies
 and the lord said to moses
 let the first male child of every mother among the children of israel be kept holy for me even the first male birth among man or beast for it is mine
 and moses said to the people let this day on which you came out of egypt out of your prison house be kept for ever in memory for by the strength of his hand the lord has taken you out from this place let no leavened bread be used
 on this day in the month abib you are going out
 and it will be that when the lord takes you into the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the hivite and the jebusite the land which he made an oath to your fathers that he would give you a land flowing with milk and honey you will do this act of worship in this month
 for seven days let your food be unleavened cakes and on the seventh day there is to be a feast to the lord
 unleavened cakes are to be your food through all the seven days let no leavened bread be seen among you or any leaven in any part of your land
 and you will say to your son in that day it is because of what the lord did for me when i came out of egypt
 and this will be for a sign to you on your hand and for a mark on your brow so that the law of the lord may be in your mouth for with a strong hand the lord took you out of egypt
 so let this order be kept at the right time from year to year
 and when the lord takes you into the land of canaan as he made his oath to you and to your fathers and gives it to you
 you are to put on one side for the lord every mothers first male child the first fruit of her body and the first young one of every beast every male is holy to the lord
 and for the young of an ass you may give a lamb in payment or if you will not make payment for it its neck is to be broken but for all the first sons among your children let payment be made
 and when your son says to you in time to come what is the reason for this say to him by the strength of his hand the lord took us out of egypt out of the prison house
 and when pharaoh made his heart hard and would not let us go the lord sent death on all the first sons in egypt of man and of beast and so every first male who comes to birth is offered to the lord but for all the first of my sons i give a price
 and this will be for a sign on your hand and for a mark on your brow for by the strength of his hand the lord took us out of egypt
 now after pharaoh had let the people go god did not take them through the land of the philistines though that was near for god said if the people see war they may have a change of heart and go back to egypt
 but god took the people round by the waste land near the red sea and the children of israel went up in fighting order out of the land of egypt
 and moses took the bones of joseph with him for joseph had made the children of israel take an oath saying god will certainly keep you in mind and you are to take my bones away with you
 then they went on their journey from succoth and put up their tents in etham at the edge of the waste land
 and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud guiding them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they were able to go on day and night
 the pillar of cloud went ever before them by day and the pillar of fire by night
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to the children of israel to go back and put up their tents before pi hahiroth between migdol and the sea in front of baal zephon opposite to which you are to put up your tents by the sea
 and pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are wandering without direction they are shut in by the waste land
 and i will make pharaohs heart hard and he will come after them and i will be honoured over pharaoh and all his army so that the egyptians may see that i am the lord and they did so
 and word came to pharaoh of the flight of the people and the feeling of pharaoh and of his servants about the people was changed and they said why have we let israel go so that they will do no more work for us
 so he had his war carriage made ready and took his people with him
 and he took six hundred carriages all the carriages of egypt and captains over all of them
 and the lord made the heart of pharaoh hard and he went after the children of israel for the children of israel had gone out without fear
 but the egyptians went after them all the horses and carriages of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them in their tents by the sea by pihahiroth before baal zephon
 and when pharaoh came near the children of israel lifting up their eyes saw the egyptians coming after them and were full of fear and their cry went up to god
 and they said to moses was there no resting place for the dead in egypt that you have taken us away to come to our death in the waste land why have you taken us out of egypt
 did we not say to you in egypt let us be as we are working for the egyptians for it is better to be the servants of the egyptians than to come to our death in the waste land
 but moses said keep where you are and have no fear now you will see the salvation of the lord which he will give you today for the egyptians whom you see today you will never see again
 the lord will make war for you you have only to keep quiet
 and the lord said to moses why are you crying out to me give the children of israel the order to go forward
 and let your rod be lifted up and your hand stretched out over the sea and it will be parted in two and the children of israel will go through on dry land
 and i will make the heart of the egyptians hard and they will go in after them and i will be honoured over pharaoh and over his army his war carriages and his horsemen
 and the egyptians will see that i am the lord when i get honour over pharaoh and his war carriages and his horsemen
 then the angel of god who had been before the tents of israel took his place at their back and the pillar of cloud moving from before them came to rest at their back
 and it came between the army of egypt and the army of israel and there was a dark cloud between them and they went on through the night but the one army came no nearer to the other all the night
 and when moses hand was stretched out over the sea the lord with a strong east wind made the sea go back all night and the waters were parted in two and the sea became dry land
 and the children of israel went through the sea on dry land and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left
 then the egyptians went after them into the middle of the sea all pharaohs horses and his war carriages and his horsemen
 and in the morning watch the lord looking out on the armies of the egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud sent trouble on the army of the egyptians
 and made the wheels of their war carriages stiff so that they had hard work driving them so the egyptians said let us go in flight from before the face of israel for the lord is fighting for them against the egyptians
 and the lord said to moses let your hand be stretched out over the sea and the waters will come back again on the egyptians and on their war carriages and on their horsemen
 and when moses hand was stretched out over the sea at dawn the sea came flowing back meeting the egyptians in their flight and the lord sent destruction on the egyptians in the middle of the sea
 and the waters came back covering the war carriages and the horsemen and all the army of pharaoh which went after them into the middle of the sea not one of them was to be seen
 but the children of israel went through the sea walking on dry land and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left
 so that day the lord gave israel salvation from the hands of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead on the seas edge
 and israel saw the great work which the lord had done against the egyptians and the fear of the lord came on the people and they had faith in the lord and in his servant moses
 then moses and the children of israel made this song to the lord and said i will make a song to the lord for he is lifted up in glory the horse and the horseman he has sent down into the sea
 the lord is my strength and my strong helper he has become my salvation he is my god and i will give him praise my fathers god and i will give him glory
 the lord is a man of war the lord is his name
 pharaohs war carriages and his army he has sent down into the sea the best of his captains have gone down into the red sea
 they were covered by the deep waters like a stone they went down under the waves
 full of glory o lord is the power of your right hand by your right hand those who came against you are broken
 when you are lifted up in power all those who come against you are crushed when you send out your wrath they are burned up like dry grass
 by your breath the waves were massed together the flowing waters were lifted up like a pillar the deep waters became solid in the heart of the sea
 egypt said i will go after them i will overtake i will make division of their goods my desire will have its way with them my sword will be uncovered my hand will send destruction on them
 you sent your wind and the sea came over them they went down like lead into the great waters
 who is like you o lord among the gods who is like you in holy glory to be praised with fear doing wonders
 when your right hand was stretched out the mouth of the earth was open for them
 in your mercy you went before the people whom you have made yours guiding them in your strength to your holy place
 hearing of you the peoples were shaking in fear the people of philistia were gripped with pain
 the chiefs of edom were troubled in heart the strong men of moab were in the grip of fear all the people of canaan became like water
 fear and grief came on them by the strength of your arm they were turned to stone till your people went over o lord till the people went over whom you have made yours
 you will take them in planting them in the mountain of your heritage the place o lord where you have made your house the holy place o lord the building of your hands
 the lord is king for ever and ever
 for the horses of pharaoh with his war carriages and his horsemen went into the sea and the lord sent the waters of the sea back over them but the children of israel went through the sea on dry land
 and miriam the woman prophet the sister of aaron took an instrument of music in her hand and all the women went after her with music and dances
 and miriam answering said make a song to the lord for he is lifted up in glory the horse and the horseman he has sent into the sea
 then moses took israel forward from the red sea and they went out into the waste land of shur and for three days they were in the waste land where there was no water
 and when they came to marah the water was no good for drinking for the waters of marah were bitter which is why it was named marah
 and the people crying out against moses said what are we to have for drink
 and in answer to his prayer the lord made him see a tree and when he put it into the water the water was made sweet there he gave them a law and an order testing them
 and he said if with all your heart you will give attention to the voice of the lord your god and do what is right in his eyes giving ear to his orders and keeping his laws i will not put on you any of the diseases which i put on the egyptians for i am the lord your life giver
 and they came to elim where there were twelve water springs and seventy palm trees and they put up their tents there by the waters
 and they went on their way from elim and all the children of israel came into the waste land of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after they went out of the land of egypt
 and all the children of israel were crying out against moses and aaron in the waste land
 and the children of israel said to them it would have been better for the lord to have put us to death in the land of egypt where we were seated by the flesh pots and had bread enough for our needs for you have taken us out to this waste of sand to put all this people to death through need of food
 then the lord said to moses see i will send down bread from heaven for you and the people will go out every day and get enough for the days needs so that i may put them to the test to see if they will keep my laws or not
 and on the sixth day they are to make ready what they get in and it will be twice as much as they get on the other days
 and moses and aaron said to all the children of israel this evening it will be clear to you that it is the lord who has taken you out of the land of egypt
 and in the morning you will see the glory of the lord for your angry words against the lord have come to his ears and what are we that you are crying out against us
 and moses said the lord will give you meat for your food at evening and in the morning bread in full measure for your outcry against the lord has come to his ears for what are we your outcry is not against us but against the lord
 and moses said to aaron say to all the people of israel come near before the lord for he has given ear to your outcry
 and while aaron was talking to the children of israel their eyes were turned in the direction of the waste land and they saw the glory of the lord shining in the cloud
 and the lord said to moses
 the outcry of the children of israel has come to my ears say to them now at nightfall you will have meat for your food and in the morning bread in full measure and you will see that i am the lord your god
 and it came about that in the evening little birds came up and the place was covered with them and in the morning there was dew all round about the tents
 and when the dew was gone on the face of the earth was a small round thing like small drops of ice on the earth
 and when the children of israel saw it they said to one another what is it for they had no idea what it was and moses said to them it is the bread which the lord has given you for your food
 this is what the lord has said let every man take up as much as he has need of at the rate of one omer for every person let every man take as much as is needed for his family
 and the children of israel did so and some took more and some less
 and when it was measured he who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough every man had taken what he was able to make use of
 and moses said to them let nothing be kept till the morning
 but they gave no attention to moses and some of them kept it till the morning and there were worms in it and it had an evil smell and moses was angry with them
 and they took it up morning by morning every man as he had need and when the sun was high it was gone
 and on the sixth day they took up twice as much of the bread two omers for every person and all the rulers of the people gave moses word of it
 and he said this is what the lord has said tomorrow is a day of rest a holy sabbath to the lord what has to be cooked may be cooked and what is over put on one side to be kept till the morning
 and they kept it till the morning as moses had said and no smell came from it and it had no worms
 and moses said make your meal today of what you have for this day is a sabbath to the lord today you will not get any in the fields
 for six days you will get it but on the seventh day the sabbath there will not be any
 but still on the seventh day some of the people went out to get it and there was not any
 and the lord said to moses how long will you go against my orders and my laws
 see because the lord has given you the sabbath he gives you on the sixth day bread enough for two days let every man keep where he is let no man go out of his place on the seventh day
 so the people took their rest on the seventh day
 and this bread was named manna by israel it was white like a grain seed and its taste was like cakes made with honey
 and moses said this is the order which the lord has given let one omer of it be kept for future generations so that they may see the bread which i gave you for your food in the waste land when i took you out from the land of egypt
 and moses said to aaron take a pot and put one omer of manna in it and put it away before the lord to be kept for future generations
 so aaron put it away in front of the holy chest to be kept as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the children of israel had manna for their food for forty years till they came to a land with people in it till they came to the edge of the land of canaan
 now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
 and the children of israel went on from the waste land of sin by stages as the lord gave them orders and put up their tents in rephidim and there was no drinking water for the people
 so the people were angry with moses and said give us water for drinking and moses said why are you angry with me and why do you put god to the test
 and the people were in great need of water and they made an outcry against moses and said why have you taken us out of egypt to send death on us and our children and our cattle through need of water
 and moses crying out to the lord said what am i to do to this people they are almost ready to put me to death by stoning
 and the lord said to moses go on before the people and take some of the chiefs of israel with you and take in your hand the rod which was stretched out over the nile and go
 see i will take my place before you on the rock in horeb and when you give the rock a blow water will come out of it and the people will have drink and moses did so before the eyes of the chiefs of israel
 and he gave that place the name massah and meribah because the children of israel were angry and because they put the lord to the test saying is the lord with us or not
 then amalek came and made war on israel in rephidim
 and moses said to joshua get together a band of men for us and go out make war on amalek tomorrow i will take my place on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand
 so joshua did as moses said to him and went to war with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill
 now while moses hand was lifted up israel was the stronger but when he let his hand go down amalek became the stronger
 but moses hands became tired so they put a stone under him and he took his seat on it aaron and hur supporting his hands one on one side and one on the other so his hands were kept up without falling till the sun went down
 and joshua overcame amalek and his people with the sword
 and the lord said to moses make a record of this in a book so that it may be kept in memory and say it again in the ears of joshua that all memory of amalek is to be completely uprooted from the earth
 then moses put up an altar and gave it the name of yahweh nissi
 for he said the lord has taken his oath that there will be war with amalek from generation to generation
 now news came to jethro the priest of midian moses father in law of all god had done for moses and for israel his people and how the lord had taken israel out of egypt
 and jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her away
 and her two sons one of whom was named gershom for he said i have been living in a strange land
 and the name of the other was eliezer for he said the god of my father was my help and kept me safe from the sword of pharaoh
 and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife to where moses had put up his tent in the waste land by the mountain of god
 and he said to moses i your father in law have come to you with your wife and your two sons
 and moses went out to his father in law and went down on his face before him and gave him a kiss and they said to one another are you well and they came into the tent
 and moses gave his father in law an account of all the lord had done to pharaoh and to the egyptians because of israel and of all the troubles which had come on them by the way and how the lord had given them salvation
 and jethro was glad because the lord had been good to israel freeing them from the power of the egyptians
 and jethro said praise be to the lord who has taken you out of the hand of pharaoh and out of the hand of the egyptians freeing the people from the yoke of the egyptians
 now i am certain that the lord is greater than all gods for he has overcome them in their pride
 then jethro moses father in law made a burned offering to god and aaron came with the chiefs of israel and had a meal with moses father in law before god
 now on the day after moses took his seat to give decisions for the people and the people were waiting before moses from morning till evening
 and when moses father in law saw all he was doing he said what is this you are doing for the people why are you seated here by yourself with all the people waiting before you from morning till evening
 and moses said to his father in law because the people come to me to get directions from god
 and if they have any question between themselves they come to me and i am judge between a man and his neighbour and i give them the orders and laws of god
 and moses father in law said to him what you are doing is not good
 your strength and that of the people will be completely used up this work is more than you are able to do by yourself
 give ear now to my suggestion and may god be with you you are to be the peoples representative before god taking their causes to him
 teaching them his rules and his laws guiding them in the way they have to go and making clear to them the work they have to do
 but for the rest take from among the people able men such as have the fear of god true men hating profits wrongly made and put such men over them to be captains of thousands captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens
 and let them be judges in the causes of the people at all times and let them put before you all important questions but in small things let them give decisions themselves in this way it will be less hard for you and they will take the weight off you
 if you do this and god gives approval then you will be able to go on without weariness and all this people will go to their tents in peace
 so moses took note of the words of his father in law and did as he had said
 and he made selection of able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people captains of thousands captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens
 and they were judges in the causes of the people at all times the hard questions they put before moses but on every small point they gave decisions themselves
 and moses let his father in law go away and he went back to his land
 in the third month after the children of israel went out from egypt on the same day they came into the waste land of sinai
 and when they had gone away from rephidim and had come into the waste land of sinai they put up their tents in the waste land before the mountain there israel put up its tents
 and moses went up to god and the voice of the lord came to him from the mountain saying say to the family of jacob and give word to the children of israel
 you have seen what i did to the egyptians and how i took you as on eagles wings guiding you to myself
 if now you will truly give ear to my voice and keep my agreement you will be my special property out of all the peoples for all the earth is mine
 and you will be a kingdom of priests to me and a holy nation these are the words which you are to say to the children of israel
 and moses came and sent for the chiefs of the people and put before them all these words which the lord had given him orders to say
 and all the people answering together said whatever the lord has said we will do and moses took back to the lord the words of the people
 and the lord said to moses see i will come to you in a thick cloud so that what i say to you may come to the ears of the people and they may have belief in you for ever and moses gave the lord word of what the people had said
 and the lord said to moses go to the people and make them holy today and tomorrow and let their clothing be washed
 and by the third day let them be ready for on the third day the lord will come down on mount sinai before the eyes of all the people
 and let limits be marked out for the people round the mountain and say to them take care not to go up the mountain or near the sides of it whoever puts his foot on the mountain will certainly come to his death
 he is not to be touched by a hand but is to be stoned or have an arrow put through him man or beast he is to be put to death at the long sounding of a horn they may come up to the mountain
 then moses went down from the mountain to the people and made the people holy and their clothing was washed
 and he said to the people be ready by the third day do not come near a woman
 and when morning came on the third day there were thunders and flames and a thick cloud on the mountain and a horn sounding very loud and all the people in the tents were shaking with fear
 and moses made the people come out of their tents and take their places before god and they came to the foot of the mountain
 and all the mountain of sinai was smoking for the lord had come down on it in fire and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a great burning and all the mountain was shaking
 and when the sound of the horn became louder and louder moses words were answered by the voice of god
 then the lord came down on to mount sinai to the top of the mountain and the lord sent for moses to come up to the top of the mountain and moses went up
 and the lord said to moses go down and give the people orders to keep back for fear that a great number of them forcing their way through to see the lord may come to destruction
 and let the priests who come near to the lord make themselves holy for fear that the lord may come on them suddenly
 and moses said to the lord the people will not be able to come up the mountain for you gave us orders to put limits round the mountain marking it out and making it holy
 and the lord said to him go down and you and aaron may come up but let not the priests and the people make their way through to the lord or he will come on them suddenly
 so moses went down to the people and said this to them
 now a man of the house of levi took as his wife a daughter of levi
 and she became with child and gave birth to a son and when she saw that he was a beautiful child she kept him secretly for three months
 and when she was no longer able to keep him secret she made him a basket out of the stems of water plants pasting sticky earth over it to keep the water out and placing the baby in it she put it among the plants by the edge of the nile
 and his sister took her place at a distance to see what would become of him
 now pharaohs daughter came down to the nile to take a bath while her women were walking by the riverside and she saw the basket among the river plants and sent her servant girl to get it
 and opening it she saw the child and he was crying and she had pity on him and said this is one of the hebrews children
 then his sister said to pharaohs daughter may i go and get you one of the hebrew women to give him the breast
 and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the girl went and got the childs mother
 and pharaohs daughter said to her take the child away and give it milk for me and i will give you payment and the woman took the child and gave it milk at her breast
 and when the child was older she took him to pharaohs daughter and he became her son and she gave him the name moses because she said i took him out of the water
 now when moses had become a man one day he went out to his people and saw how hard their work was and he saw an egyptian giving blows to a hebrew one of his people
 and turning this way and that and seeing no one he put the egyptian to death covering his body with sand
 and he went out the day after and saw two of the hebrews fighting and he said to him who was in the wrong why are you fighting your brother
 and he said who made you a ruler and a judge over us are you going to put me to death as you did the egyptian and moses was in fear and said it is clear that the thing has come to light
 now when pharaoh had news of this he would have put moses to death but moses went in flight from pharaoh into the land of midian and he took his seat by a water spring
 now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came to get water for their fathers flock
 and the keepers of the sheep came up and were driving them away but moses got up and came to their help watering their flock for them
 and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that you have come back so quickly today
 and they said an egyptian came to our help against the keepers of sheep and got water for us and gave it to the flock
 and he said to his daughters where is he why have you let the man go make him come in and give him a meal
 and moses was happy to go on living with the man and he gave his daughter zipporah to moses
 and she gave birth to a son to whom he gave the name gershom for he said i have been living in a strange land
 now after a long time the king of egypt came to his end and the children of israel were crying in their grief under the weight of their work and their cry for help came to the ears of god
 and at the sound of their weeping the agreement which god had made with abraham and isaac and jacob came to his mind
 and gods eyes were turned to the children of israel and he gave them the knowledge of himself
 and god said all these words
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt out of the prison house
 you are to have no other gods but me
 you are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth
 you may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship for i the lord your god am a god who will not give his honour to another and i will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers to the third and fourth generation of my haters
 and i will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws
 you are not to make use of the name of the lord your god for an evil purpose whoever takes the lords name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the lord
 keep in memory the sabbath and let it be a holy day
 on six days do all your work
 but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on that day you are to do no work you or your son or your daughter your man servant or your woman servant your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you
 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and the sea and everything in them and he took his rest on the seventh day for this reason the lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy
 give honour to your father and to your mother so that your life may be long in the land which the lord your god is giving you
 do not put anyone to death without cause
 do not be false to the married relation
 do not take the property of another
 do not give false witness against your neighbour
 let not your desire be turned to your neighbours house or his wife or his man servant or his woman servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is his
 and all the people were watching the thunderings and the flames and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking and when they saw it they kept far off shaking with fear
 and they said to moses to your words we will give ear but let not the voice of god come to our ears for fear death may come on us
 and moses said to the people have no fear for god has come to put you to the test so that fearing him you may be kept from sin
 and the people kept their places far off but moses went near to the dark cloud where god was
 and the lord said to moses say to the children of israel you yourselves have seen that my voice has come to you from heaven
 gods of silver and gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves
 make for me an altar of earth offering on it your burned offerings and your peace offerings your sheep and your oxen in every place where i have put the memory of my name i will come to you and give you my blessing
 and if you make me an altar of stone do not make it of cut stones for the touch of an instrument will make it unclean
 and do not go up by steps to my altar for fear that your bodies may be seen uncovered
 now these are the laws which you are to put before them
 if you get a hebrew servant for money he is to be your servant for six years and in the seventh year you are to let him go free without payment
 if he comes to you by himself let him go away by himself if he is married let his wife go away with him
 if his master gives him a wife and he gets sons or daughters by her the wife and her children will be the property of the master and the servant is to go away by himself
 but if the servant says clearly my master and my wife and children are dear to me i have no desire to be free
 then his master is to take him to the gods of the house and at the door or at its framework he is to make a hole in his ear with a sharp pointed instrument and he will be his servant for ever
 and if a man gives his daughter for a price to be a servant she is not to go away free as the men servants do
 if she is not pleasing to her master who has taken her for himself let a payment be made for her so that she may go free her master has no power to get a price for her and send her to a strange land because he has been false to her
 and if he gives her to his son he is to do everything for her as if she was his daughter
 and if he takes another woman her food and clothing and her married rights are not to be less
 and if he does not do these three things for her she has the right to go free without payment
 he who gives a man a death blow is himself to be put to death
 but if he had no evil purpose against him and god gave him into his hand i will give you a place to which he may go in flight
 but if a man makes an attack on his neighbour on purpose to put him to death by deceit you are to take him from my altar and put him to death
 any man who gives a blow to his father or his mother is certainly to be put to death
 any man who gets another into his power in order to get a price for him is to be put to death if you take him in the act
 any man cursing his father or his mother is to be put to death
 if in a fight one man gives another a blow with a stone or with the shut hand not causing his death but making him keep in bed
 if he is able to get up again and go about with a stick the other will be let off only he will have to give him payment for the loss of his time and see that he is cared for till he is well
 if a man gives his man servant or his woman servant blows with a rod causing death he is certainly to undergo punishment
 but at the same time if the servant goes on living for a day or two the master is not to get punishment for the servant is his property
 if men while fighting do damage to a woman with child causing the loss of the child but no other evil comes to her the man will have to make payment up to the amount fixed by her husband in agreement with the decision of the judges
 but if damage comes to her let life be given in payment for life
 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
 burning for burning wound for wound blow for blow
 if a man gives his man servant or his woman servant a blow in the eye causing its destruction he is to let him go free on account of the damage to his eye
 or if the loss of a tooth is caused by his blow he will let him go free on account of his tooth
 if an ox comes to be the cause of death to a man or a woman the ox is to be stoned and its flesh may not be used for food but the owner will not be judged responsible
 but if the ox has frequently done such damage in the past and the owner has had word of it and has not kept it under control so that it has been the cause of the death of a man or woman not only is the ox to be stoned but its owner is to be put to death
 if a price is put on his life let him make payment of whatever price is fixed
 if the death of a son or of a daughter has been caused the punishment is to be in agreement with this rule
 if the death of a man servant or of a woman servant is caused by the ox the owner is to give their master thirty shekels of silver and the ox is to be stoned
 if a man makes a hole in the earth without covering it up and an ox or an ass dropping into it comes to its death
 the owner of the hole is responsible he will have to make payment to their owner but the dead beast will be his
 and if one mans ox does damage to another mans ox causing its death then the living ox is to be exchanged for money and division made of the price of it and of the price of the dead one
 but if it is common knowledge that the ox has frequently done such damage in the past and its owner has not kept it under control he will have to give ox for ox and the dead beast will be his
 if a man takes without right another mans ox or his sheep and puts it to death or gets a price for it he is to give five oxen for an ox or four sheep for a sheep in payment the thief will have to make payment for what he has taken if he has no money he himself will have to be exchanged for money so that payment may be made
 if a thief is taken in the act of forcing his way into a house and his death is caused by a blow the owner of the house is not responsible for his blood
 but if it is after dawn he will be responsible
 if he still has what he had taken whatever it is ox or ass or sheep he is to give twice its value
 if a man makes a fire in a field or a vine garden and lets the fire do damage to another mans field he is to give of the best produce of his field or his vine garden to make up for it
 if there is a fire and the flames get to the thorns at the edge of the field causing destruction of the cut grain or of the living grain or of the field he who made the fire will have to make up for the damage
 if a man puts money or goods in the care of his neighbour to keep for him and it is taken from the mans house if they get the thief he will have to make payment of twice the value
 if they do not get the thief let the master of the house come before the judges and take an oath that he has not put his hand on his neighbours goods
 in any question about an ox or an ass or a sheep or clothing or about the loss of any property which anyone says is his let the two sides put their cause before god and he who is judged to be in the wrong is to make payment to his neighbour of twice the value
 if a man puts an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast into the keeping of his neighbour and it comes to death or is damaged or is taken away without any person seeing it
 if he takes his oath before the lord that he has not put his hand to his neighbours goods the owner is to take his word for it and he will not have to make payment for it
 but if it is taken from him by a thief he is to make up for the loss of it to its owner
 but if it has been damaged by a beast and he is able to make this clear he will not have to make payment for what was damaged
 if a man gets from his neighbour the use of one of his beasts and it is damaged or put to death when the owner is not with it he will certainly have to make payment for the loss
 if the owner is with it he will not have to make payment if he gave money for the use of it the loss is covered by the payment
 if a man takes a virgin who has not given her word to another man and has connection with her he will have to give a bride price for her to be his wife
 if her father will not give her to him on any account he will have to give the regular payment for virgins
 any woman using unnatural powers or secret arts is to be put to death
 any man who has sex connection with a beast is to be put to death
 complete destruction will come on any man who makes offerings to any other god but the lord
 do no wrong to a man from a strange country and do not be hard on him for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of egypt
 do no wrong to a widow or to a child whose father is dead
 if you are cruel to them in any way and their cry comes up to me i will certainly give ear
 and in the heat of my wrath i will put you to death with the sword so that your wives will be widows and your children without fathers
 if you let any of the poor among my people have the use of your money do not be a hard creditor to him and do not take interest
 if ever you take your neighbours clothing in exchange for the use of your money let him have it back before the sun goes down
 for it is the only thing he has for covering his skin what is he to go to sleep in and when his cry comes up to me i will give ear for my mercy is great
 you may not say evil of the judges or put a curse on the ruler of your people
 do not keep back your offerings from the wealth of your grain and your vines the first of your sons you are to give to me
 in the same way with your oxen and your sheep for seven days let the young one be with its mother on the eighth day give it to me
 you are to be holy men to me the flesh of no animal whose death has been caused by the beasts of the field may be used for your food it is to be given to the dogs
 do not let a false statement go further do not make an agreement with evil doers to be a false witness
 do not be moved to do wrong by the general opinion or give the support of your words to a wrong decision
 but on the other hand do not be turned from what is right in order to give support to a poor mans cause
 if you come across the ox or the ass of one who is no friend to you wandering from its way you are to take it back to him
 if you see the ass of one who has no love for you bent down to the earth under the weight which is put on it you are to come to its help even against your desire
 let no wrong decisions be given in the poor mans cause
 keep yourselves far from any false business never let the upright or him who has done no wrong be put to death for i will make the evil doer responsible for his sin
 take no rewards in a cause for rewards make blind those who have eyes to see and make the decisions of the upright false
 do not be hard on the man from a strange country who is living among you for you have had experience of the feelings of one who is far from the land of his birth because you yourselves were living in egypt in a strange land
 for six years put seed into your fields and get in the increase
 but in the seventh year let the land have a rest and be unplanted so that the poor may have food from it and let the beasts of the field take the rest do the same with your vine gardens and your olive trees
 for six days do your work and on the seventh day keep the sabbath so that your ox and your ass may have rest together with the son of your servant and the man from a strange land living among you
 take note of all these things which i have said to you and let not the names of other gods come into your minds or from your lips
 three times in the year you are to keep a feast to me

 but if you truly give ear to his voice and do whatever i say then i will be against those who are against you fighting those who are fighting you
 and my angel will go before you guiding you into the land of the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the canaanite and the hivite and the jebusite and they will be cut off by my hand

 and give worship to the lord your god who will send his blessing on your bread and on your water and i will take all disease away from among you

 i will send my fear before you putting to flight all the people to whom you come all those who are against you will go in flight turning their backs before you
 i will send hornets before you driving out the hivite and the canaanite and the hittite before your face
 i will not send them all out in one year for fear that their land may become waste and the beasts of the field be increased overmuch against you
 little by little i will send them away before you till your numbers are increased and you take up your heritage in the land
 i will let the limits of your land be from the red sea to the sea of the philistines and from the waste land to the river euphrates for i will give the people of those lands into your power and you will send them out before you
 make no agreement with them or with their gods
 let them not go on living in your land or they will make you do evil against me for if you give worship to their gods it will certainly be a cause of sin to you
 and he said to moses come up to the lord you and aaron and nadab and abihu and seventy of the chiefs of israel and give me worship from a distance
 and moses only may come near to the lord but the others are not to come near and the people may not come up with them

 and he sent some of the young men of the children of israel to make burned offerings and peace offerings of oxen to the lord
 and moses took half the blood and put it in basins draining out half of the blood over the altar
 and he took the book of the agreement reading it in the hearing of the people and they said everything which the lord has said we will do and we will keep his laws

 and they saw the god of israel and under his feet there was as it seemed a jewelled floor clear as the heavens
 and he put not his hand on the chiefs of the children of israel they saw god and took food and drink
 and the lord said to moses come up to me on the mountain and take your place there and i will give you the stones on which i have put in writing the law and the orders so that you may give the people knowledge of them

 and he said to the chiefs keep your places here till we come back to you aaron and hur are with you if anyone has any cause let him go to them
 and moses went up into the mountain and it was covered by the cloud
 and the glory of the lord was resting on mount sinai and the cloud was over it for six days and on the seventh day he said moses name out of the cloud

 among the children of israel i will make my living place and i will be their god
 and they will see that i am the lord their god who took them out of the land of egypt so that i might be ever with them i am the lord their god
 now moses was looking after the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he took the flock to the back of the waste land and came to horeb the mountain of god
 and the angel of the lord was seen by him in a flame of fire coming out of a thorn tree and he saw that the tree was on fire but it was not burned up
 and moses said i will go and see this strange thing why the tree is not burned up
 and when the lord saw him turning to one side to see god said his name out of the tree crying moses moses and he said here am i
 and he said do not come near take off your shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy
 and he said i am the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses kept his face covered for fear of looking on god
 and god said truly i have seen the grief of my people in egypt and their cry because of their cruel masters has come to my ears for i have knowledge of their sorrows
 and i have come down to take them out of the hands of the egyptians guiding them out of that land into a good land and wide into a land flowing with milk and honey into the place of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
 for now truly the cry of the children of israel has come to me and i have seen the cruel behaviour of the egyptians to them
 come then and i will send you to pharaoh so that you may take my people the children of israel out of egypt
 and moses said to god who am i to go to pharaoh and take the children of israel out of egypt
 and he said truly i will be with you and this will be the sign to you that i have sent you when you have taken the children of israel out of egypt you will give worship to god on this mountain
 and moses said to god when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what am i to say to them
 and god said to him i am what i am and he said say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you
 and god went on to say to moses say to the children of israel the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob has sent me to you this is my name for ever and this is my sign to all generations
 go and get together the chiefs of the children of israel and say to them the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob has been seen by me and has said truly i have taken up your cause because of what is done to you in egypt
 and i have said i will take you up out of the sorrows of egypt into the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite into a land flowing with milk and honey
 and they will give ear to your voice and you with the chiefs of israel will go to pharaoh the king of egypt and say to him the lord the god of the hebrews has come to us let us then go three days journey into the waste land to make an offering to the lord our god
 and i am certain that the king of egypt will not let you go without being forced
 but i will put out my hand and overcome egypt with all the wonders which i will do among them and after that he will let you go
 and i will give this people grace in the eyes of the egyptians so that when you go out you will go out with your hands full
 for every woman will get from her neighbour and from the woman living in her house ornaments of silver and gold and clothing and you will put them on your sons and your daughters you will take the best of their goods from the egyptians
 and you are to make an altar for the burning of perfume of hard wood let it be made
 the altar is to be square a cubit long and a cubit wide and two cubits high and its horns are to be made of the same
 it is to be plated with the best gold the top of it and the sides and the horns with an edging of gold all round it
 under the edge on the two opposite sides you are to make two gold rings to take the rods for lifting it
 and make these rods of the same wood plating them with gold
 and let it be placed in front of the veil before the ark of the law before the cover which is over the law where i will come face to face with you
 and on this altar sweet spices are to be burned by aaron every morning when he sees to the lights
 and every evening when he puts the lights up in their places the spices are to be burned a sweet smelling smoke going up before the lord from generation to generation for ever
 no strange perfume no burned offering or meal offering and no drink offering is to be offered on it
 and once every year aaron is to make its horns clean with the blood of the sin offering he is to make it clean once every year from generation to generation it is most holy to the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 when you are taking the number of the children of israel let every man who is numbered give to the lord a price for his life so that no disease may come on them when they are numbered
 and this is what they are to give let every man who is numbered give half a shekel by the scale of the holy place  the shekel being valued at twenty gerahs  this money is an offering to the lord
 everyone who is numbered from twenty years old and over is to give an offering to the lord
 the man of wealth is to give no more and the poor man no less than the half shekel of silver when the offering is made to the lord as the price for your lives
 and you are to take this money from the children of israel to be used for the work of the tent of meeting to keep the memory of the children of israel before the lord and to be the price of your lives
 and the lord said to moses
 you are to make a brass washing vessel with a brass base and put it between the tent of meeting and the altar with water in it
 that it may be used by aaron and his sons for washing their hands and feet
 whenever they go into the tent of meeting they are to be washed with water to keep them from death and whenever they come near to do the work of the altar or to make an offering by fire to the lord
 their hands and feet are to be washed so that they may be safe from death this is an order to them for ever to him and his seed from generation to generation
 and the lord said to moses
 take the best spices five hundred shekels weight of liquid myrrh and of sweet cinnamon half as much that is two hundred and fifty shekels and two hundred and fifty shekels of sweet calamus
 and of cassia five hundred shekels weight measured by the scale of the holy place and of olive oil a hin
 and make these into a holy oil a perfume made by the art of the perfume maker it is to be a holy oil
 this oil is to be put on the tent of meeting and on the ark of the law
 and on the table and all its vessels and on the support for the lights with its vessels and on the altar for burning spices
 and on the altar of burned offerings with its vessels and on the washing vessel and its base
 and you are to make them most holy anything touching them will become holy
 and put the oil on aaron and his sons making them holy to do the work of priests to me
 and say to the children of israel this is to be the lords holy oil from generation to generation
 it is not to be used for mans flesh and no other is to be made like it holy it is and you are to keep it holy
 whoever makes any like it or puts it on one who is not a priest will be cut off from his people
 and the lord said to moses take sweet spices stacte and onycha and galbanum with the best frankincense in equal weights
 and make from them a perfume such as is made by the art of the perfume maker mixed with salt and clean and holy
 and put some of it crushed very small in front of the ark in the tent of meeting where i will come face to face with you it is to be most holy
 you are not to make any perfume like it for yourselves it is to be kept holy to the lord
 whoever makes any like it for its sweet smell will be cut off from his people
 and the lord said to moses
 i have made selection of bezalel the son of uri by name the son of hur of the tribe of judah
 and i have given him the spirit of god and made him wise and full of knowledge and expert in every sort of handwork
 to do all sorts of delicate work in gold and silver and brass
 in cutting stones for framing and to do every form of woodwork
 and i have made selection of oholiab with him the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan and in the hearts of all who are wise i have put the knowledge to make whatever i have given you orders to have made
 the tent of meeting and the ark of the law and the cover which is on it and all the things for the tent
 and the table with its vessels and the holy light support with all its vessels and the altar for the burning of spices
 and the altar of burned offerings with all its vessels and the washing vessel with its base
 and the robes of needlework the holy robes for aaron and for his sons for their use when acting as priests
 and the holy oil and the perfume of sweet spices for the holy place they will do whatever i have given you orders to have done
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel that they are to keep my sabbaths for the sabbath day is a sign between me and you through all your generations so that you may see that i am the lord who makes you holy
 so you are to keep the sabbath as a holy day and anyone not honouring it will certainly be put to death whoever does any work on that day will be cut off from his people
 six days may work be done but the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest holy to the lord whoever does any work on the sabbath day is to be put to death
 and the children of israel are to keep the sabbath holy from generation to generation by an eternal agreement
 it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever because in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he took his rest and had pleasure in it
 and when his talk with moses on mount sinai was ended he gave him the two stones of the law two stones on which was the writing made by the finger of god
 and when the people saw that moses was a long time coming down from the mountain they all came to aaron and said to him come make us a god to go before us as for this moses who took us up out of the land of egypt we have no idea what has become of him
 then aaron said to them take off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives and your sons and your daughters and give them to me
 and all the people took the gold rings from their ears and gave them to aaron
 and he took the gold from them and hammering it with an instrument he made it into the metal image of a young ox and they said this is your god o israel who took you out of the land of egypt
 and when aaron saw this he made an altar before it and made a public statement saying tomorrow there will be a feast to the lord
 so early on the day after they got up and made burned offerings and peace offerings and took their seats at the feast and then gave themselves to pleasure
 and the lord said to moses go down quickly for your people whom you took out of the land of egypt are turned to evil ways
 even now they are turned away from the rule i gave them and have made themselves a metal ox and given worship to it and offerings saying this is your god o israel who took you up out of the land of egypt
 and the lord said to moses i have been watching this people and i see that they are a stiff necked people
 now do not get in my way for my wrath is burning against them i will send destruction on them but of you i will make a great nation
 but moses made prayer to god saying lord why is your wrath burning against your people whom you took out of the land of egypt with great power and with the strength of your hand
 why let the egyptians say he took them out to an evil fate to put them to death on the mountains cutting them off from the earth let your wrath be turned away from them and send not this evil on your people
 have in mind abraham isaac and israel your servants to whom you gave your oath saying i will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number and all this land will i give to your seed as i said to be their heritage for ever
 so the lord let himself be turned from his purpose of sending punishment on his people
 then moses came down the mountain with the two stones of the law in his hand the stones had writing on their two sides on the front and on the back
 the stones were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god cut on the stones
 now when the noise and the voices of the people came to the ears of joshua he said to moses there is a noise of war in the tents
 and moses said it is not the voice of men who are overcoming in the fight or the cry of those who have been overcome it is the sound of songs which comes to my ear
 and when he came near the tents he saw the image of the ox and the people dancing and in his wrath moses let the stones go from his hands and they were broken at the foot of the mountain
 and he took the ox which they had made burning it in the fire and crushing it to powder and he put it in the water and made the children of israel take a drink of it
 and moses said to aaron what did the people do to you that you let this great sin come on them
 and aaron said let not my lord be angry you have seen how the purposes of this people are evil
 for they said to me make us a god to go before us as for this moses who took us up out of the land of egypt we have no idea what has come to him
 then i said to them whoever has any gold let him take it off so they gave it to me and i put it in the fire and this image of an ox came out
 and moses saw that the people were out of control for aaron had let them loose to their shame before their haters
 then moses took his place at the way into the tents and said whoever is on the lords side let him come to me and all the sons of levi came together to him
 and he said to them this is the word of the lord the god of israel let every man take his sword at his side and go from one end of the tents to the other putting to death his brother and his friend and his neighbour
 and the sons of levi did as moses said and about three thousand of the people were put to death that day
 and moses said you have made yourselves priests to the lord this day for every one of you has made the offering of his son and his brother the blessing of the lord is on you this day
 and on the day after moses said to the people great has been your sin but i will go up to the lord and see if i may get forgiveness for your sin
 then moses went back to the lord and said this people has done a great sin making themselves a god of gold
 but now if you will give them forgiveness  but if not let my name be taken out of your book
 and the lord said to moses whoever has done evil against me will be taken out of my book
 but now go take the people into that place of which i have given you word see my angel will go before you but when the time of my judging has come i will send punishment on them for their sin
 and the lord sent punishment on the people because they gave worship to the ox which aaron made
 and the lord said to moses go forward from this place you and the people whom you have taken up out of the land of egypt to that land about which i made an oath to abraham isaac and jacob saying to your seed will i give it
 and i will send an angel before you driving out the canaanite and the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
 go up to that land flowing with milk and honey but i will not go up among you for you are a stiff necked people for fear that i send destruction on you while you are on the way
 hearing this bad news the people were full of grief and no one put on his ornaments
 and the lord said to moses say to the children of israel you are a stiff necked people if i come among you even for a minute i will send destruction on you so take off all your ornaments so that i may see what to do with you
 so the children of israel took off their ornaments at mount horeb and did not put them on again
 now it was moses way to put up the tent of meeting outside the tent circle at some distance away giving it the name of the tent of meeting and everyone desiring to make his prayer to the lord went to the tent of meeting outside the tent circle
 and whenever moses went out to the tent of meeting all the people got up and everyone went to the door of his tent looking after moses till he went inside the tent
 and whenever moses went into the tent the pillar of cloud came down and took its place by the door of the tent as long as the lord was talking with moses
 and all the people saw the cloud at the door of the tent and they went down on their faces everyone at the door of his tent
 and the lord had talk with moses face to face as a man may have talk with his friend and when moses came back to the tents his servant the young man joshua the son of nun did not come away from the tent
 and moses said to the lord see you say to me be this peoples guide on their journey but you have not made clear to me whom you will send with me but you have said i have knowledge of you by name and you have grace in my eyes
 if then i have grace in your eyes let me see your ways so that i may have knowledge of you and be certain of your grace and my prayer is that you will keep in mind that this nation is your people
 and he said i myself will go with you and give you rest
 and moses said if you yourself are not going with us do not send us on from here
 for is not the fact of your going with us the sign that i and this people have grace in your eyes so that we that is i and your people are separate from all other people on the face of the earth
 and the lord said to moses i will do as you say for you have grace in my eyes and i have knowledge of you by your name
 and moses said o lord let me see your glory
 and he said i will make all the light of my being come before you and will make clear to you what i am i will be kind to those to whom i will be kind and have mercy on those on whom i will have mercy
 but it is not possible for you to see my face for no man may see me and still go on living
 and the lord said see there is a place near me and you may take your place on the rock
 and when my glory goes by i will put you in a hole in the rock covering you with my hand till i have gone past
 then i will take away my hand and you will see my back but my face is not to be seen
 and the lord said to moses make two other stones like the first two and i will put on them the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you
 and be ready by the morning and come up on mount sinai and come before me there in the morning on the top of the mountain
 no one is to come up with you and let no man be seen anywhere on the mountain let no flocks or herds come near to get their food at its foot
 so moses got two stones cut like the first and early in the morning he went up mount sinai as the lord had said with the two stones in his hand
 and the lord came down in the cloud and took his place by the side of moses and moses gave worship to the name of the lord
 and the lord went past before his eyes saying the lord the lord a god full of pity and grace slow to wrath and great in mercy and faith
 having mercy on thousands overlooking evil and wrongdoing and sin he will not let wrongdoers go free but will send punishment on children for the sins of their fathers and on their childrens children to the third and fourth generation
 then moses quickly went down on his face in worship
 and he said if now i have grace in your eyes let the lord go among us for this is a stiff necked people and give us forgiveness for our wrongdoing and our sin and take us for your heritage
 and the lord said see this is what i will undertake before the eyes of your people i will do wonders such as have not been done in all the earth or in any nation and all your people will see the work of the lord for what i am about to do for you is greatly to be feared
 take care to do the orders which i give you today i will send out from before you the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
 but take care and do not make any agreement with the people of the land where you are going for it will be a cause of sin to you
 but their altars are to be overturned and their pillars broken and their images cut down
 for you are to be worshippers of no other god for the lord is a god who will not give his honour to another
 so see that you make no agreement with the people of the land and do not go after their gods or take part in their offerings or be guests at their feasts
 or take their daughters for your sons for when their daughters give worship before their gods they will make your sons take part with them
 make for yourselves no gods of metal
 keep the feast of unleavened bread for seven days your food is to be bread without leaven as i gave you orders at the regular time in the month abib for in that month you came out of egypt
 every first male child is mine the first male birth of your cattle the first male of every ox and sheep
 a lamb may be given in payment for the young of an ass but if you will not make payment for it its neck will have to be broken for all the first of your sons you are to make payment no one is to come before me without an offering
 six days let work be done but on the seventh day take your rest at ploughing time and at the grain cutting you are to have a day for rest
 and you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the first fruits of the grain and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields
 three times in the year let all your males come before the lord the god of israel
 for i will send out the nations before you and make wide the limits of your land and no man will make an attempt to take your land while you go up to give worship to the lord three times in the year
 no leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering and the offering of the passover feast may not be kept till the morning
 take the first fruits of your land as an offering to the house of the lord your god let not the young goat be cooked in its mothers milk
 and the lord said to moses put all these words in writing for on them is based the agreement which i will make with you
 and for forty days and forty nights moses was there with the lord and in that time he had no food or drink and he put in writing on the stones the words of the agreement the ten rules of the law
 now when moses came down from mount sinai with the two stones in his hand he was not conscious that his face was shining because of his talk with god
 but when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses and the shining of his face they would not come near him for fear
 then moses sent for them and aaron with the chiefs of the people came to him and moses had talk with them
 and later all the children of israel came near and he gave them all the orders which the lord had given him on mount sinai
 and at the end of his talk with them moses put a veil over his face
 but whenever moses went in before the lord to have talk with him he took off the veil till he came out and whenever he came out he said to the children of israel what he had been ordered to say
 and the children of israel saw that the face of moses was shining so moses put the veil over his face again till he went to the lord
 and moses sent for all the children of israel to come together and said to them this is what the lord has said and these are his orders
 six days let work be done but the seventh day is to be a holy day to you a sabbath of rest to the lord whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death
 no fire is to be lighted in any of your houses on the sabbath day
 and moses said to all the meeting of the children of israel this is the order which the lord has given
 take from among you an offering to the lord everyone who has the impulse in his heart let him give his offering to the lord gold and silver and brass
 and blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats hair
 and sheepskins coloured red and leather and hard wood
 and oil for the lights and spices for the holy oil and for the sweet perfumes for burning
 and beryls and jewels to be cut for the ephod and for the priests bag
 and let every wise hearted man among you come and make whatever has been ordered by the lord
 the house and its tent and its cover its hooks and its boards its rods and its pillars and its bases
 the ark with its cover and its rods and the veil hanging before it
 the table and its rods and all its vessels and the holy bread
 and the support for the lights with its vessels and its lights and the oil for the light
 and the altar for burning spices with its rods and the holy oil and the sweet perfume and the curtain for the door at the door of the house
 the altar of burned offerings with its network of brass its rods and all its vessels the washing vessel and its base
 the hangings for the open space its pillars and their bases and the curtain for the doorway
 the nails for the house and the nails for the open space and their cords
 the robes of needlework for the work of the holy place the holy robes for aaron the priest and the robes for his sons when acting as priests
 and all the children of israel went away from moses
 and everyone whose heart was moved everyone who was guided by the impulse of his spirit came with his offering for the lord for whatever was needed for the tent of meeting and its work and for the holy robes
 they came men and women all who were ready to give and gave pins and nose rings and finger rings and neck ornaments all of gold everyone gave an offering of gold to the lord
 and everyone who had blue and purple and red and the best linen and goats hair and sheepskins coloured red and leather gave them
 everyone who had silver and brass gave an offering of them to the lord and everyone who had hard wood such as was needed for the work gave it
 and all the women who were expert with their hands made cloth and gave the work of their hands blue and purple and red and the best linen
 and those women who had the knowledge made the goats hair into cloth
 and the rulers gave the beryls and the cut jewels for the ephod and the priests bag
 and the spice and the oil for the light and the holy oil and the sweet perfumes
 the children of israel every man and woman from the impulse of their hearts gave their offerings freely to the lord for the work which the lord had given moses orders to have done
 and moses said to the children of israel see the lord has made selection of bezalel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah
 and he has made him full of the spirit of god in all wisdom and knowledge and art of every sort
 as an expert designer of beautiful things working in gold and silver and brass
 trained in the cutting of stones and the ornamenting of wood and in every sort of handwork
 and he has given to him and to oholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan the power of training others
 to them he has given knowledge of all the arts of the handworker of the designer and the expert workman of the maker of needlework in blue and purple and red and the best linen and of the maker of cloth in all the arts of the designer and the trained workman they are expert
 so let bezalel and oholiab get to work with every wise hearted man to whom the lord has given wisdom and knowledge to do whatever is necessary for the ordering of the holy place as the lord has given orders
 then moses sent for bezalel and oholiab and for all the wise hearted men to whom the lord had given wisdom even everyone who was moved by the impulse of his heart to come and take part in the work
 and they took from moses all the offerings which the children of israel had given for the building of the holy place and still they went on giving him more free offerings every morning
 then the wise men who were doing all the work of the holy place came from their work
 and said to moses the people are giving much more than is needed for the work which the lord has given us orders to do
 so moses made an order and had it given out through all the tents saying let no man or woman make any more offerings for the holy place so the people were kept from giving more

 so all the work on the house of the tent of meeting was done as the lord had given orders to moses so the children of israel did it
 then they took the house to moses the tent with all the things for it its hooks its boards its rods its pillars and its bases

 the robes for use in the holy place and the holy robes for aaron and his sons when acting as priests
 the children of israel did everything as the lord had given orders to moses
 then moses when he saw all their work and saw that they had done everything as the lord had said gave them his blessing
 and moses answering said it is certain that they will not have faith in me or give ear to my voice for they will say you have not seen the lord
 and the lord said to him what is that in your hand and he said a rod
 and he said put it down on the earth and he put it down on the earth and it became a snake and moses went running from it
 and the lord said to moses put out your hand and take it by the tail  and he put out his hand and took a grip of it and it became a rod in his hand 
 so that they may be certain that the lord the god of their fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob has been seen by you
 then the lord said to him again put your hand inside your clothing and he put his hand inside his robe and when he took it out it was like the hand of a leper as white as snow
 and he said put your hand inside your robe again  and he put his hand into his robe again and when he took it out he saw that it had become like his other flesh 
 and if they do not have faith in you or give ear to the voice of the first sign they will have faith in the second sign
 and if they have no faith even in these two signs and will not give ear to your voice then you are to take the water of the nile and put it on the dry land and the water you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land
 and moses said to the lord o lord i am not a man of words i have never been so and am not now even after what you have said to your servant for talking is hard for me and i am slow of tongue
 and the lord said to him who has made mans mouth who takes away a mans voice or hearing or makes him seeing or blind is it not i the lord
 so go now and i will be with your mouth teaching you what to say
 and he said o lord send if you will by the hand of anyone whom it seems good to you to send
 and the lord was angry with moses and said is there not aaron your brother the levite to my knowledge he is good at talking and now he is coming out to you and when he sees you he will be glad in his heart
 let him give ear to your voice and you will put my words in his mouth and i will be with your mouth and with his teaching you what you have to do
 and he will do the talking for you to the people he will be to you as a mouth and you will be to him as god
 and take in your hand this rod with which you will do the signs
 and moses went back to jethro his father in law and said to him let me go back now to my relations in egypt and see if they are still living and jethro said to moses go in peace
 and the lord said to moses in midian go back to egypt for all the men are dead who were attempting to take your life
 and moses took his wife and his sons and put them on an ass and went back to the land of egypt and he took the rod of god in his hand
 and the lord said to moses when you go back to egypt see that you do before pharaoh all the wonders which i have given you power to do but i will make his heart hard and he will not let the people go
 and you are to say to pharaoh the lord says israel is the first of my sons
 and i said to you let my son go so that he may give me worship and you did not let him go so now i will put the first of your sons to death
 now on the journey at the nights resting place the lord came in his way and would have put him to death
 then zipporah took a sharp stone and cutting off the skin of her sons private parts and touching his feet with it she said truly you are a husband of blood to me
 so he let him go then she said you are a husband of blood because of the circumcision
 and the lord said to aaron go into the waste land and you will see moses so he went and came across moses at the mountain of god and gave him a kiss
 and moses gave aaron an account of all the words of the lord which he had sent him to say and of all the signs which he had given him orders to do
 then moses and aaron went and got together all the chiefs of the children of israel
 and aaron said to them all the words the lord had said to moses and did the signs before all the people
 and the people had faith in them and hearing that the lord had taken up the cause of the children of israel and had seen their troubles with bent heads they gave him worship
 and the lord said to moses
 on the first day of the first month you are to put up the house of the tent of meeting
 and inside it put the ark of the law hanging the veil before it
 and put the table inside placing all the things on it in order and put in the support for the lights and let its lights be burning
 and put the gold altar for burning perfumes in front of the ark of the law hanging the curtain over the doorway of the house
 and put the altar of burned offerings before the doorway of the house of the tent of meeting
 and let the washing vessel with water in it be put between the tent of meeting and the altar
 and put up the hangings forming the open space all round it with the curtain over its doorway
 and take the holy oil and put it on the house and everything in it and make it and everything in it holy
 and put oil on the altar of burned offering and make it and all its vessels holy this altar is to be most holy
 and put oil on the washing vessel and its base and make them holy
 then let aaron and his sons come to the door of the tent of meeting and after washing them with water
 you are to put on aaron the holy robes and you are to put oil on him and make him holy so that he may be my priest
 and take his sons with him and put coats on them
 and put oil on them as you did on their father so that they may be my priests the putting on of oil will make them priests for ever from generation to generation
 and moses did this as the lord gave him orders so he did
 so on the first day of the first month in the second year the house was put up
 moses put up the house placing its bases in position and lifting up its uprights putting in the rods and planting the pillars in their places
 stretching the outer tent over it and covering it as the lord had given him orders
 and he took the law and put it inside the ark and put the rods at its side and the cover over it
 and he took the ark into the house hanging up the veil before it as the lord had given him orders
 and he put the table in the tent of meeting on the north side outside the veil
 and he put the bread on it in order before the lord as the lord had said
 the support for the lights he put in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side
 lighting the lights before the lord as the lord had given him orders
 and he put the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil
 burning sweet perfumes on it as the lord had given him orders
 and he put up the curtain at the doorway of the house
 and at the door of the house of the tent of meeting he put the altar of burned offerings offering on it the burned offering and the meal offering as the lord had given him orders
 and between the altar and the tent of meeting he put the vessel with water in it for washing
 in it the hands and feet of moses and aaron and his sons were washed
 whenever they went into the tent of meeting and when they came near the altar as the lord had given orders to moses
 and he put up the hangings forming the open space round the house and the altar and put the curtain over the doorway so moses made the work complete
 then the cloud came down covering the tent of meeting and the house was full of the glory of the lord
 so that moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting because the cloud was resting on it and the house was full of the glory of the lord
 and whenever the cloud was taken up from the house the children of israel went forward on their journey
 but while the cloud was there they made no move till it was taken up
 for the cloud of the lord was resting on the house by day and at night there was fire in the cloud before the eyes of all the people of israel and so it was through all their journeys
 and after that moses and aaron came to pharaoh and said the lord the god of israel says let my people go so that they may keep a feast to me in the waste land
 and pharaoh said who is the lord to whose voice i am to give ear and let israel go i have no knowledge of the lord and i will not let israel go
 and they said the god of the hebrews has come to us let us then go three days journey into the waste land to make an offering to the lord our god so that he may not send death on us by disease or the sword
 and the king of egypt said to them why do you moses and aaron take the people away from their work get back to your work
 and pharaoh said truly the people of the land are increasing in number and you are keeping them back from their work
 the same day pharaoh gave orders to the overseers and those who were responsible for the work saying
 give these men no more dry stems for their brick making as you have been doing let them go and get the material for themselves
 but see that they make the same number of bricks as before and no less for they have no love for work and so they are crying out and saying let us go and make an offering to our god
 give the men harder work and see that they do it let them not give attention to false words
 and the overseers of the people and their responsible men went out and said to the people pharaoh says i will give you no more dry stems
 go yourselves and get dry stems wherever you are able for your work is not to be any less
 so the people were sent in all directions through the land of egypt to get dry grass for stems
 and the overseers went on driving them and saying do your full days work as before when there were dry stems for you
 and the responsible men of the children of israel whom pharaohs overseers had put over them were given blows and they said to them why have you not done your regular work in making bricks as before
 then the responsible men of the children of israel came to pharaoh protesting and saying why are you acting in this way to your servants
 they give us no dry stems and they say to us make bricks and they give your servants blows but it is your people who are in the wrong
 but he said you have no love for work that is why you say let us go and make an offering to the lord
 go now get back to your work no dry stems will be given to you but you are to make the full number of bricks
 then the responsible men of the children of israel saw that they were purposing evil when they said the number of bricks which you have to make every day will be no less than before
 and they came face to face with moses and aaron who were in their way when they came out from pharaoh
 and they said to them may the lord take note of you and be your judge for you have given pharaoh and his servants a bad opinion of us putting a sword in their hands for our destruction
 and moses went back to the lord and said lord why have you done evil to this people why have you sent me
 for from the time when i came to pharaoh to put your words before him he has done evil to this people and you have given them no help
 and the lord said to moses now you will see what i am about to do to pharaoh for by a strong hand he will be forced to let them go driving them out of his land because of my outstretched arm
 and god said to moses i am yahweh
 i let myself be seen by abraham isaac and jacob as god the ruler of all but they had no knowledge of my name yahweh
 and i made an agreement with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their wanderings
 and truly my ears are open to the cry of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep under their yoke and i have kept in mind my agreement
 say then to the children of israel i am yahweh and i will take you out from under the yoke of the egyptians and make you safe from their power and will make you free by the strength of my arm after great punishments
 and i will take you to be my people and i will be your god and you will be certain that i am the lord your god who takes you out from under the yoke of the egyptians
 and i will be your guide into the land which i made an oath to give to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it to you for your heritage i am yahweh
 and moses said these words to the children of israel but they gave no attention to him because of the grief of their spirit and the cruel weight of their work
 and the lord said to moses
 go in and say to pharaoh king of egypt that he is to let the children of israel go out of his land
 and moses answering the lord said see the children of israel will not give ear to me how then will pharaoh give ear to me whose lips are unclean
 and the word of the lord came to moses and aaron with orders for the children of israel and for pharaoh king of egypt to take the children of israel out of the land of egypt
 these are the heads of their fathers families the sons of reuben the oldest son of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these are the families of reuben
 and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a woman of canaan these are the families of simeon

 and eleazar aarons son took as his wife one of the daughters of putiel and she gave birth to phinehas these are the heads of the families of the levites in the order of their families
 these are the same aaron and moses to whom the lord said take the children of israel out of the land of egypt in their armies
 these are the men who gave orders to pharaoh to let the children of israel go out of egypt these are the same moses and aaron
 and on the day when the word of the lord came to moses in the land of egypt
 the lord said to moses i am the lord say to pharaoh king of egypt everything i am saying to you
 and moses said to the lord my lips are unclean how is it possible that pharaoh will give me a hearing
 and the lord said to moses see i have made you a god to pharaoh and aaron your brother will be your prophet
 say whatever i give you orders to say and aaron your brother will give word to pharaoh to let the children of israel go out of his land
 and i will make pharaohs heart hard and my signs and wonders will be increased in the land of egypt
 but pharaoh will not give ear to you and i will put my hand on egypt and take my armies my people the children of israel out of egypt after great punishments
 and the egyptians will see that i am the lord when my hand is stretched out over egypt and i take the children of israel out from among them
 and moses and aaron did so as the lord gave them orders so they did
 and moses was eighty years old and aaron eighty three years old when they gave the lords word to pharaoh
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 if pharaoh says to you let me see a wonder then say to aaron take your rod and put it down on the earth before pharaoh so that it may become a snake
 then moses and aaron went in to pharaoh and they did as the lord had said and aaron put his rod down on the earth before pharaoh and his servants and it became a snake
 then pharaoh sent for the wise men and the wonder workers and they the wonder workers of egypt did the same with their secret arts
 for every one of them put down his rod on the earth and they became snakes but aarons rod made a meal of their rods
 but pharaohs heart was made hard and he did not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses and aaron pharaohs heart is unchanged he will not let the people go
 go to pharaoh in the morning when he goes out to the water you will be waiting for him by the edge of the nile with the rod which was turned into a snake in your hand
 and say to him the lord the god of the hebrews has sent me to you saying let my people go so that they may give me worship in the waste land but up to now you have not given ear to his words
 so the lord says by this you may be certain that i am the lord see by the touch of this rod in my hand the waters of the nile will be turned to blood
 and the fish in the nile will come to destruction and the river will send up a bad smell and the egyptians will not be able for disgust to make use of the water of the nile for drinking
 and the lord said say to aaron let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the waters of egypt and over the rivers and the streams and the pools and over every stretch of water so that they may be turned to blood and there will be blood through all the land of egypt in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone
 and moses and aaron did as the lord had said and when his rod had been lifted up and stretched out over the waters of the nile before the eyes of pharaoh and his servants all the water in the nile was turned to blood
 and the fish in the nile came to destruction and a bad smell went up from the river and the egyptians were not able to make use of the water of the nile for drinking and there was blood through all the land of egypt
 and the wonder workers of egypt did the same with their secret arts but pharaohs heart was made hard and he would not give ear to them as the lord had said
 then pharaoh went into his house and did not take even this to heart
 and all the egyptians made holes round about the nile to get drinking water for they were not able to make use of the nile water
 and seven days went past after the lord had put his hand on the nile
 and this is what the lord said to moses go to pharaoh and say to him the lord says let my people go so that they may give me worship
 and if you will not let them go see i will send frogs into every part of your land
 the nile will be full of frogs and they will come up into your house and into your bedrooms and on your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people and into your ovens and into your bread basins
 the frogs will come up over you and your people and all your servants
 and the lord said to moses say to aaron let the rod in your hand be stretched out over the streams and the waterways and the pools causing frogs to come up on the land of egypt
 and when aaron put out his hand over the waters of egypt the frogs came up and all the land of egypt was covered with them
 and the wonder workers did the same with their secret arts making frogs come up over the land of egypt
 then pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and said make prayer to the lord that he will take away these frogs from me and my people and i will let the people go and make their offering to the lord
 and moses said i will let you have the honour of saying when i am to make prayer for you and your servants and your people that the frogs may be sent away from you and your houses and be only in the nile
 and he said by tomorrow and he said let it be as you say so that you may see that there is no other like the lord our god
 and the frogs will be gone from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people and will be only in the nile
 then moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses made prayer to the lord about the frogs which he had sent on pharaoh
 and the lord did as moses said and there was an end of all the frogs in the houses and in the open spaces and in the fields
 and they put them together in masses and a bad smell went up from the land
 but when pharaoh saw that there was peace for a time he made his heart hard and did not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses say to aaron let your rod be stretched out over the dust of the earth so that it may become insects through all the land of egypt
 and they did so and aaron stretching out the rod in his hand gave a touch to the dust of the earth and insects came on man and on beast all the dust of the earth was changed into insects through all the land of egypt
 and the wonder workers with their secret arts attempting to make insects were unable to do so and there were insects on man and on beast
 then the wonder workers said to pharaoh this is the finger of god but pharaohs heart was hard and he did not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses get up early in the morning and take your place before pharaoh when he comes out to the water and say to him this is what the lord says let my people go to give me worship
 for if you do not let my people go see i will send clouds of flies on you and on your servants and on your people and into their houses and the houses of the egyptians and the land where they are will be full of flies
 and at that time i will make a division between your land and the land of goshen where my people are and no flies will be there so that you may see that i am the lord over all the earth
 and i will put a division between my people and your people tomorrow this sign will be seen
 and the lord did so and great clouds of flies came into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and all the land of egypt was made waste because of the flies
 and pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and said go and make your offering to your god here in the land
 and moses said it is not right to do so for we make our offerings of that to which the egyptians give worship and if we do so before their eyes certainly we will be stoned
 but we will go three days journey into the waste land and make an offering to the lord our god as he may give us orders
 then pharaoh said i will let you go to make an offering to the lord your god in the waste land but do not go very far away and make prayer for me
 and moses said when i go out from you i will make prayer to the lord that the cloud of flies may go away from pharaoh and from his people and from his servants tomorrow only let pharaoh no longer by deceit keep back the people from making their offering to the lord
 then moses went out from pharaoh and made prayer to the lord
 and the lord did as moses said and took away the cloud of flies from pharaoh and from his servants and from his people not one was to be seen
 but again pharaoh made his heart hard and did not let the people go
 then the lord said to moses go in to pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may give me worship
 for if you will not let them go but still keep them in your power
 then the hand of the lord will put on your cattle in the field on the horses and the asses and the camels on the herds and the flocks a very evil disease
 and the lord will make a division between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt there will be no loss of any of the cattle of israel
 and the time was fixed by the lord and he said tomorrow the lord will do this thing in the land
 and on the day after the lord did as he had said causing the death of all the cattle of egypt but there was no loss of any of the cattle of israel
 and pharaoh sent and got word that there was no loss of any of the cattle of israel but the heart of pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go
 and the lord said to moses and to aaron take in your hand a little dust from the fire and let moses send it in a shower up to heaven before the eyes of pharaoh
 and it will become small dust over all the land of egypt and will be a skin disease bursting out in wounds on man and beast through all the land of egypt
 so they took some dust from the fire and placing themselves before pharaoh moses sent it out in a shower up to heaven and it became a skin disease bursting out on man and on beast
 and the wonder workers were not able to take their places before moses because of the disease for the disease was on the wonder workers and on all the egyptians
 and the lord made pharaohs heart hard and he would not give ear to them as the lord had said
 and the lord said to moses get up early in the morning and take your place before pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may give me worship
 for this time i will send all my punishments on yourself and on your servants and on your people so that you may see that there is no other like me in all the earth
 for if i had put the full weight of my hand on you and your people you would have been cut off from the earth
 but for this very reason i have kept you from destruction to make clear to you my power and so that my name may be honoured through all the earth
 are you still uplifted in pride against my people so that you will not let them go
 truly tomorrow about this time i will send down an ice storm such as never was in egypt from its earliest days till now
 then send quickly and get in your cattle and all you have from the fields for if any man or beast in the field has not been put under cover the ice storm will come down on them with destruction
 then everyone among the servants of pharaoh who had the fear of the lord made his servants and his cattle come quickly into the house
 and he who gave no attention to the word of the lord kept his servants and his cattle in the field
 and the lord said to moses now let your hand be stretched out to heaven so that there may be an ice storm on all the land of egypt on man and on beast and on every plant of the field through all the land of egypt
 and moses put out his rod to heaven and the lord sent thunder and an ice storm and fire running down on the earth the lord sent an ice storm on the land of egypt
 so there was an ice storm with fire running through it coming down with great force such as never was in all the land of egypt from the time when it became a nation
 and through all the land of egypt the ice storm came down on everything which was in the fields on man and on beast and every green plant was crushed and every tree of the field broken
 only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were there was no ice storm
 then pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and said to them i have done evil this time the lord is upright and i and my people are sinners
 make prayer to the lord for there has been enough of these thunderings of god and this ice storm and i will let you go and will keep you no longer
 and moses said when i am gone outside the town my hands will be stretched out to the lord the thunders and the ice storm will come to an end so that you may see that the earth is the lords
 but as for you and your servants i am certain that even now the fear of the lord god will not be in your hearts
 and the flax and the barley were damaged for the barley was almost ready to be cut and the flax was in flower
 but the rest of the grain plants were undamaged for they had not come up
 so moses went out of the town and stretching out his hands made prayer to god and the thunders and the ice storm came to an end and the fall of rain was stopped
 but when pharaoh saw that the rain and the ice storm and the thunders were ended he went on sinning and made his heart hard he and his servants
 and the heart of pharaoh was hard and he did not let the people go as the lord had said by the mouth of moses
 now it came about in the thirtieth year in the fourth month on the fifth day of the month while i was by the river chebar among those who had been made prisoners that the heavens were made open and i saw visions of god
 on the fifth day of the month in the fifth year after king jehoiachin had been made a prisoner
 the word of the lord came to me ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldaeans by the river chebar and the hand of the lord was on me there
 and looking i saw a storm wind coming out of the north a great cloud with flames of fire coming after one another and a bright light shining round about it and in the heart of it was something coloured like electrum
 and in the heart of it were the forms of four living beings and this was what they were like they had the form of a man
 and every one had four faces and every one of them had four wings
 and their feet were straight feet and the under sides of their feet were like the feet of oxen and they were shining like polished brass
 and they had the hands of a man under their wings the four of them had faces on their four sides
 they went without turning every one went straight forward
 as for the form of their faces they had the face of a man and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right side and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side and the four of them had the face of an eagle
 and their wings were separate at the top two of the wings of every one were joined one to another and two were covering their bodies
 every one of them went straight forward wherever the spirit was to go they went they went on without turning
 and between the living beings it was like burning coals of fire as if flames were going one after the other between the living beings and the fire was bright and out of the fire went thunder flames
 and the living beings went out and came back as quickly as a thunder flame
 now while i was looking at the four living beings i saw one wheel on the earth by the side of the living beings for the four of them
 the form of the wheels and their work was like a beryl the four of them had the same form and design and they were like a wheel inside a wheel
 the four of them went straight forward without turning to one side
 and i saw that they had edges and their edges even of the four were full of eyes round about
 and when the living beings went on the wheels went by their side and when the living beings were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up
 wherever the spirit was to go they went and the wheels were lifted up by their side for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels
 when these went on the others went and when these came to rest the others came to rest and when these were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up by their side for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels
 and over the heads of the living beings there was the form of an arch looking like ice stretched out over their heads on high
 under the arch their wings were straight one stretched out to another every one had two wings covering their bodies on this side and two covering their bodies on that side
 and when they went the sound of their wings was like the sound of great waters to my ears like the voice of the ruler of all a sound like the rushing of an army when they came to rest they let down their wings
 and there was a voice from the top of the arch which was over their heads when they came to rest they let down their wings
 and on the top of the arch which was over their heads was the form of a kings seat like a sapphire stone and on the form of the seat was the form of a man seated on it on high
 and i saw it coloured like electrum with the look of fire in it and round it going up from what seemed to be the middle of his body and going down from what seemed to be the middle of his body i saw what was like fire and there was a bright light shining round him
 like the bow in the cloud on a day of rain so was the light shining round him and this is what the glory of the lord was like and when i saw it i went down on my face and the voice of one talking came to my ears
 then looking i saw that on the arch which was over the head of the winged ones there was seen over them what seemed like a sapphire stone having the form of a kings seat
 and he said to the man clothed in linen go in between the wheels under the winged ones and get your two hands full of burning coals from between the winged ones and send them in a shower over the town and he went in before my eyes
 now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in and the inner square was full of the cloud
 and the glory of the lord went up from the winged ones and came to rest over the doorstep of the house and the house was full of the cloud and the open square was full of the shining of the lords glory
 and the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square like the voice of the ruler of all
 and when he gave orders to the man clothed in linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between the winged ones then he went in and took his place at the side of a wheel
 and stretching out his hand to the fire which was between the winged ones he took some of it and went out
 and i saw the form of a mans hands among the winged ones under their wings
 and looking i saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye
 in form the four of them were all the same they seemed like a wheel inside a wheel
 when they were moving they went on their four sides without turning they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking they went without turning
 and the edges of the four wheels were full of eyes round about
 as for the wheels they were named in my hearing the circling wheels
 and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a winged one and the second was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle
 and the winged ones went up on high this is the living being which i saw by the river chebar
 and when the winged ones went the wheels went by their side and when their wings were lifted to take them up from the earth the wheels were not turned from their side
 when they were at rest in their place these were at rest when they were lifted up these went up with them for the spirit of life was in them
 then the glory of the lord went out from the doorstep of the house and came to rest over the winged ones
 and the winged ones lifting up their wings went up from the earth before my eyes with the wheels by their side and they came to rest at the east doorway of the lords house and the glory of the god of israel was over them on high
 this is the living being which i saw under the god of israel by the river chebar and it was clear to me that they were the winged ones
 every one had four faces and every one had four wings and hands like a mans hands were under their wings
 as for the form of their faces they were the faces whose form i saw by the river chebar when they went every one of them went straight forward
 and the wind lifting me up took me to the east doorway of the lords house looking to the east and at the door i saw twenty five men and among them i saw jaazaniah the son of azzur and pelatiah the son of benaiah rulers of the people
 then he said to me son of man these are the men who are designing evil who are teaching evil ways in this town
 who say this is not the time for building houses this town is the cooking pot and we are the flesh
 for this cause be a prophet against them be a prophet o son of man
 and the spirit of the lord came on me and he said to me say these are the words of the lord this is what you have said o children of israel what comes into your mind is clear to me
 you have made great the number of your dead in this town you have made its streets full of dead men
 for this reason the lord has said your dead whom you have put down in its streets they are the flesh and this town is the cooking pot but i will make you come out from inside it
 you have been fearing the sword and i will send the sword on you says the lord
 i will make you come out from inside the town and will give you up into the hands of men from other lands and will be judge among you
 you will come to your death by the sword and i will be your judge in the land of israel and you will be certain that i am the lord
 this town will not be your cooking pot and you will not be the flesh inside it i will be your judge at the limit of the land of israel
 and you will be certain that i am the lord for you have not been guided by my rules or given effect to my orders but you have been living by the orders of the nations round about you
 now while i was saying these things death came to pelatiah the son of benaiah then falling down on my face and crying out with a loud voice i said ah lord  will you put an end to all the rest of israel
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man your countrymen your relations and all the children of israel all of them are those to whom the people of jerusalem have said go far from the lord this land is given to us for a heritage
 for this reason say this is what the lord has said though i have had them moved far off among the nations and though i have sent them wandering among the countries still i have been a safe place for them for a little time in the countries where they have come
 then say this is what the lord has said i will get you together from the peoples and make you come out of the countries where you have been sent in flight and i will give you the land of israel
 and they will come there and take away all the hated and disgusting things from it
 and i will give them a new heart and i will put a new spirit in them and i will take the heart of stone out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh
 so that they may be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them and they will be to me a people and i will be to them a god
 but as for those whose heart goes after their hated and disgusting things i will send on their heads the punishment of their ways says the lord
 then the wings of the winged ones were lifted up and the wheels were by their side and the glory of the god of israel was over them on high
 and the glory of the lord went up from inside the town and came to rest on the mountain on the east side of the town
 and the wind lifting me up took me in the visions of god into chaldaea to those who had been taken away as prisoners so the vision which i had seen went away from me
 then i gave an account to those who had been taken prisoners of all the things which the lord had made me see
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man you are living among an uncontrolled people who have eyes to see but see not and ears for hearing but they do not give ear for they are an uncontrolled people
 and you o son of man by day before their eyes get ready the vessels of one who is taken away and go away from your place to another place before their eyes it may be that they will see though they are an uncontrolled people
 by day before their eyes take out your vessels like those of one who is taken away and go out in the evening before their eyes like those who are taken away as prisoners
 make a hole in the wall before their eyes and go out through it
 and before their eyes take your goods on your back and go out in the dark go with your face covered for i have made you a sign to the children of israel
 and i did as i was ordered i took out my vessels by day like those of one who is taken away and in the evening i made a hole through the wall with a tent pin and in the dark i went out taking my things on my back before their eyes
 and in the morning the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man has not israel the uncontrolled people said to you what are you doing
 you are to say to them this is what the lord has said this word has to do with the ruler in jerusalem and all the children of israel in it
 say i am your sign as i have done so will it be done to them they will go away as prisoners
 and the ruler who is among them will take his goods on his back in the dark and go out he will make a hole in the wall through which to go out he will have his face covered so that he may not be seen
 and my net will be stretched out on him and he will be taken in my cords and i will take him to babylon to the land of the chaldaeans but he will not see it and there death will come to him
 and all his helpers round about him and all his armies i will send in flight to every wind and i will let loose a sword after them
 and they will be certain that i am the lord when i send them in flight among the nations driving them out through the countries
 but a small number of them i will keep from the sword from the need of food and from disease so that they may make clear all their disgusting ways among the nations where they come and they will be certain that i am the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man take your food with shaking fear and your water with trouble and care
 and say to the people of the land this is what the lord has said about the people of jerusalem and the land of israel they will take their food with care and their drink with wonder so that all the wealth of their land may be taken from it because of the violent ways of the people living in it
 and the peopled towns will be made waste and the land will become a wonder and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man what is this saying which you have about the land of israel the time is long and every vision comes to nothing
 for this cause say to them this is what the lord has said i have made this saying come to an end and it will no longer be used as a common saying in israel but say to them the days are near and the effect of every vision
 for there will be no more false visions or smooth use of secret arts in israel
 for i am the lord i will say the word and what i say i will do it will not be put off for in your days o uncontrolled people i will say the word and do it says the lord
 again the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man see the children of israel say the vision which he sees is for the days which are a long way off and his words are of times still far away
 say to them then this is what the lord has said not one of my words will be put off any longer but what i say i will do says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man be a prophet against the prophets of israel and say to those prophets whose words are the invention of their hearts give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said a curse on the foolish prophets who go after the spirit which is in them and have seen nothing 
 o israel your prophets have been like jackals in the waste places
 you have not gone up into the broken places or made up the wall for the children of israel to take your place in the fight in the day of the lord
 they have seen visions without substance and made use of secret arts who say the lord has said and the lord has not sent them hoping that the word would have effect
 have you not seen a vision without substance and have you not falsely made use of secret arts when you say the lord has said though i have said nothing
 so this is what the lord has said because your words are without substance and your visions are false see i am against you says the lord
 and my hand will be against the prophets who see visions without substance and who make false use of secret arts they will not be in the secret of my people and they will not be recorded in the list of the children of israel and they will not come into the land of israel and it will be clear to you that i am the lord
 because even because they have been guiding my people into error saying peace when there is no peace and in the building of a division wall they put whitewash on it
 say to those who put whitewash on it there will be an overflowing shower and you o ice drops will come raining down and it will be broken in two by the storm wind
 and when the wall has come down will they not say to you where is the whitewash which you put on it
 for this reason the lord has said i will have it broken in two by a storm wind in my passion and there will be an overflowing shower in my wrath and you o ice drops will come raining angrily down
 so i will let the wall which you were covering with whitewash be broken down i will have it levelled to the earth so that its base is uncovered it will come down and destruction will come on you with it and it will be clear to you that i am the lord
 so i will let loose my passion on the wall in full measure and on those who put whitewash on it and i will say to you where is the wall and where are those who put whitewash on it
 even the prophets of israel who say words to jerusalem who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace says the lord
 and you son of man let your face be turned against the daughters of your people who are acting the part of prophets at their pleasure be a prophet against them and say
 this is what the lord has said a curse is on the women who are stitching bands on all arms and putting veils on the heads of those of every size so that they may go after souls  will you go after the souls of my people and keep yourselves safe from death
 and you have put me to shame among my people for a little barley and some bits of bread sending death on souls for whom there is no cause of death and keeping those souls living who have no right to life by the false words you say to my people who give ear to what is false
 for this cause the lord has said see i am against your bands with which you go after souls and i will violently take them off their arms and i will let loose the souls even the souls whom you go after freely
 and i will have your veils violently parted in two and will make my people free from your hands and they will no longer be in your power for you to go after them and you will be certain that i am the lord
 because with your false words you have given pain to the heart of the upright man when i had not made him sad in order to make strong the hands of the evil doer so that he may not be turned from his evil way and get life
 for this cause you will see no more foolish visions or make false use of secret arts and i will make my people free from your power and you will be certain that i am the lord
 then certain of the responsible men of israel came to me and took their seats before me
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man these men have taken their false gods into their hearts and put before their faces the sin which is the cause of their fall am i to give ear when they come to me for directions
 for this cause say to them these are the words of the lord every man of israel who has taken his false god into his heart and put before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall and comes to the prophet i the lord will give him an answer by myself in agreement with the number of his false gods
 so as to take the children of israel in the thoughts of their hearts because they have become strange to me through their false gods
 for this cause say to the children of israel these are the words of the lord come back and give up your false gods and let your faces be turned from your disgusting things
 when any one of the men of israel or of those from other lands who are living in israel who has become strange to me and takes his false gods into his heart and puts before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall comes to the prophet to get directions from me i the lord will give him an answer by myself
 and my face will be turned against that man and i will make him a sign and a common saying cutting him off from among my people and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and if the prophet tricked by deceit says anything it is i the lord by whom he has been tricked and i will put out my hand against him and he will be cut off from among my people israel
 and the punishment of their sin will be on them the sin of the prophet will be the same as the sin of him who goes to him for directions
 so that the children of israel may no longer go wandering away from me or make themselves unclean with all their wrongdoing but they will be my people and i will be their god says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man when a land sinning against me does wrong and my hand is stretched out against it and the support of its bread is broken and i make it short of food cutting off man and beast from it
 even if these three men noah daniel and job were in it only themselves would they keep safe by their righteousness says the lord
 or if i send evil beasts through the land causing destruction and making it waste so that no man may go through because of the beasts
 even if these three men were in it by my life says the lord they would not keep safe their sons or daughters but only themselves and the land would be made waste
 or if i send a sword against that land and say sword go through the land cutting off from it man and beast
 even if these three men were in it by my life says the lord they would not keep safe their sons or daughters but only themselves
 or if i send disease into that land letting loose my wrath on it in blood cutting off from it man and beast
 even if noah daniel and job were in it by my life says the lord they would not keep son or daughter safe only themselves would they keep safe through their righteousness
 for this is what the lord has said how much more when i send my four bitter punishments on jerusalem the sword and need of food and evil beasts and disease cutting off from it man and beast
 but truly there will still be a small band who will be safe even sons and daughters and they will come out to you and you will see their ways and their doings and you will be comforted about the evil which i have sent on jerusalem even about everything i have sent on it
 they will give you comfort when you see their ways and their doings and you will be certain that not for nothing have i done all the things i have done in it says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man what is the vine tree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods
 will its wood be used for any work do men make of it a pin for hanging any vessel on
 see it is put into the fire for burning the fire has made a meal of its two ends and the middle part of it is burned is it good for any work
 truly before it was cut down it was not used for any purpose how much less when the fire has made a meal of it and it is burned will it be made into anything
 for this cause the lord has said like the vine tree among the trees of the woods which i have given to the fire for burning so will i give the people of jerusalem
 and my face will be turned against them and though they have come out of the fire they will be burned up by it and it will be clear to you that i am the lord when my face is turned against them
 and i will make the land a waste because they have done evil says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man make clear to jerusalem her disgusting ways
 and say this is what the lord has said to jerusalem your start and your birth was from the land of the canaanite an amorite was your father and your mother was a hittite
 as for your birth on the day of your birth your cord was not cut and you were not washed in water to make you clean you were not salted or folded in linen bands
 no eye had pity on you to do any of these things to you or to be kind to you but you were put out into the open country because your life was hated at the time of your birth
 and when i went past you and saw you stretched out in your blood i said to you though you are stretched out in your blood have life
 and be increased in number like the buds of the field and you were increased and became great and you came to the time of love your breasts were formed and your hair was long but you were uncovered and without clothing
 now when i went past you looking at you i saw that your time was the time of love and i put my skirts over you covering your unclothed body and i gave you my oath and made an agreement with you says the lord and you became mine
 then i had you washed with water washing away all your blood and rubbing you with oil
 and i had you clothed with needlework and put leather shoes on your feet folding fair linen about you and covering you with silk
 and i made you fair with ornaments and put jewels on your hands and a chain on your neck
 and i put a ring in your nose and ear rings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head
 so you were made beautiful with gold and silver and your clothing was of the best linen and silk and needlework your food was the best meal and honey and oil and you were very beautiful
 you were so beautiful that the story of you went out into all nations you were completely beautiful because of my glory which i had put on you says the lord
 but you put your faith in the fact that you were beautiful acting like a loose woman because you were widely talked of and offering your cheap love to everyone who went by whoever it might be
 and you took your robes and made high places for yourself ornamented with every colour acting like a loose woman on them without shame or fear
 and you took the fair jewels my silver and gold which i had given to you and made for yourself male images acting like a loose woman with them
 and you took your robes of needlework for their clothing and put my oil and my perfume before them
 and my bread which i gave you the best meal and oil and honey which i gave you for your food you put it before them for a sweet smell says the lord
 and you took your sons and your daughters whom i had by you offering even these to them to be their food was your loose behaviour so small a thing
 that you put my children to death and gave them up to go through the fire to them
 and in all your disgusting and false behaviour you had no memory of your early days when you were uncovered and without clothing stretched out in your blood
 and it came about after all your evil doing says the lord
 that you made for yourself an arched room in every open place
 you put up your high places at the top of every street and made the grace of your form a disgusting thing opening your feet to everyone who went by increasing your loose ways
 and you went with the egyptians your neighbours great of flesh increasing your loose ways moving me to wrath
 now then my hand is stretched out against you cutting down your fixed amount and i have given you up to the desire of your haters the daughters of the philistines who are shamed by your loose ways
 and you went with the assyrians because of your desire which was without measure you were acting like a loose woman with them and still you had not enough
 and you went on in your loose ways even as far as the land of chaldaea and still you had not enough
 how feeble is your heart says the lord seeing that you do all these things the work of a loose and overruling woman
 for you have made your arched room at the top of every street and your high place in every open place though you were not like a loose woman in getting together your payment
 the untrue wife who takes strange lovers in place of her husband 
 they give payment to all loose women but you give rewards to your lovers offering them payment so that they may come to you on every side for your cheap love
 and in your loose behaviour you are different from other women for no one goes after you to make love to you and because you give payment and no payment is given to you in this you are different from them
 for this cause o loose woman give ear to the voice of the lord
 this is what the lord has said because your unclean behaviour was let loose and your body uncovered in your loose ways with your lovers and with your disgusting images and for the blood of your children which you gave to them
 for this cause i will get together all your lovers with whom you have taken your pleasure and all those to whom you have given your love with all those who were hated by you i will even make them come together against you on every side and i will have you uncovered before them so that they may see your shame
 and you will be judged by me as women are judged who have been untrue to their husbands and have taken life and i will let loose against you passion and bitter feeling
 i will give you into their hands and your arched room will be overturned and your high places broken down they will take your clothing off you and take away your fair jewels and when they have done you will be uncovered and shamed
 and they will get together a meeting against you stoning you with stones and wounding you with their swords
 and they will have you burned with fire sending punishments on you before the eyes of great numbers of women and i will put an end to your loose ways and you will no longer give payment
 and the heat of my wrath against you will have an end and my bitter feeling will be turned away from you and i will be quiet and will be angry no longer
 because you have not kept in mind the days when you were young but have been troubling me with all these things for this reason i will make the punishment of your ways come on your head says the lord because you have done this evil thing in addition to all your disgusting acts
 see in every common saying about you it will be said as the mother is so is her daughter
 you are the daughter of your mother whose soul is turned in disgust from her husband and her children and you are the sister of your sisters who were turned in disgust from their husbands and their children your mother was a hittite and your father an amorite
 your older sister is samaria living at your left hand she and her daughters and your younger sister living at your right hand is sodom and her daughters
 still you have not gone in their ways or done the disgusting things which they have done but as if that was only a little thing you have gone deeper in evil than they in all your ways
 by my life says the lord sodom your sister never did she or her daughters what you and your daughters have done
 truly this was the sin of your sister sodom pride a full measure of food and the comforts of wealth in peace were seen in her and her daughters and she gave no help to the poor or to those in need
 they were full of pride and did what was disgusting to me and so i took them away as you have seen
 and samaria has not done half your sins but you have made the number of your disgusting acts greater than theirs making your sisters seem more upright than you by all the disgusting things which you have done
 and you yourself will be put to shame in that you have given the decision for your sisters through your sins which are more disgusting than theirs they are more upright than you truly you will be shamed and made low for you have made your sisters seem upright
 and i will let their fate be changed the fate of sodom and her daughters and the fate of samaria and her daughters and your fate with theirs
 so that you will be shamed and made low because of all you have done when i have mercy on you
 and your sisters sodom and her daughters will go back to their first condition and samaria and her daughters will go back to their first condition and you and your daughters will go back to your first condition
 was not your sister sodom an oath in your mouth in the day of your pride
 before your shame was uncovered now you have become like her a word of shame to the daughters of edom and all who are round about you the daughters of the philistines who put shame on you round about
 the reward of your evil designs and your disgusting ways has come on you says the lord
 for this is what the lord has said i will do to you as you have done you who putting the oath on one side have let the agreement be broken
 but still i will keep in mind the agreement made with you in the days when you were young and i will make with you an eternal agreement
 then at the memory of your ways you will be overcome with shame when i take your sisters the older and the younger and give them to you for daughters but not by your agreement
 and i will make my agreement with you and you will be certain that i am the lord
 so that at the memory of these things you may be at a loss never opening your mouth because of your shame when you have my forgiveness for all you have done says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man give out a dark saying and make a comparison for the children of israel
 and say this is what the lord has said a great eagle with great wings full of long feathers of different colours came to lebanon and took the top of the cedar
 biting off the highest of its young branches he took it to the land of canaan and put it in a town of traders
 and he took some of the seed of the land planting it in fertile earth placing it by great waters he put it in like a willow tree
 and its growth went on and it became a vine low and widely stretching whose branches were turned to him and its roots were under him so it became a vine putting out branches and young leaves
 and there was another eagle with great wings and thick feathers and now this vine pushing out its roots to him sent out its branches in his direction from the bed where it was planted so that he might give it water
 he had it planted in a good field by great waters so that it might put out branches and have fruit and be a strong vine
 say this is what the lord has said will it do well will he not have its roots pulled up and its branches cut off so that all its young leaves may become dry and it may be pulled up by its roots
 and if it is planted will it do well will it not become quite dry at the touch of the east wind drying up in the bed where it was planted
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 say now to this uncontrolled people are these things not clear to you say to them see the king of babylon came to jerusalem and took its king and its rulers away with him to babylon
 and he took one of the sons of the king and made an agreement with him and he put him under an oath and took away the great men of the land
 so that the kingdom might be made low with no power of lifting itself up but might keep his agreement to be his servants
 but he went against his authority in sending representatives to egypt to get from them horses and a great army will he do well will he be safe who does such things if the agreement is broken will he be safe
 by my life says the lord truly in the place of the king who made him king whose oath he put on one side and let his agreement with him be broken even in babylon he will come to his death
 and pharaoh with his strong army and great forces will be no help to him in the war when they put up earthworks and make strong walls for the cutting off of lives
 for he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken and though he had given his hand to it he did all these things he will not get away safe
 and so the lord has said by my life truly for my oath which he put on one side and my agreement which has been broken i will send punishment on his head
 my net will be stretched out over him and he will be taken in my cords and i will send him to babylon and there i will be his judge for the wrong which he has done against me
 all his best fighting men will be put to the sword and the rest will be sent away to every wind and you will be certain that i the lord have said it
 this is what the lord has said further i will take the highest top of the cedar and put it in the earth cutting off from the highest of his young branches a soft one i will have it planted on a high and great mountain
 it will be planted on the high mountain of israel it will put out branches and have fruit and be a fair cedar under it all birds of every sort will make their living place resting in the shade of its branches
 and it will be clear to all the trees of the field that i the lord have made low the high tree and made high the low tree drying up the green tree and making the dry tree full of growth i the lord have said it and have done it
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 why do you make use of this saying about the land of israel the fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the childrens teeth are on edge
 by my life says the lord you will no longer have this saying in israel
 see all souls are mine as the soul of the father so the soul of the son is mine death will be the fate of the sinners soul
 but if a man is upright living rightly and doing righteousness
 and has not taken flesh with the blood for food or given worship to the images of the children of israel if he has not had connection with his neighbours wife or come near to a woman at the time when she is unclean
 and has done no wrong to any but has given back to the debtor what is his and has taken no ones goods by force and has given food to him who was in need of it and clothing to him who was without it
 and has not given his money out at interest or taken great profits and turning his hand from evil doing has kept faith between man and man
 and has been guided by my rules and has kept my laws and done them he is upright life will certainly be his says the lord
 if he has a son who is a thief a taker of life who does any of these things
 who has taken flesh with the blood as food and has had connection with his neighbours wife
 has done wrong to the poor and to him who is in need and taken property by force and has not given back to one in his debt what is his and has given worship to images and has done disgusting things
 and has given out his money at interest and taken great profits he will certainly not go on living he has done all these disgusting things death will certainly be his fate his blood will be on him
 now if he has a son who sees all his fathers sins which he has done and in fear does not do the same
 who has not taken the flesh with the blood for food or given worship to the images of the children of israel and has not had connection with his neighbours wife
 or done wrong to any or taken anything from one in his debt or taken goods by force but has given food to him who was in need of it and clothing to him who was without it
 who has kept his hand from evil doing and has not taken interest or great profits who has done my orders and been guided by my rules he will certainly not be put to death for the evil doing of his father life will certainly be his
 as for his father because he was cruel took goods by force and did what is not good among his people truly death will overtake him in his evil doing
 but you say why does not the son undergo punishment for the evil doing of the father when the son has done what is ordered and right and has kept my rules and done them life will certainly be his
 the soul which does sin will be put to death the son will not be made responsible for the evil doing of the father or the father for the evil doing of the son the righteousness of the upright will be on himself and the evil doing of the evil doer on himself
 but if the evil doer turning away from all the sins which he has done keeps my rules and does what is ordered and right life will certainly be his death will not be his fate
 not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in memory against him in the righteousness which he has done he will have life
 have i any pleasure in the death of the evil doer says the lord am i not pleased if he is turned from his way so that he may have life
 but when the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil like all the disgusting things which the evil man does will he have life not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory in the wrong which he has done and in his sin death will overtake him
 but you say the way of the lord is not equal give ear now o children of israel is my way not equal are not your ways unequal
 when the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil death will overtake him in the evil which he has done death will overtake him
 again when the evil doer turning away from the evil he has done does what is ordered and right he will have life for his soul
 because he had fear and was turned away from all the wrong which he had done life will certainly be his death will not be his fate
 but still the children of israel say the way of the lord is not equal o children of israel are my ways not equal are not your ways unequal
 for this cause i will be your judge o children of israel judging every man by his ways says the lord come back and be turned from all your sins so that they may not be the cause of your falling into evil
 put away all your evil doing in which you have done sin and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit why are you desiring death o children of israel
 for i have no pleasure in the death of him on whom death comes says the lord be turned back then and have life
 take up now a song of grief for the ruler of israel and say
 what was your mother like a she lion among lions stretched out among the young lions she gave food to her little ones
 and one of her little ones came to growth under her care and became a young lion learning to go after beasts for his food and he took men for his meat
 and the nations had news of him he was taken in the hole they had made and pulling him with hooks they took him into the land of egypt
 now when she saw that her hope was made foolish and gone she took another of her little ones and made him into a young lion
 and he went up and down among the lions and became a young lion learning to go after beasts for his food and he took men for his meat
 and he sent destruction on their widows and made waste their towns and the land and everything in it became waste because of the loud sound of his voice
 then the nations came against him from the kingdoms round about their net was stretched over him and he was taken in the hole they had made
 they made him a prisoner with hooks and took him to the king of babylon they put him in the strong place so that his voice might be sounding no longer on the mountains of israel
 your mother was in comparison like a vine planted by the waters she was fertile and full of branches because of the great waters
 and she had a strong rod for a rod of authority for the rulers and it became tall among the clouds and it was seen lifted up among the number of its branches
 but she was uprooted in burning wrath and made low on the earth the east wind came drying her up and her branches were broken off her strong rod became dry the fire made a meal of it
 and now she is planted in the waste land in a dry and unwatered country
 and fire has gone out from her rod causing the destruction of her branches so that there is no strong rod in her to be the rulers rod of authority this is a song of grief and it was for a song of grief
 and he said to me son of man get up on your feet so that i may say words to you
 and at his words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet and his voice came to my ears
 and he said to me son of man i am sending you to the children of israel to an uncontrolled nation which has gone against me they and their fathers have been sinners against me even to this very day
 and the children are hard and stiff hearted i am sending you to them and you are to say to them these are the words of the lord
 and they if they give ear to you or if they do not give ear  for they are an uncontrolled people  will see that there has been a prophet among them
 and you son of man have no fear of them or of their words even if sharp thorns are round you and you are living among scorpions have no fear of their words and do not be overcome by their looks for they are an uncontrolled people
 and you are to give them my words if they give ear to you or if they do not for they are uncontrolled
 but you son of man give ear to what i say to you and do not be uncontrolled like that uncontrolled people let your mouth be open and take what i give you
 and looking i saw a hand stretched out to me and i saw the roll of a book in it
 and he put it open before me and it had writing on the front and on the back words of grief and sorrow and trouble were recorded in it
 now it came about in the seventh year in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month that certain of the responsible men of israel came to get directions from the lord and were seated before me
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man say to the responsible men of israel this is what the lord has said have you come to get directions from me by my life says the lord you will get no directions from me
 will you be their judge o son of man will you be their judge make clear to them the disgusting ways of their fathers
 and say to them this is what the lord has said in the day when i took israel for myself when i made an oath to the seed of the family of jacob and i gave them knowledge of myself in the land of egypt saying to them with an oath i am the lord your god
 in that day i gave my oath to take them out of the land of egypt into a land which i had been searching out for them a land flowing with milk and honey the glory of all lands
 and i said to them let every man among you put away the disgusting things to which his eyes are turned and do not make yourselves unclean with the images of egypt i am the lord your god
 but they would not be controlled by me and did not give ear to me they did not put away the disgusting things to which their eyes were turned or give up the images of egypt then i said i would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the land of egypt
 and i was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean before the eyes of the nations among whom they were and before whose eyes i gave them knowledge of myself by taking them out of the land of egypt
 so i made them go out of the land of egypt and took them into the waste land
 and i gave them my rules and made clear to them my orders which if a man keeps them will be life to him
 and further i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them so that it might be clear that i who make them holy am the lord
 but the children of israel would not be controlled by me in the waste land they were not guided by my rules and they were turned away from my orders which if a man does them will be life to him and they had no respect for my sabbaths then i said that i would let loose my passion on them in the waste land and put an end to them
 and i was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean in the eyes of the nations before whose eyes i had taken them out
 and further i gave my oath to them in the waste land that i would not take them into the land which i had given them a land flowing with milk and honey the glory of all lands
 because they were turned away from my orders and were not guided by my rules and had no respect for my sabbaths for their hearts went after their images
 but still my eye had pity on them and i kept them from destruction and did not put an end to them completely in the waste land
 and i said to their children in the waste land do not be guided by the rules of your fathers or keep their orders or make yourselves unclean with their images
 i am the lord your god be guided by my rules and keep my orders and do them
 and keep my sabbaths holy and they will be a sign between me and you so that it may be clear to you that i am the lord your god
 but the children would not be controlled by me they were not guided by my rules and they did not keep and do my orders which if a man does them will be life to him and they had no respect for my sabbaths then i said i would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the waste land
 and i was acting for the honour of my name so that it might not be made unclean in the eyes of the nations before whose eyes i had taken them out
 further i gave my oath to them in the waste land that i would send them wandering among the nations driving them out among the countries
 because they had not done my orders but had been turned away from my rules and had not given respect to my sabbaths and their eyes were turned to the images of their fathers
 and further i gave them rules which were not good and orders in which there was no life for them
 i made them unclean in the offerings they gave causing them to make every first child go through the fire so that i might put an end to them
 for this cause son of man say to the children of israel this is what the lord has said in this your fathers have further put shame on my name by doing wrong against me
 for when i had taken them into the land which i made an oath to give to them then they saw every high hill and every branching tree and made their offerings there moving me to wrath by their offerings and there the sweet smell of their offerings went up and their drink offerings were drained out
 then i said to them what is this high place where you go to no purpose and it is named bamah to this day
 for this cause say to the children of israel this is what the lord has said are you making yourselves unclean as your fathers did are you being untrue to me by going after their disgusting works
 and when you give your offerings causing your sons to go through the fire you make yourselves unclean with all your images to this day and will you come to me for directions o children of israel by my life says the lord you will get no direction from me
 and that which comes into your minds will never take place when you say we will be like the nations like the families of the countries servants of wood and stone
 by my life says the lord truly with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with burning wrath let loose i will be king over you
 and i will take you out from the peoples and get you together out of the countries where you are wandering with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with burning wrath let loose
 and i will take you into the waste land of the peoples and there i will take up the cause with you face to face
 as i took up the cause with your fathers in the waste land of the land of egypt so will i take up the cause with you says the lord
 and i will make you go under the rod and will make you small in number
 clearing out from among you all those who are uncontrolled and who are sinning against me i will take them out of the land where they are living but they will not come into the land of israel and you will be certain that i am the lord
 as for you o children of israel the lord has said let every man completely put away his images and give ear to me and let my holy name no longer be shamed by your offerings and your images
 for in my holy mountain in the high mountain of israel says the lord there all the children of israel all of them will be my servants in the land there i will take pleasure in them and there i will be worshipped with your offerings and the first fruits of the things you give and with all your holy things
 i will take pleasure in you as in a sweet smell when i take you out from the peoples and get you together from the countries where you have been sent in flight and i will make myself holy in you before the eyes of the nations
 and you will be certain that i am the lord when i take you into the land of israel into the country which i made an oath to give to your fathers
 and there at the memory of your ways and of all the things you did to make yourselves unclean you will have bitter hate for yourselves because of all the evil things you have done
 and you will be certain that i am the lord when i take you in hand for the honour of my name and not for your evil ways or your unclean doings o children of israel says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to the south let your words be dropped to the south and be a prophet against the woodland of the south
 and say to the woodland of the south give ear to the words of the lord this is what the lord has said see i will have a fire lighted in you for the destruction of every green tree in you and every dry tree the flaming flame will not be put out and all faces from the south to the north will be burned by it
 and all flesh will see that i the lord have had it lighted it will not be put out
 then i said ah lord  they say of me is he not a maker of stories
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to jerusalem let your words be dropped in the direction of her holy place and be a prophet against the land of israel
 and say to the land of israel these are the words of the lord see i am against you and i will take my sword out of its cover cutting off from you the upright and the evil
 because i am going to have the upright and the evil cut off from you for this cause my sword will go out from its cover against all flesh from the south to the north
 and all flesh will see that i the lord have taken my sword out of its cover and it will never go back
 make sounds of grief son of man with body bent and a bitter heart make sounds of grief before their eyes
 and when they say to you why are you making sounds of grief then say because of the news for it is coming and every heart will become soft and all hands will be feeble and every spirit will be burning low and all knees will be turned to water see it is coming and it will be done says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man say as a prophet these are the words of the lord say a sword a sword which has been made sharp and polished
 it has been made sharp to give death it is polished so that it may be like a thunder flame 
 and i have given it to the polisher so that it may be taken in the hand he has made the sword sharp he has had it polished to put it into the hand of him who gives death
 give loud cries and make sounds of grief o son of man for it has come on my people it has come on all the rulers of israel fear of the sword has come on my people for this cause give signs of grief
 
 so then son of man be a prophet and put your hands together with a loud sound and give two blows with the sword and even three it is the sword of those who are wounded even the sword of the wounded the great sword which goes round about them
 in order that hearts may become soft and the number of those who are falling may be increased i have sent death by the sword against all their doors you are made like a flame you are polished for death
 be pointed to the right to the left wherever your edge is ordered
 and i will put my hands together with a loud sound and i will let my wrath have rest i the lord have said it
 and the word of the lord came to me again saying
 and you son of man have two ways marked out so that the sword of the king of babylon may come let the two of them come out of one land and let there be a pillar at the top of the road
 put a pillar at the top of the road for the sword to come to rabbah in the land of the children of ammon and to judah and to jerusalem in the middle of her
 for the king of babylon took his place at the parting of the ways at the top of the two roads to make use of secret arts shaking the arrows this way and that he put questions to the images of his gods he took note of the inner parts of dead beasts
 at his right hand was the fate of jerusalem to give orders for destruction to send up the war cry to put engines of war against the doors lifting up earthworks building walls
 and this answer given by secret arts will seem false to those who have given their oaths and have let them be broken but he will keep the memory of evil doing so that they may be taken
 for this cause the lord has said because you have made your evil doing come to mind by the uncovering of your wrongdoing causing your sins to be seen in all your evil doings because you have come to mind you will be taken in them
 and you o evil one wounded to death o ruler of israel whose day has come in the time of the last punishment
 this is what the lord has said take away the holy head dress take off the crown this will not be again let that which is low be lifted up and that which is high be made low
 i will let it be overturned overturned overturned this will not be again till he comes whose right it is and i will give it to him
 and you son of man say as a prophet this is what the lord has said about the children of ammon and about their shame say a sword even a sword let loose polished for death to make it shining so that it may be like a flame
 your vision is to no purpose your use of secret arts gives a false answer to put it on the necks of evil doers who are wounded to death whose day has come in the time of the last punishment
 go back into your cover in the place where you were made in the land from which you were taken i will be your judge
 and i will let loose my burning passion on you breathing out on you the fire of my wrath and i will give you up into the hands of men like beasts trained to destruction
 you will be food for the fire your blood will be drained out in the land there will be no more memory of you for i the lord have said it
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 and you son of man will you be a judge will you be a judge of the town of blood then make clear to her all her disgusting ways
 and you are to say this is what the lord has said a town causing blood to be drained out in her streets so that her time may come and making images in her to make her unclean 
 you are responsible for the blood drained out by you and you are unclean through the images which you have made and you have made your day come near and the time of your judging has come for this cause i have made you a name of shame to the nations and a cause of laughing to all countries
 those who are near and those who are far from you will make sport of you your name is unclean you are full of sounds of fear
 see the rulers of israel every one in his family have been causing death in you
 in you they have had no respect for father and mother in you they have been cruel to the man from a strange land in you they have done wrong to the child without a father and to the widow
 you have made little of my holy things and have made my sabbaths unclean
 in you there are men who say evil of others causing death in you they have taken the flesh with the blood for food in your streets they have put evil designs into effect
 in you they have let the shame of their fathers be seen in you they have done wrong to a woman at the time when she was unclean
 and in you one man has done what was disgusting with his neighbours wife and another has made his daughter in law unclean and another has done wrong to his sister his fathers daughter
 in you they have taken rewards as the price of blood you have taken interest and great profits and you have taken away your neighbours goods by force and have not kept me in mind says the lord
 see then i have made my hands come together in wrath against your taking of goods by force and against the blood which has been flowing in you
 will your heart be high or your hands strong in the days when i take you in hand i the lord have said it and will do it
 and i will send you in flight among the nations and wandering among the countries and i will completely take away out of you everything which is unclean
 and you will be made low before the eyes of the nations and it will be clear to you that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man the children of israel have become like the poorest sort of waste metal to me they are all silver and brass and tin and iron and lead mixed with waste
 for this cause the lord has said because you have all become waste metal see i will get you together inside jerusalem
 as they put silver and brass and iron and lead and tin together inside the oven heating up the fire on it to make it soft so will i get you together in my wrath and in my passion and heating the fire with my breath will make you soft
 yes i will take you breathing on you the fire of my wrath and you will become soft in it
 as silver becomes soft in the oven so you will become soft in it and you will be certain that i the lord have let loose my passion on you
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man say to her you are a land on which no rain or thunderstorm has come in the day of wrath
 her rulers in her are like a loud voiced lion violently taking his food they have made a meal of souls they have taken wealth and valued property they have made great the number of widows in her
 her priests have been acting violently against my law they have made my holy things unclean they have made no division between what is holy and what is common and they have not made it clear that the unclean is different from the clean and their eyes have been shut to my sabbaths and i am not honoured among them
 her rulers in her are like wolves violently taking their food putting men to death and causing the destruction of souls so that they may get their profit
 and her prophets have been using whitewash seeing foolish visions and making false use of secret arts saying this is what the lord has said when the lord has said nothing
 the people of the land have been acting cruelly taking mens goods by force they have been hard on the poor and those in need and have done wrong to the man from a strange land
 and i was looking for a man among them who would make up the wall and take his station in the broken place before me for the land so that i might not send destruction on it but there was no one
 and i let loose my passion on them and have put an end to them in the fire of my wrath i have made the punishment of their ways come on their heads says the lord
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 son of man there were two women daughters of one mother
 they were acting like loose women in egypt when they were young their behaviour was loose there their breasts were crushed even the points of their young breasts were crushed
 their names were oholah the older and oholibah her sister and they became mine and gave birth to sons and daughters as for their names samaria is oholah and jerusalem oholibah
 and oholah was untrue to me when she was mine she was full of desire for her lovers even for the assyrians her neighbours
 who were clothed in blue captains and rulers all of them young men to be desired horsemen seated on horses
 and she gave her unclean love to them all of them the noblest men of assyria and she made herself unclean with the images of all who were desired by her
 and she has not given up her loose ways from the time when she was in egypt for when she was young they were her lovers and by them her young breasts were crushed and they let loose on her their unclean desire
 for this cause i gave her up into the hands of her lovers into the hands of the assyrians on whom her desire was fixed
 by these her shame was uncovered they took her sons and daughters and put her to death with the sword and she became a cause of wonder to women for they gave her the punishment which was right
 and her sister oholibah saw this but her desire was even more unmeasured and her loose behaviour was worse than that of her sister
 she was full of desire for the assyrians captains and rulers her neighbours clothed in blue horsemen going on horses all of them young men to be desired
 and i saw that she had become unclean the two of them went the same way
 and her loose behaviour became worse for she saw men pictured on a wall pictures of the chaldaeans painted in bright red
 with bands round their bodies and with head dresses hanging round their heads all of them looking like rulers like the babylonians the land of whose birth is chaldaea
 and when she saw them she was full of desire for them and sent servants to them in chaldaea
 and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and made her unclean with their loose desire and she became unclean with them and her soul was turned from them
 so her loose behaviour was clearly seen and her shame uncovered then my soul was turned from her as it had been turned from her sister
 but still she went on the more with her loose behaviour keeping in mind the early days when she had been a loose woman in the land of egypt
 and she was full of desire for her lovers whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose seed is like the seed of horses
 and she made the memory of the loose ways of her early years come back to mind when her young breasts were crushed by the egyptians
 for this cause o oholibah this is what the lord has said see i will make your lovers come up against you even those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust and i will make them come up against you on every side
 the babylonians and all the chaldaeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them young men to be desired captains and rulers all of them and chiefs her neighbours all of them on horseback
 and they will come against you from the north on horseback with war carriages and a great band of peoples they will put themselves in order against you with breastplate and body cover and metal head dress round about you and i will make them your judges and they will give their decision against you as seems right to them
 and my bitter feeling will be working against you and they will take you in hand with passion they will take away your nose and your ears and the rest of you will be put to the sword they will take your sons and daughters and the rest of you will be burned up in the fire
 and they will take all your clothing off you and take away your ornaments
 so i will put an end to your evil ways and your loose behaviour which came from the land of egypt and your eyes will never be lifted up to them again and you will have no more memory of egypt
 for this is what the lord has said see i will give you up into the hands of those who are hated by you into the hands of those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust
 and they will take you in hand with hate and take away all the fruit of your work and let you be unveiled and without clothing and the shame of your loose behaviour will be uncovered your evil designs and your loose ways
 they will do these things to you because you have been untrue to me and have gone after the nations and have become unclean with their images
 you have gone in the way of your sister and i will give her cup into your hand
 this is what the lord has said you will take a drink from your sisters cup which is deep and wide you will be laughed at and looked down on more than you are able to undergo
 you will be broken and full of sorrow with the cup of wonder and destruction with the cup of your sister samaria
 and after drinking it and draining it out you will take the last drops of it to the end pulling off your breasts for i have said it says the lord
 so this is what the lord has said because you have not kept me in your memory and because your back has been turned to me you will even undergo the punishment of your evil designs and your loose ways
 then the lord said to me son of man will you be the judge of oholibah then make clear to her the disgusting things she has done
 for she has been false to me and blood is on her hands and with her images she has been untrue and more than this she made her sons whom she had by me go through the fire to them to be burned up
 further this is what she has done to me she has made my holy place unclean and has made my sabbaths unclean
 for when she had made an offering of her children to her images she came into my holy place to make it unclean see this is what she has done inside my house
 and she even sent for men to come from far away to whom a servant was sent and they came for whom she was washing her body and painting her eyes and making herself fair with ornaments
 and she took her seat on a great bed with a table put ready before it on which she put my perfume and my oil
  and they put jewels on her hands and beautiful crowns on her head
 then i said  now she will go on with her loose ways
 and they went in to her as men go to a loose woman so they went in to oholibah the loose woman
 and upright men will be her judges judging her as false wives and women who take lives are judged because she has been untrue to me and blood is on her hands
 for this is what the lord has said i will make a great meeting of the people come together against her and will send on her shaking fear and take everything from her
 and the meeting after stoning her with stones will put an end to her with their swords they will put her sons and daughters to death and have her house burned up with fire
 and i will put an end to evil in all the land teaching all women not to do as you have done
 and i will send on you the punishment of your evil ways and you will be rewarded for your sins with your images and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me in the ninth year in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month saying
 son of man put down in writing this very day the king of babylon let loose the weight of his attack against jerusalem on this very day
 and make a comparison for this uncontrolled people and say to them this is what the lord has said put on the cooking pot put it on the fire and put water in it
 and get the bits together the fat tail every good part the leg and the top part of it make it full of the best bones
 take the best of the flock put much wood under it see that its bits are boiling well let the bones be cooked inside it
 for this is what the lord has said a curse is on the town of blood the cooking pot which is unclean inside which has never been made clean  take out its bits its fate is still to come on it
 for her blood is in her she has put it on the open rock not draining it on to the earth so that it might be covered with dust
 in order that it might make wrath come up to give punishment she has put her blood on the open rock so that it may not be covered
 for this cause the lord has said a curse is on the town of blood  and i will make great the burning mass
 put on much wood heating up the fire boiling the flesh well and making the soup thick and let the bones be burned
 and i will put her on the coals so that she may be heated and her brass burned so that what is unclean in her may become soft and her waste be completely taken away
 i have made myself tired to no purpose still all the waste which is in her has not come out it has an evil smell
 as for your unclean purpose because i have been attempting to make you clean but you have not been made clean from it you will not be made clean till i have let loose my passion on you in full measure
 i the lord have said the word and i will do it i will not go back or have mercy and my purpose will not be changed in the measure of your ways and of your evil doings you will be judged says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man see i am taking away the desire of your eyes by disease but let there be no sorrow or weeping or drops running from your eyes
 let there be no sound of sorrow make no weeping for your dead put on your head dress and your shoes on your feet let not your lips be covered and do not take the food of those in grief
 so in the morning i was teaching the people and in the evening death took my wife and in the morning i did what i had been ordered to do
 and the people said to me will you not make clear to us the sense of these things is it for us you do them
 then i said to them the word of the lord came to me saying
 say to the people of israel the lord has said see i will make my holy place unclean the pride of your strength the pleasure of your eyes and the desire of your soul and your sons and daughters who did not come with you here will be put to the sword
 and you will do as i have done not covering your lips or taking the food of those in grief
 and your head dresses will be on your heads and your shoes on your feet there will be no sorrow or weeping but you will be wasting away in the punishment of your evil doing and you will be looking at one another in wonder
 and ezekiel will be a sign to you everything he has done you will do when this takes place you will be certain that i am the lord
 and as for you son of man your mouth will be shut in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that on which their hearts are fixed and their sons and daughters
 in that day one who has got away safe will come to you to give you news of it
 in that day your mouth will be open to him who has got away safe and you will say words to him and your lips will no longer be shut so you will be a sign to them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to the children of ammon and be a prophet against them
 and say to the children of ammon give ear to the word of the lord this is what the lord has said because you said aha  against my holy place when it was made unclean and against the land of israel when it was made waste and against the people of judah when they were taken away as prisoners
 for this cause i will give you up to the children of the east for their heritage and they will put their tent circles in you and make their houses in you they will take your fruit for their food and your milk for their drink
 and i will make rabbah a place for housing camels and the children of ammon a resting place for flocks and you will be certain that i am the lord
 for the lord has said because you have made sounds of joy with your hands stamping your feet and have been glad putting shame with all your soul on the land of israel
 for this cause my hand has been stretched out against you and i will give up your goods to be taken by the nations i will have you cut off from the peoples and will put an end to you among the countries i will give you up to destruction and you will be certain that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said because moab and seir are saying see the people of judah are like all the nations
 for this cause i will let the side of moab be uncovered and his towns on every side the glory of the land beth jeshimoth baal meon and as far as kiriathaim
 to the children of the east i have given her for a heritage as well as the children of ammon so that there may be no memory of her among the nations
 and i will be the judge of moab and they will see that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said because edom has taken his payment from the people of judah and has done great wrong in taking payment from them
 the lord has said my hand will be stretched out against edom cutting off from it man and beast and i will make it waste from teman even as far as dedan they will be put to the sword
 i will take payment from edom because of my people israel and i will take edom in hand in my wrath and in my passion and they will have experience of my reward says the lord
 this is what the lord has said because the philistines have taken payment with the purpose of causing shame and destruction with unending hate
 the lord has said see my hand will be stretched out against the philistines cutting off the cherethites and sending destruction on the rest of the sea land
 and i will take great payment from them with acts of wrath and they will be certain that i am the lord when i send my punishment on them
 now in the eleventh year on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man because tyre has said against jerusalem aha she who was the doorway of the peoples is broken she is turned over to them she who was full is made waste
 for this cause the lord has said see i am against you o tyre and will send up a number of nations against you as the sea sends up its waves
 and they will give the walls of tyre to destruction and have its towers broken and i will take even her dust away from her and make her an uncovered rock
 she will be a place for the stretching out of nets in the middle of the sea for i have said it says the lord and her goods will be given over to the nations
 and her daughters in the open country will be put to the sword and they will be certain that i am the lord
 for this is what the lord has said see i will send up from the north nebuchadrezzar king of babylon king of kings against tyre with horses and war carriages and with an army and great numbers of people
 he will put to the sword your daughters in the open country he will make strong walls against you and put up an earthwork against you arming himself for war against you
 he will put up his engines of war against your walls and your towers will be broken down by his axes
 because of the number of his horses you will be covered with their dust your walls will be shaking at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the war carriages when he comes through your doorways as into a town which has been broken open
 your streets will be stamped down by the feet of his horses he will put your people to the sword and will send down the pillars of your strength to the earth
 they will take by force all your wealth and go off with the goods with which you do trade they will have your walls broken down and all the houses of your desire given up to destruction they will put your stones and your wood and your dust deep in the water
 i will put an end to the noise of your songs and the sound of your instruments of music will be gone for ever
 i will make you an uncovered rock you will be a place for the stretching out of nets there will be no building you up again for i the lord have said it says the lord
 this is what the lord has said to tyre will not the sea lands be shaking at the sound of your fall when the wounded give cries of pain when men are put to the sword in you
 then all the rulers of the sea will come down from their high seats and put away their robes and take off their clothing of needlework they will put on the clothing of grief they will take their seats on the earth shaking with fear every minute and overcome with wonder at you
 and they will send up a song of grief for you and say to you what destruction has come on you how are you cut off from the sea the noted town which was strong in the sea she and her people causing the fear of them to come on all the dry land 
 now the sea lands will be shaking in the day of your fall and all the ships on the sea will be overcome with fear at your going
 for this is what the lord has said i will make you a waste town like the towns which are unpeopled when i make the deep come upon you covering you with great waters
 then i will make you go down with those who go down into the underworld to the people of the past causing your living place to be in the deepest parts of the earth in places long unpeopled with those who go down into the deep so that there will be no one living in you and you will have no glory in the land of the living
 i will make you a thing of fear and you will come to an end even if you are looked for you will not be seen again for ever says the lord
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 and you son of man make a song of grief for tyre
 and say to tyre o you who are seated at the doorway of the sea trading for the peoples with the great sea lands these are the words of the lord you o tyre have said i am a ship completely beautiful
 your builders have made your outlines in the heart of the seas they have made you completely beautiful
 they have made all your boards of fir trees from senir they have taken cedars from lebanon to make the supports for your sails
 of oak trees from bashan they have made your driving blades they have made your floors of ivory and boxwood from the sea lands of kittim
 the best linen with needlework from egypt was your sail stretched out to be a flag for you blue and purple from the sea lands of elishah gave you shade
 the people of zidon and arvad were your boatmen the wise men of zemer were in you they were guiding your ships

 haran and canneh and eden the traders of asshur and all the medes
 these were your traders in beautiful robes in rolls of blue and needlework and in chests of coloured cloth corded with cords and made of cedar wood in them they did trade with you
 tarshish ships did business for you in your goods and you were made full and great was your glory in the heart of the seas
 your boatmen have taken you into great waters you have been broken by the east wind in the heart of the seas
 your wealth and your goods the things in which you do trade your seamen and those guiding your ships those who make your boards watertight and those who do business with your goods and all your men of war who are in you with all who have come together in you will go down into the heart of the seas in the day of your downfall
 at the sound of the cry of your ships guides the boards of the ship will be shaking
 and all the boatmen the seamen and those who are expert at guiding a ship through the sea will come down from their ships and take their places on the land
 and their voices will be sounding over you and crying bitterly they will put dust on their heads rolling themselves in the dust
 and they will have the hair of their heads cut off because of you and will put haircloth on their bodies weeping for you with bitter grief in their souls even with bitter sorrow
 and in their weeping they will make a song of grief for you sorrowing over you and saying who is like tyre who has come to an end in the deep sea
 when your goods went out over the seas you made numbers of peoples full the wealth of the kings of the earth was increased with your great wealth and all your goods
 now that you are broken by the seas in the deep waters your goods and all your people will go down with you
 all the people of the sea lands are overcome with wonder at you and their kings are full of fear their faces are troubled
 those who do business among the peoples make sounds of surprise at you you have become a thing of fear you have come to an end for ever
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 son of man say to the ruler of tyre this is what the lord has said because your heart has been lifted up and you have said i am a god i am seated on the seat of god in the heart of the seas but you are man and not god though you have made your heart as the heart of god
 see you are wiser than daniel there is no secret which is deeper than your knowledge
 by your wisdom and deep knowledge you have got power for yourself and put silver and gold in your store houses
 by your great wisdom and by your trade your power is increased and your heart is lifted up because of your power
 for this cause the lord has said because you have made your heart as the heart of god
 see i am sending against you strange men feared among the nations they will let loose their swords against your bright wisdom they will make your glory a common thing
 they will send you down to the underworld and your death will be the death of those who are put to the sword in the heart of the seas
 will you say in the face of those who are taking your life i am god but you are man and not god in the hands of those who are wounding you
 your death will be the death of those who are without circumcision by the hands of men from strange lands for i have said it says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man make a song of grief for the king of tyre and say to him this is what the lord has said you are all wise and completely beautiful
 you were in eden the garden of god every stone of great price was your clothing the sardius the topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the emerald and the carbuncle your store houses were full of gold and things of great price were in you in the day when you were made they were got ready
 i gave you your place with the winged one i put you on the mountain of god you went up and down among the stones of fire
 there has been no evil in your ways from the day when you were made till sin was seen in you
 through all your trading you have become full of violent ways and have done evil so i sent you out shamed from the mountain of god the winged one put an end to you from among the stones of fire
 your heart was lifted up because you were beautiful you made your wisdom evil through your sin i have sent you down even to the earth i have made you low before kings so that they may see you
 by all your sin even by your evil trading you have made your holy places unclean so i will make a fire come out from you it will make a meal of you and i will make you as dust on the earth before the eyes of all who see you
 all who have knowledge of you among the peoples will be overcome with wonder at you you have become a thing of fear and you will never be seen again
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to zidon and be a prophet against it and say
 these are the words of the lord see i am against you o zidon and i will get glory for myself in you and they will be certain that i am the lord when i send my punishments on her and i will be seen to be holy in her
 and i will send on her disease and blood in her streets and the wounded will be falling in the middle of her and the sword will be against her on every side and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and there will no longer be a plant with sharp points wounding the children of israel or a thorn troubling them among any who are round about them who put shame on them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said when i have got together the children of israel from the peoples among whom they are wandering and have been made holy among them before the eyes of the nations then they will have rest in the land which is theirs which i gave to my servant jacob
 and they will be safe there building houses and planting vine gardens and living without fear when i have sent my punishments on all those who put shame on them round about them and they will be certain that i am the lord their god
 in the tenth year in the tenth month on the twelfth day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned against pharaoh king of egypt and be a prophet against him and against all egypt
 say to them these are the words of the lord see i am against you pharaoh king of egypt the great river beast stretched out among his nile streams who has said the nile is mine and i have made it for myself
 and i will put hooks in your mouth and the fish of your streams will be hanging from your skin and i will make you come up out of your streams with all the fish of your streams hanging from your skin
 and i will let you be in the waste land you and all the fish of your streams you will go down on the face of the land you will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth i have given you for food to the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven
 and it will be clear to all the people of egypt that i am the lord because you have been a false support to the children of israel
 when they took a grip of you in their hands you were crushed so that their arms were broken and when they put their weight on you for support you were broken and all their muscles gave way
 for this cause the lord has said see i am sending a sword on you cutting off from you man and beast
 and the land of egypt will be an unpeopled waste and they will be certain that i am the lord because he has said the nile is mine and i made it
 see then i am against you and against your streams and i will make the land of egypt an unpeopled waste from migdol to syene even as far as the edge of ethiopia
 no foot of man will go through it and no foot of beast and it will be unpeopled for forty years
 i will make the land of egypt a waste among the countries which are made waste and her towns will be unpeopled among the towns which have been made waste for forty years and i will send the egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries
 for this is what the lord has said at the end of forty years i will get the egyptians together from the peoples where they have gone in flight
 i will let the fate of egypt be changed and will make them come back into the land of pathros into the land from which they came and there they will be an unimportant kingdom
 it will be the lowest of the kingdoms and never again will it be lifted up over the nations i will make them small so that they may not have rule over the nations
 and egypt will no longer be the hope of the children of israel causing sin to come to mind when their eyes are turned to them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the twenty seventh year in the first month on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made his army do hard work against tyre and the hair came off every head and every arm was rubbed smooth but he and his army got no payment out of tyre for the hard work which he had done against it
 for this cause the lord has said see i am giving the land of egypt to nebuchadrezzar king of babylon he will take away her wealth and take her goods by force and everything which is there and this will be the payment for his army
 i have given him the land of egypt as the reward for his hard work because they were working for me says the lord
 in that day i will make a horn put out buds for the children of israel and i will let your words come freely among them and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and he said to me son of man take this roll for your food and go and say my words to the children of israel
 and on my opening my mouth he made me take the roll as food
 and he said to me son of man let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which i am giving you then i took it and it was sweet as honey in my mouth
 and he said to me son of man go now to the children of israel and say my words to them
 for you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard but to the children of israel
 not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you truly if i sent you to them they would give ear to you
 but the children of israel will not give ear to you for they have no mind to give ear to me for all the children of israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart
 see i have made your face hard against their faces and your brow hard against their brows
 like a diamond harder than rock i have made your brow have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks for they are an uncontrolled people
 then he said to me son of man take into your heart all my words which i am about to say to you and let your ears be open to them
 and go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners to the children of your people and say to them this is what the lord has said if they give ear or if they do not
 then i was lifted up by the wind and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the lord was lifted up from his place
 and there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another and the sound of the wheels at their side the sound of a great rushing
 and the wind lifting me up took me away and i went in the heat of my spirit and the hand of the lord was strong on me
 then i came to those who had been taken away as prisoners who were at telabib by the river chebar and i was seated among them full of wonder for seven days
 and at the end of seven days the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man i have made you a watchman for the children of israel so give ear to the word of my mouth and give them word from me of their danger
 when i say to the evil doer death will certainly be your fate and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evil doer the danger of his evil way so that he may be safe that same evil man will come to death in his evil doing but i will make you responsible for his blood
 but if you give the evil doer word of his danger and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way death will overtake him in his evil doing but your life will be safe
 again when an upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil and i put a cause of falling in his way death will overtake him because you have given him no word of his danger death will overtake him in his evil doing and there will be no memory of the upright acts which he has done but i will make you responsible for his blood
 but if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word and your life will be safe
 and the hand of the lord was on me there and he said get up and go out into the valley and there i will have talk with you
 then i got up and went out into the valley and i saw the glory of the lord resting there as i had seen it by the river chebar and i went down on my face
 then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet and he had talk with me and said to me go and keep yourself shut up inside your house
 but see o son of man i will put bands on you prisoning you in them and you will not go out among them
 and i will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them for they are an uncontrolled people
 but when i have talk with you i will make your mouth open and you are to say to them this is what the lord has said let the hearer give ear and as for him who will not let him keep his ears shut for they are an uncontrolled people
 the word of the lord came to me again saying
 son of man be a prophet and say these are the words of the lord give a cry aha for the day 
 for the day is near the day of the lord is near a day of cloud it will be the time of the nations
 and a sword will come on egypt and cruel pain will be in ethiopia when they are falling by the sword in egypt and they will take away her wealth and her bases will be broken down
 ethiopia and put and lud and all the mixed people and libya and the children of the land of the cherethites will all be put to death with them by the sword
 this is what the lord has said the supporters of egypt will have a fall and the pride of her power will come down from migdol to syene they will be put to the sword in it says the lord
 and she will be made waste among the countries which have been made waste and her towns will be among the towns which are unpeopled
 and they will be certain that i am the lord when i have put a fire in egypt and all her helpers are broken
 in that day men will go out quickly to take the news causing fear in untroubled ethiopia and bitter pain will come on them as in the day of egypt for see it is coming
 this is what the lord has said i will put an end to great numbers of the people of egypt by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
 he and the people with him causing fear among the nations will be sent for the destruction of the land their swords will be let loose against egypt and the land will be full of dead
 and i will make the nile streams dry and will give the land into the hands of evil men causing the land and everything in it to be wasted by the hands of men from a strange country i the lord have said it
 this is what the lord has said in addition to this i will give up the images to destruction and put an end to the false gods in noph never again will there be a ruler in the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt
 and i will make pathros a waste and put a fire in zoan and send my punishments on no
 i will let loose my wrath on sin the strong place of egypt cutting off the mass of the people of no
 and i will put a fire in egypt syene will be twisting in pain and no will be broken into as by the onrush of waters
 the young men of on and pi beseth will be put to the sword and these towns will be taken away prisoners
 and at tehaphnehes the day will become dark when the yoke of egypt is broken there and the pride of her power comes to an end as for her she will be covered with a cloud and her daughters will be taken away prisoners
 and i will send my punishments on egypt and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the eleventh year in the first month on the seventh day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man the arm of pharaoh king of egypt has been broken by me and no band has been put round it to make it well no band has been twisted round it to make it strong for gripping the sword
 for this cause the lord has said see i am against pharaoh king of egypt and by me his strong arm will be broken and i will make the sword go out of his hand
 and i will send the egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries
 and i will make the arms of the king of babylon strong and will put my sword in his hand but pharaohs arms will be broken and he will give cries of pain before him like the cries of a man wounded to death
 and i will make the arms of the king of babylon strong and the arms of pharaoh will be hanging down and they will be certain that i am the lord when i put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and it is stretched out against the land of egypt
 and i will send the egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the eleventh year in the third month on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man say to pharaoh king of egypt and to his people whom are you like in your great power
 see a pine tree with beautiful branches and thick growth giving shade and very tall and its top was among the clouds
 it got strength from the waters and the deep made it tall its streams went round about its planted land and it sent out its waterways to all the trees of the field
 in this way it became taller than all the trees of the field and its branches were increased and its arms became long because of the great waters
 in its branches all the birds of heaven came to rest and under its arms all the beasts of the field gave birth to their young and great nations were living in its shade
 so it was beautiful being so tall and its branches so long for its root was by great waters
 no cedars were equal to it in the garden of god the fir trees were not like its branches and plane trees were as nothing in comparison with its arms no tree in the garden of god was so beautiful
 i made it beautiful with its mass of branches so that all the trees in the garden of god were full of envy of it
 for this cause the lord has said because he is tall and has put his top among the clouds and his heart is full of pride because he is so high
 i have given him up into the hands of a strong one of the nations he will certainly give him the reward of his sin driving him out
 and men from strange lands who are to be feared among the nations after cutting him off have let him be on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches have come down his arms are broken by all the waterways of the land all the peoples of the earth have gone from his shade and have let him be
 all the birds of heaven have come to rest on his broken stem where it is stretched on the earth and all the beasts of the field will be on his branches
 in order that no trees by the waters may be lifted up in their growth putting their tops among the clouds and that no trees which are watered may take their place on high for they are all given up to death to the lowest parts of the earth among the children of men with those who go down to the underworld
 this is what the lord has said the day when he goes down to the underworld i will make the deep full of grief for him i will keep back her streams and the great waters will be stopped i will make lebanon dark for him and all the trees of the field will be feeble because of him
 i will send shaking on the nations at the sound of his fall when i send him down to the underworld with those who go down into the deep and on earth they will be comforting themselves all the trees of eden the best of lebanon even all the watered ones
 and they will go down with him to the underworld to those who have been put to the sword even those who were his helpers living under his shade among the nations
 whom then are you like for you will be sent down with the trees of eden into the lowest parts of the earth there you will be stretched out among those without circumcision with those who were put to the sword this is pharaoh and all his people says the lord
 and it came about in the twelfth year in the twelfth month on the first day of the month that the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man make a song of grief for pharaoh king of egypt and say to him young lion of the nations destruction has come on you and you were like a sea beast in the seas sending out bursts of water troubling the waters with your feet making their streams dirty
 this is what the lord has said my net will be stretched out over you and i will take you up in my fishing net
 and i will let you be stretched on the land i will send you out violently into the open field i will let all the birds of heaven come to rest on you and will make the beasts of all the earth full of you
 and i will put your flesh on the mountains and make the valleys full of your blood
 and the land will be watered with your blood and the waterways will be full of you
 and when i put out your life the heaven will be covered and its stars made dark i will let the sun be covered with a cloud and the moon will not give her light
 all the bright lights of heaven i will make dark over you and put dark night on your land says the lord
 and the hearts of numbers of peoples will be troubled when i send your prisoners among the nations into a country which is strange to you
 and i will make a number of peoples overcome with wonder at you and their kings will be full of fear because of you when my sword is waved before them they will be shaking every minute every man fearing for his life in the day of your fall
 for this is what the lord has said the sword of the king of babylon will come on you
 i will let the swords of the strong be the cause of the fall of your people all of them men to be feared among the nations and they will make waste the pride of egypt and all its people will come to destruction
 and i will put an end to all her beasts which are by the great waters and they will never again be troubled by the foot of man or by the feet of beasts
 then i will make their waters clear and their rivers will be flowing like oil says the lord
 when i make egypt an unpeopled waste cutting off from the land all the things in it when i send punishment on all those living in it then it will be clear to them that i am the lord
 it is a song of grief and people will give voice to it the daughters of the nations will give voice to it even for egypt and all her people says the lord
 and in the twelfth year on the fifteenth day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your voice be loud in sorrow for the people of egypt and send them down even you and the daughters of the nations i will send them down into the lowest parts of the earth with those who go down into the underworld
 are you more beautiful than any go down and take your rest among those without circumcision
 among those who have been put to the sword they will give a resting place with them to all their people
 the strong among the great ones will say to him from the underworld are you more beautiful than any go down you and your helpers and take your rest among those without circumcision and those who have been put to the sword
 there is asshur and all her army round about her last resting place all of them put to death by the sword
 whose resting places are in the inmost parts of the underworld who were a cause of fear in the land of the living
 there is elam and all her people round about her last resting place all of them put to death by the sword who have gone down without circumcision into the lowest parts of the earth who were a cause of fear in the land of the living and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld
 they have made a bed for her among the dead and all her people are round about her resting place all of them without circumcision put to death with the sword for they were a cause of fear in the land of the living and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld they have been given a place among those who have been put to the sword
 there is meshech tubal and all her people round about her last resting place all of them without circumcision put to death by the sword for they were a cause of fear in the land of the living
 and they have been put to rest with the fighting men who came to their end in days long past who went down to the underworld with their instruments of war placing their swords under their heads and their body covers are over their bones for their strength was a cause of fear in the land of the living
 but you will have your bed among those without circumcision and will be put to rest with those who have been put to death with the sword
 there is edom her kings and all her princes who have been given a resting place with those who were put to the sword they will be resting among those without circumcision even with those who go down to the underworld
 there are the chiefs of the north all of them and all the zidonians who have gone down with those who have been put to the sword they are shamed on account of all the fear caused by their strength they are resting there without circumcision among those who have been put to the sword and are put to shame with those who go down to the underworld
 pharaoh will see them and be comforted on account of all his people even pharaoh and all his army put to death by the sword says the lord
 for he put his fear in the land of the living and he will be put to rest among those without circumcision with those who have been put to death with the sword even pharaoh and all his people says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man give a word to the children of your people and say to them when i make the sword come on a land if the people of the land take a man from among their number and make him their watchman
 if when he sees the sword coming on the land by sounding the horn he gives the people news of their danger
 then anyone who hearing the sound of the horn does not take note of it will himself be responsible for his death if the sword comes and takes him away
 on hearing the sound of the horn he did not take note his blood will be on him for if he had taken note his life would have been safe
 but if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not give a note on the horn and the people have no word of the danger and the sword comes and takes any person from among them he will be taken away in his sin but i will make the watchman responsible for his blood
 so you son of man i have made you a watchman for the children of israel and you are to give ear to the word of my mouth and give them news from me of their danger
 when i say to the evil doer death will certainly overtake you and you say nothing to make clear to the evil doer the danger of his way death will overtake that evil man in his evil doing but i will make you responsible for his blood
 but if you make clear to the evil doer the danger of his way for the purpose of turning him from it and he is not turned from his way death will overtake him in his evil doing but your life will be safe
 and you son of man say to the children of israel you say our wrongdoing and our sins are on us and we are wasting away in them how then may we have life
 say to them by my life says the lord i have no pleasure in the death of the evil doer it is more pleasing to me if he is turned from his way and has life be turned be turned from your evil ways why are you looking for death o children of israel
 and you son of man say to the children of your people the righteousness of the upright man will not make him safe in the day when he does wrong and the evil doing of the evil man will not be the cause of his fall in the day when he is turned from his evil doing and the upright man will not have life because of his righteousness in the day when he does evil
 when i say to the upright that life will certainly be his if he puts his faith in his righteousness and does evil not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory but in the evil he has done death will overtake him
 and when i say to the evil doer death will certainly be your fate if he is turned from his sin and does what is ordered and right
 if the evil doer lets one who is in his debt have back what is his and gives back what he had taken by force and is guided by the rules of life doing no evil life will certainly be his death will not overtake him
 not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in mind against him he has done what is ordered and right life will certainly be his
 but the children of your people say the way of the lord is not equal when it is they whose way is not equal
 when the upright man turning away from his righteousness does evil death will overtake him in it
 and when the evil man turning away from his evil doing does what is ordered and right he will get life by it
 and still you say the way of the lord is not equal o children of israel i will be your judge giving to everyone the reward of his ways
 now in the twelfth year after we had been taken away prisoners in the tenth month on the fifth day of the month one who had got away in flight from jerusalem came to me saying the town has been taken
 now the hand of the lord had been on me in the evening before the man who had got away came to me and he made my mouth open ready for his coming to me in the morning and my mouth was open and i was no longer without voice
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man those who are living in these waste places in the land of israel say abraham was but one and he had land for his heritage but we are a great number the land is given to us for our heritage
 for this cause say to them this is what the lord has said you take your meat with the blood your eyes are lifted up to your images and you are takers of life are you to have the land for your heritage
 you put your faith in your swords you do disgusting things everyone takes his neighbours wife are you to have the land for your heritage
 this is what you are to say to them the lord has said by my life truly those who are in the waste places will be put to the sword and him who is in the open field i will give to the beasts for their food and those who are in the strong places and in holes in the rocks will come to their death by disease
 and i will make the land a waste and a cause of wonder and the pride of her strength will come to an end and the mountains of israel will be made waste so that no one will go through
 then they will be certain that i am the lord when i have made the land a waste and a cause of wonder because of all the disgusting things which they have done
 and as for you son of man the children of your people are talking together about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses saying to one another come now give ear to the word which comes from the lord
 and they come to you as my people come and are seated before you as my people hearing your words but doing them not for deceit is in their mouth and their heart goes after profit for themselves
 and truly you are to them like a love song by one who has a very pleasing voice and is an expert player on an instrument for they give ear to your words but do them not
 and when this comes about  see it is coming  then it will be clear to them that a prophet has been among them
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man be a prophet against the keepers of the flock of israel and say to them o keepers of the sheep  this is the word of the lord a curse is on the keepers of the flock of israel who take the food for themselves  is it not right for the keepers to give the food to the sheep
 you take the milk and are clothed with the wool you put the fat beasts to death but you give the sheep no food
 you have not made the diseased ones strong or made well that which was ill you have not put bands on the broken or got back that which had been sent away or made search for the wandering ones and the strong you have been ruling cruelly
 and they were wandering in every direction because there was no keeper and they became food for all the beasts of the field
 and my sheep went out of the way wandering through all the mountains and on every high hill my sheep went here and there over all the face of the earth and no one was troubled about them or went in search of them
 for this cause o keepers of the flock give ear to the word of the lord
 by my life says the lord truly because my sheep have been taken away and my sheep became food for all the beasts of the field because there was no keeper and my keepers did not go in search of the sheep but the keepers took food for themselves and gave my sheep no food
 for this reason o you keepers of the flock give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said see i am against the keepers of the flock and i will make search and see what they have done with my sheep and will let them be keepers of my sheep no longer and the keepers will no longer get food for themselves i will take my sheep out of their mouths so that they may not be food for them
 for this is what the lord has said truly i even i will go searching and looking for my sheep
 as the keeper goes looking for his flock when he is among his wandering sheep so i will go looking for my sheep and will get them safely out of all the places where they have been sent wandering in the day of clouds and black night
 and i will take them out from among the peoples and get them together from the countries and will take them into their land and i will give them food on the mountains of israel by the water streams and wherever men are living in the country
 i will give them good grass land for their food and their safe place will be the mountains of the high place of israel there they will take their rest in a good place and on fat grass land they will take their food on the mountains of israel
 i myself will give food to my flock and i will give them rest says the lord
 i will go in search of that which had gone wandering from the way and will get back that which had been sent in flight and will put bands on that which was broken and give strength to that which was ill but the fat and the strong i will give up to destruction i will give them for their food the punishment which is theirs by right
 and as for you o my flock says the lord truly i will be judge between sheep and sheep the he sheep and the he goats
 does it seem a small thing to you to have taken your food on good grass land while the rest of your grass land is stamped down under your feet and that after drinking from clear waters you make the rest of the waters dirty with your feet
 and as for my sheep their food is the grass which has been stamped on by your feet and their drink the water which has been made dirty by your feet
 for this reason the lord has said to them truly i even i will be judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep
 because you have been pushing with side and leg pushing the diseased with your horns till they were sent away in every direction
 i will make my flock safe and they will no longer be taken away and i will be judge between sheep and sheep
 and i will put over them one keeper and he will give them food even my servant david he will give them food and be their keeper
 and i the lord will be their god and my servant david their ruler i the lord have said it
 and i will make with them an agreement of peace and will put an end to evil beasts through all the land and they will be living safely in the waste land sleeping in the woods
 and i will give the rain at the right time and i will make the shower come down at the right time there will be showers of blessing
 and the tree of the field will give its fruit and the earth will give its increase and they will be safe in their land and they will be certain that i am the lord when i have had their yoke broken and have given them salvation from the hands of those who made them servants
 and their goods will no longer be taken by the nations and they will not again be food for the beasts of the earth but they will be living safely and no one will be a cause of fear to them
 and i will give them planting places of peace and they will no longer be wasted from need of food or put to shame by the nations
 and they will be certain that i the lord their god am with them and that they the children of israel are my people says the lord
 and you are my sheep the sheep of my grass lands and i am your god says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to mount seir and be a prophet against it
 and say to it this is what the lord has said see i am against you o mount seir and my hand will be stretched out against you and i will make you a waste and a cause for wonder
 i will make your towns unpeopled and you will be a waste and you will be certain that i am the lord
 because yours has been a hate without end and you have given up the children of israel to the power of the sword in the time of their trouble in the time of the punishment of the end
 for this cause by my life says the lord because you have been sinning through blood blood will come after you
 and i will make mount seir a cause for wonder and a waste cutting off from it all comings and goings
 i will make his mountains full of those who have been put to death in your valleys and in all your water streams men will be falling by the sword
 i will make you waste for ever and your towns will be unpeopled and you will be certain that i am the lord
 because you have said the two nations and the two countries are to be mine and we will take them for our heritage though the lord was there
 for this cause by my life says the lord i will do to you as you have done in your wrath and in your envy which you have made clear in your hate for them and i will make clear to you who i am when you are judged by me
 and you will see that i the lord have had knowledge of all the bitter things which you have said against the mountains of israel saying they have been made waste they are given to us to take for our heritage
 and you have made yourselves great against me with your mouths increasing your words against me and it has come to my ears
 this is what the lord has said because you were glad over my land when it was a waste so will i do to you
 you will become a waste o mount seir and all edom even all of it and you will be certain that i am the lord
 and you son of man be a prophet about the mountains of israel and say you mountains of israel give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said because your hater has said against you aha  and the old waste places are our heritage we have taken them
 for this cause be a prophet and say this is what the lord has said because even because they have been glad over you and put you to shame on every side because you have become a heritage for the rest of the nations and you are taken up on the lips of talkers and in the evil talk of the people
 for this reason you mountains of israel give ear to the word of the lord this is what the lord has said to the mountains and to the hills to the streams and to the valleys to the unpeopled wastes and to the towns where no one is living from which the goods have been taken and which have been put to shame by the rest of the nations who are round about
 for this cause the lord has said truly in the heat of my bitter feeling i have said things against the rest of the nations and against all edom who have taken my land as a heritage for themselves with the joy of all their heart and with bitter envy of soul have made attacks on it
 for this cause be a prophet about the land of israel and say to the mountains and to the hills to the streams and to the valleys this is what the lord has said truly in my bitter feeling and in my wrath i have said these things because you have undergone the shame of the nations
 for this cause the lord has said see i have taken an oath that the nations which are round about you are themselves to undergo the shame which they have put on you
 but you o mountains of israel will put out your branches and give your fruit to my people israel for they are ready to come
 for truly i am for you and i will be turned to you and you will be ploughed and planted
 and i will let your numbers be increased all the children of israel even all of them and the towns will be peopled and the waste places will have buildings
 man and beast will be increased in you and they will have offspring and be fertile i will make you thickly peopled as you were before and will do more for you than at the first and you will be certain that i am the lord
 yes i will have you walked on by the feet of men even my people israel they will have you for a heritage and you will be theirs and never again will you take their children from them
 this is what the lord has said because they say to you you o land are the destruction of men causing loss of children to your nation
 for this reason you will no longer take the lives of men and will never again be the cause of loss of children to your nation says the lord
 and i will not let the shaming of the nations come to your ears and no longer will you be looked down on by the peoples says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man when the children of israel were living in their land they made it unclean by their way and their acts their way before me was as when a woman is unclean at the time when she is kept separate
 so i let loose my wrath on them because of those whom they had violently put to death in the land and because they had made it unclean with their images
 and i sent them in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries i was their judge rewarding them for their way and their acts
 and when they came among the nations wherever they went they made my holy name unclean when it was said of them these are the people of the lord who have gone out from his land
 but i had pity for my holy name which the children of israel had made unclean wherever they went
 for this cause say to the children of israel this is what the lord has said i am doing this not because of you o children of israel but because of my holy name which you have made unclean among the nations wherever you went
 and i will make holy my great name which has been made unclean among the nations which you have made unclean among them and it will be clear to the nations that i am the lord says the lord when i make myself holy in you before their eyes
 for i will take you out from among the nations and get you together from all the countries and take you into your land
 and i will put clean water on you so that you may be clean from all your unclean ways and from all your images i will make you clean
 and i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you i will take away the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh
 and i will put my spirit in you causing you to be guided by my rules and you will keep my orders and do them
 so that you may go on living in the land which i gave to your fathers and you will be to me a people and i will be to you a god
 and i will make you free from all your unclean ways and at my voice the grain will come up and be increased and i will not let you be short of food
 and i will make the tree give more fruit and the field fuller produce and no longer will you be shamed among the nations for need of food
 and at the memory of your evil ways and your wrongdoings you will have bitter hate for yourselves because of your evil doings and your disgusting ways o children of israel
 not because of you am i doing it says the lord let it be clear to you and be shamed and made low because of your ways o children of israel
 this is what the lord has said in the day when i make you clean from all your evil doings i will let the towns be peopled and there will be building on the waste places
 and the land which was waste will be farmed in place of being a waste in the eyes of everyone who went by
 and they will say this land which was waste has become like the garden of eden and the towns which were unpeopled and wasted and pulled down are walled and peopled
 then the rest of the nations round about you will be certain that i the lord am the builder of the places which were pulled down and the planter of that which was waste i the lord have said it and i will do it
 this is what the lord has said the children of israel will again make prayer to me for this that i may do it for them i will make them increased with men like a flock
 like sheep for the offerings like the sheep of jerusalem at her fixed feasts so the unpeopled towns will be made full of men and they will be certain that i am the lord
 the hand of the lord had been on me and he took me out in the spirit of the lord and put me down in the middle of the valley and it was full of bones
 and he made me go past them round about and i saw that there was a very great number of them on the face of the wide valley and they were very dry
 and he said to me son of man is it possible for these bones to come to life and i made answer and said it is for you to say o lord
 and again he said to me be a prophet to these bones and say to them o you dry bones give ear to the word of the lord
 this is what the lord has said to these bones see i will make breath come into you so that you may come to life
 and i will put muscles on you and make flesh come on you and put skin over you and breath into you so that you may have life and you will be certain that i am the lord
 so i gave the word as i was ordered and at my words there was a shaking of the earth and the bones came together bone to bone
 and looking i saw that there were muscles on them and flesh came up and they were covered with skin but there was no breath in them
 and he said to me be a prophet to the wind be a prophet son of man and say to the wind the lord has said come from the four winds o wind breathing on these dead so that they may come to life
 and i gave the word at his orders and breath came into them and they came to life and got up on their feet a very great army
 then he said to me son of man these bones are all the children of israel and see they are saying our bones have become dry our hope is gone we are cut off completely
 for this cause be a prophet to them and say this is what the lord has said see i am opening the resting places of your dead and i will make you come up out of your resting places o my people and i will take you into the land of israel
 and you will be certain that i am the lord by my opening the resting places of your dead and making you come up out of your resting places o my people
 and i will put my spirit in you so that you may come to life and i will give you a rest in your land and you will be certain that i the lord have said it and have done it says the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 and you son of man take one stick writing on it for judah and for the children of israel who are in his company then take another stick writing on it for joseph the stick of ephraim and all the children of israel who are in his company
 then joining them one to another make them one stick so that they may be one in your hand
 and when the children of your people say to you will you not make clear to us what these things have to do with us
 then say to them this is what the lord has said see i am taking the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel who are in his company and i will put it on the stick of judah and make them one stick and they will be one in my hand
 and the sticks with your writing on them will be in your hand before their eyes
 and say to them these are the words of the lord see i am taking the children of israel from among the nations where they have gone and will get them together on every side and take them into their land
 and i will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of israel and one king will be king over them all and they will no longer be two nations and will no longer be parted into two kingdoms
 and they will no longer make themselves unclean with their images or with their hated things or with any of their sins but i will give them salvation from all their turning away in which they have done evil and will make them clean and they will be to me a people and i will be to them a god
 and my servant david will be king over them and they will all have one keeper and they will be guided by my orders and will keep my rules and do them
 and they will be living in the land which i gave to jacob my servant in which your fathers were living and they will go on living there they and their children and their childrens children for ever and david my servant will be their ruler for ever
 and i will make an agreement of peace with them it will be an eternal agreement with them and i will have mercy on them and make their numbers great and will put my holy place among them for ever
 and my house will be over them and i will be to them a god and they will be to me a people
 and the nations will be certain that i who make israel holy am the lord when my holy place is among them for ever
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned against gog of the land of magog the ruler of rosh meshech and tubal and be a prophet against him
 and say this is what the lord has said see i am against you o gog ruler of rosh meshech and tubal
 and turning you round i will put hooks in your mouth and make you come out with all your army horses and horsemen all of them in full war dress a great force with breastplate and body cover all of them armed with swords

 after a long time you will get your orders in the last years you will come into the land which has been given back from the sword which has been got together out of a great number of peoples on the mountains of israel which have ever been a waste but it has been taken out from the peoples and they will be living all of them without fear of danger
 and you will go up you will come like a storm you will be like a cloud covering the land you and all your forces and a great number of peoples with you
 this is what the lord has said in that day it will come about that things will come into your mind and you will have thoughts of an evil design
 and you will say i will go up to the land of small unwalled towns i will go to those who are quiet living all of them without fear of danger without walls or locks or doors
 to take their property by force and go off with their goods turning your hand against the waste places which now are peopled and against the people who have been got together out of the nations who have got cattle and goods for themselves who are living in the middle of the earth
 sheba and dedan and her traders tarshish with all her traders will say to you have you come to take our goods have you got your armies together to take away our property by force to take away silver and gold cattle and goods to go off with great wealth
 for this cause son of man be a prophet and say to gog these are the words of the lord in that day when my people israel are living without fear of danger will you not be moved against them
 and you will come from your place in the inmost parts of the north you and a great number of peoples with you all of them on horseback a great force and a strong army
 and you will come up against my people israel like a cloud covering the land and it will come about in the last days that i will make you come against my land so that the nations may have knowledge of me when i make myself holy in you o gog before their eyes
 this is what the lord has said you are he of whom i gave them word in earlier times by my servants the prophets of israel who in those days went on saying year after year that i would make you come up against them
 and it will come about in that day when gog comes up against the land of israel says the lord that my wrath will come up and my passion and my bitter feeling
 for in the fire of my wrath i have said truly in that day there will be a great shaking in the land of israel
 so that the fish of the sea and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the field and everything moving on the earth and all the men who are on the face of the earth will be shaking before me and the mountains will be overturned and the high places will come down and every wall will come falling down to the earth
 and i will send to all my mountains for a sword against him says the lord every mans sword will be against his brother
 and i will take up my cause against him with disease and with blood and i will send down on him and on his forces and on the peoples who are with him an overflowing shower and great ice drops fire and burning
 and i will make my name great and make myself holy and i will make myself clear to a number of nations and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and you son of man be a prophet against gog and say these are the words of the lord see i am against you o gog ruler of rosh meshech and tubal
 and turning you round i will be your guide and make you come up from the inmost parts of the north i will make you come on to the mountains of israel
 and with a blow i will send your bow out of your left hand and your arrows falling from your right hand
 on the mountains of israel you will come down you and all your forces and the peoples who are with you i will give you to cruel birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be their food
 you will come down in the open field for i have said it says the lord
 and i will send a fire on magog and on those who are living in the sea lands without fear and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and i will make clear my holy name among my people israel i will no longer let my holy name be made unclean and the nations will be certain that i am the lord the holy one in israel
 see it is coming and it will be done says the lord this is the day of which i have given word
 and those who are living in the towns of israel will go out and make fires of the instruments of war burning the body covers and the breastplates the bows and the arrows and the sticks and the spears and for seven years they will make fires of them
 and they will take no wood out of the field or have any cut down in the woods for they will make their fires of the instruments of war and they will take by force the property of those who took their property and go off with the goods of those who took their goods says the lord
 and it will come about in those days that i will give to gog a last resting place there in israel in the valley of abarim on the east of the sea and those who go through will be stopped and there gog and all his people will be put to rest and the place will be named the valley of hamon gog
 and the children of israel will be seven months putting them in the earth so as to make the land clean
 and all the people of the land will put them in the earth and it will be to their honour in the day when i let my glory be seen says the lord
 and they will put on one side men to do no other work but to go through the land and put in the earth the rest of those who are still on the face of the land to make it clean after seven months are ended they are to make a search
 and while they go through the land if anyone sees a mans bone he is to put up a sign by the place till those who are doing the work have put it in the earth in the valley of hamon gog
 and there they will put all the army of gog in the earth so they will make the land clean
 and you son of man this is what the lord has said say to the birds of every sort and to all the beasts of the field get together and come come together on every side to the offering which i am putting to death for you a great offering on the mountains of israel so that you may have flesh for your food and blood for your drink
 the flesh of the men of war will be your food and your drink the blood of the princes of the earth of sheep and lambs of he goats of oxen all of them fat beasts of bashan
 you will go on feasting on the fat till you are full and drinking the blood till you are overcome with it of my offering which i have put to death for you
 at my table you will have food in full measure horses and war carriages great men and all the men of war says the lord
 and i will put my glory among the nations and all the nations will see my punishments which i have put into effect and my hand which i have put on them
 so the children of israel will be certain that i am the lord their god from that day and for the future
 and it will be clear to the nations that the children of israel were taken away prisoners for their evil doing because they did wrong against me and my face was covered from them so i gave them up into the hands of their attackers and they all came to their end by the sword
 in the measure of their unclean ways and their sins so i did to them and i kept my face covered from them
 for this cause the lord has said now i will let the fate of jacob be changed and i will have mercy on all the children of israel and will take care of the honour of my holy name
 and they will be conscious of their shame and of all the wrong which they have done against me when they are living in their land with no sense of danger and with no one to be a cause of fear to them
 when i have taken them back from among the peoples and got them together out of the lands of their haters and have made myself holy in them before the eyes of a great number of nations
 and they will be certain that i am the lord their god because i sent them away as prisoners among the nations and have taken them together back to their land and i have not let one of them be there any longer
 and my face will no longer be covered from them for i have sent the out flowing of my spirit on the children of israel says the lord
 and you son of man take a back and put it before you and on it make a picture of a town even jerusalem
 and make an attack on it shutting it in building strong places against it and making high an earthwork against it and put up tents against it placing engines all round it for smashing down its walls
 and take a flat iron plate and put it for a wall of iron between you and the town and let your face be turned to it and it will be shut in and you will make an attack on it this will be a sign to the children of israel
 then stretching yourself out on your left side take the sin of the children of israel on yourself for as long as you are stretched out so long will the sin of the children of israel be on you
 for i have had the years of their sin measured for you by a number of days even three hundred and ninety days and you will take on yourself the sin of the children of israel
 and when these days are ended turning on your right side you are to take on yourself the sin of the children of judah forty days a day for a year i have had it fixed for you
 and let your face be turned to where jerusalem is shut in with your arm uncovered and be a prophet against it
 and see i will put bands on you and you will be stretched out without turning from one side to the other till the days of your attack are ended
 and take for yourself wheat and barley and different sorts of grain and put them in one vessel and make bread for yourself from them all the days when you are stretched on your side it will be your food
 and you are to take your food by weight twenty shekels a day you are to take it at regular times
 and you are to take water by measure the sixth part of a hin you are to take it at regular times
 and let your food be barley cakes cooking it before their eyes with the waste which comes out of a man
 and the lord said even so the children of israel will have unclean bread for their food among the nations where i am driving them
 then i said ah lord  see my soul has never been unclean and i have never taken as my food anything which has come to a natural death or has been broken by beasts from the time when i was young even till now no disgusting flesh has ever come into my mouth
 then he said to me see i have given you cows waste in place of mans waste and you will make your bread ready on it
 and he said to me son of man see i will take away from jerusalem her necessary bread they will take their bread by weight and with care measuring out their drinking water with fear and wonder
 so that they may be in need of bread and water and be wondering at one another wasting away in their sin
 in the twenty fifth year after we had been taken away prisoners in the first month of the year on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after the town was taken on the very same day the hand of the lord was on me and he took me there
 in the visions of god he took me into the land of israel and put me down on a very high mountain on which there was as it seemed a building like a town opposite me
 he took me there and i saw a man looking like brass with a linen cord in his hand and a measuring rod and he was stationed in the doorway
 and the man said to me son of man see with your eyes and give hearing with your ears and take to heart everything i am going to let you see for in order that i might let you see them you have come here and give an account of all you see to the children of israel

 and the room facing north is for the priests who have the care of the altar these are the sons of zadok who from among the sons of levi come near to the lord to do the work of his house
 and he took the measure of the open square a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide being square and the altar was in front of the house

 when the priests go in they may not go out of the holy place into the outer square and there they are to put the robes in which they do the work of the lords house for they are holy and they have to put on other clothing before they come near that which has to do with the people

 and he took me to the doorway looking to the east
 and there was the glory of the god of israel coming from the way of the east and his voice was like the sound of great waters and the earth was shining with his glory
 and the vision which i saw was like the vision i had seen when he came for the destruction of the town and like the vision which i saw by the river chebar and i went down on my face
 and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the doorway looking to the east
 and the spirit lifting me up took me into the inner square and i saw that the house was full of the glory of the lord
 and the voice of one talking to me came to my ears from inside the house and the man was by my side
 and he said to me son of man this is the place where the seat of my power is and the resting place of my feet where i will be among the children of israel for ever and no longer will the people of israel make my holy name unclean they or their kings by their loose ways and by the dead bodies of their kings
 by putting their doorstep by my doorstep and the pillar of their door by the pillar of my door with only a wall between me and them and they have made my holy name unclean by the disgusting things which they have done so in my wrath i sent destruction on them
 now let them put their loose ways and the dead bodies of their kings far from me and i will be among them for ever
 you son of man give the children of israel an account of this house so that they may be shamed because of their evil doing and let them see the vision of it and its image
 and they will be shamed by what they have done so give them the knowledge of the form of the house and its structure and the ways out of it and into it and all its laws and its rules writing it down for them so that they may keep all its laws and do them
 this is the law of the house on the top of the mountain all the space round it on every side will be most holy see this is the law of the house
 and these are the measures of the altar in cubits  the cubit being a cubit and a hands measure  its hollow base is a cubit high and a cubit wide and it has an overhanging edge as wide as a hand stretch all round it
 and from the base on the earth level to the lower shelf the altar is two cubits high and a cubit wide and from the smaller shelf to the greater shelf it is four cubits high and a cubit wide
 and the fireplace is four cubits high and coming up from the fireplace are the horns a cubit high
 and the fireplace is twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide square on its four sides
 and the shelf is fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide on its four sides the edge round it is half a cubit the base of it is a cubit all round and its steps are facing the east
 and he said to me son of man the lord god has said these are the rules for the altar when they make it for the offering of burned offerings on it and the draining out of the blood
 you are to give to the priests the levites of the seed of zadok who come near to me says the lord god to do my work a young ox for a sin offering
 you are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns and on the four angles of the shelf and on the edge all round and you are to make it clean and free from sin
 and you are to take the ox of the sin offering and have it burned in the special place ordered for it in the house outside the holy place
 and on the second day you are to have a he goat without any mark on it offered for a sin offering and they are to make the altar clean as they did with the young ox
 and after you have made it clean let a young ox without a mark be offered and a male sheep from the flock without a mark
 and you are to take them before the lord and the priests will put salt on them offering them up for a burned offering to the lord
 every day for seven days you are to give a goat for a sin offering and let them give in addition a young ox and a male sheep from the flock without any mark on them
 for seven days they are to make offerings to take away sin from the altar and to make it clean so they are to make it holy
 and when these days have come to an end then on the eighth day and after the priests will make your burned offerings on the altar and your peace offerings and i will take pleasure in you says the lord
 and he took me back to the outer doorway of the holy place looking to the east and it was shut
 and the lord said to me this doorway is to be shut it is not to be open and no man is to go in by it because the lord the god of israel has gone in by it and it is to be shut
 but the ruler will be seated there to take his food before the lord he will go in by the covered way to the door and will come out by the same way
 and he took me to the north doorway in front of the house and looking i saw that the house of the lord was full of the glory of the lord and i went down on my face
 and the lord said to me son of man take to heart and let your eyes see and your ears be open to everything i say to you about all the rules of the house of the lord and all its laws and take note of the ways into the house and all the ways out of the holy place
 and say to the uncontrolled children of israel this is what the lord has said o you children of israel let it be enough for you among the disgusting things which you have done
 to have let men from strange lands without circumcision of heart or flesh come into my holy place making my house unclean and to have made the offering of my food even the fat and the blood and in addition to all your disgusting ways you have let my agreement be broken
 and you have not taken care of my holy things but you have put them as keepers to take care of my work in my holy place
 for this cause the lord has said no man from a strange land without circumcision of heart and flesh of all those who are living among the children of israel is to come into my holy place
 but as for the levites who went far from me when israel went out of the right way turning away from me to go after their images their punishment will come on them
 but they may be caretakers in my holy place and overseers at the doors of the house doing the work of the house they will put to death the burned offering and the beasts offered for the people and they will take their place before them as their servants
 because they did this work for them before their images and became a cause of sin to the children of israel for this cause my hand has been lifted up against them says the lord and their punishment will be on them
 and they will not come near me to do the work of priests to me or come near any of my holy things or the things which are most holy but their shame will be on them and the punishment for the disgusting things which they have done
 but i will make them responsible for the care of the house and all its work and everything which is done in it
 but as for the priests the sons of zadok who took care of my holy place when the children of israel were turned away from me they are to come near me to do my work they will take their places before me offering to me the fat and the blood says the lord
 they are to come into my holy place and they are to come near to my table to do my work and have the care of my house
 and when they come in by the doorways of the inner square they are to be clothed in linen robes there is to be no wool on them while they are doing my work in the doorway of the inner square and inside the house
 they are to have linen head dresses on their heads and linen trousers on their legs and they are to have nothing round them to make their skin wet with heat
 and when they go out into the outer square to the people they are to take off the robes in which they do the work of priests and put them away in the holy rooms and put on other clothing so that the people may not be made holy by their robes

 and after he has been made clean seven days are to be numbered for him
 and on the day when he goes into the inner square to do the work of the holy place he is to make his sin offering says the lord
 and they are to have no heritage i am their heritage you are to give them no property in israel i am their property

 and when you are making a distribution of the land by the decision of the lord for your heritage you are to make an offering to the lord of a part of the land as holy it is to be twenty five thousand long and twenty thousand wide all the land inside these limits is to be holy
 of this a square five hundred long and five hundred wide is to be for the holy place with a space of fifty cubits all round it
 and of this measure let a space be measured twenty five thousand long and ten thousand wide in it there will be the holy place even the most holy
 this holy part of the land is to be for the priests the servants of the holy place who come near to the lord to do his work it is to be a place for their houses and for grass land and for cattle

 and for the ruler there is to be a part on one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the property of the town in front of the holy offering and in front of the property of the town on the west of it and on the east measured in the same line as one of the parts of the land from its limit on the west to its limit on the east of the land
 and this will be his heritage in israel and my rulers will no longer be cruel masters to my people but they will give the land as a heritage to the children of israel by their tribes
 this is what the lord has said let this be enough for you o rulers of israel let there be an end of violent behaviour and wasting do what is right judging uprightly let there be no more driving out of my people says the lord

 this is what the lord has said in the first month on the first day of the month you are to take a young ox without any mark on him and you are to make the holy place clean
 and the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the uprights at the sides of the doors of the house and on the four angles of the shelf of the altar and on the sides of the doorway of the inner square

 in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month you are to have the passover a feast of seven days unleavened bread is to be your food
 and on that day the ruler is to give for himself and for all the people of the land an ox for a sin offering
 and on the seven days of the feast he is to give a burned offering to the lord seven oxen and seven sheep without any mark on them every day for seven days and a he goat every day for a sin offering

 this is what the lord has said the doorway of the inner square looking to the east is to be shut on the six working days but on the sabbath it is to be open and at the time of the new moon it is to be open
 and the ruler is to go in through the covered way of the outer doorway outside and take his place by the pillar of the doorway and the priests will make his burned offering and his peace offerings and he will give worship at the doorstep of the doorway then he will go out and the door will not be shut till the evening
 and the people of the land are to give worship at the door of that doorway before the lord on the sabbaths and at the new moons

 and when the ruler comes in he is to go in through the covered way of the doorway and he is to go out by the same way
 but when the people of the land come before the lord at the fixed feasts he who comes in by the north doorway to give worship is to go out by the south doorway and he who comes in by the south doorway is to go out by the north doorway he is not to come back by the doorway through which he went in but is to go straight before him
 and the ruler when they come in is to come among them and is to go out when they go out
 at the feasts and the fixed meetings the meal offerings are to be an ephah for an ox and an ephah for a male sheep and for the lambs whatever he is able to give and a hin of oil to an ephah

 and they are to give the lamb and the meal offering and the oil morning by morning for a burned offering at all times
 this is what the lord has said if the ruler gives a property to any of his sons it is his heritage and will be the property of his sons it is theirs for their heritage
 and if he gives a part of his heritage to one of his servants it will be his till the year of making free and then it will go back to the ruler for it is his sons heritage and is to be theirs
 and the ruler is not to take the heritage of any of the people driving them out of their property he is to give a heritage to his sons out of the property which is his so that my people may not be sent away from their property
 and he took me through by the way in at the side of the doorway into the holy rooms which are the priests looking to the north and i saw a place at the side of them to the west
 and he said to me this is the place where the offering for error and the sin offering are to be cooked in water by the priests and where the meal offering is to be cooked in the oven so that they may not be taken out into the outer square to make the people holy
 and he took me out into the outer square and made me go by the four angles of the square and i saw that in every angle of the open square there was a space shut in
 in the four angles there were spaces walled in forty cubits long and thirty wide the four were of the same size
 and there was a line of wall all round inside them round all four and boiling places were made under it all round about
 and he said to me these are the boiling rooms where the offering of the people is cooked by the servants of the house
 and he took me back to the door of the house and i saw that waters were flowing out from under the doorstep of the house on the east for the house was facing east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house on the south side of the altar
 and he took me out by the north doorway and made me go round to the outside of the doorway looking to the east and i saw waters running slowly out on the south side
 and the man went out to the east with the line in his hand and after measuring a thousand cubits he made me go through the waters which came over my feet
 and again measuring a thousand cubits he made me go through the waters which came up to my knees again measuring a thousand he made me go through the waters up to the middle of my body
 again after his measuring a thousand it became a river which it was not possible to go through for the waters had become deep enough for swimming a river it was not possible to go through
 and he said to me son of man have you seen this then he took me to the rivers edge
 and he took me back and i saw at the edge of the river a very great number of trees on this side and on that
 and he said to me these waters are flowing out to the east part of the land and down into the arabah and they will go to the sea and the waters will be made sweet
 and it will come about that every living and moving thing wherever their streams come will have life and there will be very much fish because these waters have come there and have been made sweet and everything wherever the river comes will have life
 and fishermen will take up their places by it from en gedi as far as en eglaim will be a place for the stretching out of nets the fish will be of every sort like the fish of the great sea a very great number
 the wet places and the pools will not be made sweet they will be given up to salt
 and by the edge of the river on this side and on that will come up every tree used for food whose leaves will ever be green and its fruit will not come to an end it will have new fruit every month because its waters come out from the holy place the fruit will be for food and the leaf will make well those who are ill

 and you son of man take a sharp sword using it like a haircutters blade and making it go over your head and the hair of your chin and take scales for separating the hair by weight
 you are to have a third part burned with fire inside the town when the days of the attack are ended and a third part you are to take and give blows with the sword round about it and give a third part for the wind to take away and let loose a sword after them
 and take from them a small number of hairs folding them in your skirts
 and again take some of these and put them in the fire burning them up in the fire and say to all the children of israel
 this is what the lord has said this is jerusalem i have put her among the nations and countries are round her on every side
 and she has gone against my orders by doing evil more than the nations and against my rules more than the countries round her for they have given up my orders and as for my rules they have not gone in the way of them
 for this cause the lord has said because you have been more uncontrolled than the nations round about you and have not been guided by my rules or kept my orders but have kept the orders of the nations round about you
 for this cause the lord has said see i even i am against you and i will be judging among you before the eyes of the nations
 and i will do in you what i have not done and will not do again because of all your disgusting ways
 for this cause fathers will take their sons for food among you and sons will make a meal of their fathers and i will be judge among you and all the rest of you i will send away to every wind
 for this cause by my life says the lord because you have made my holy place unclean with all your hated things and all your disgusting ways you will become disgusting to me my eye will have no mercy and i will have no pity
 a third of you will come to death from disease wasting away among you through need of food a third will be put to the sword round about you and a third i will send away to every wind letting loose a sword after them
 so my wrath will be complete and my passion will come to rest on them and they will be certain that i the lord have given the word of decision when my wrath against them is complete
 and i will make you a waste and a name of shame among the nations round about you in the eyes of everyone who goes by
 and you will be a name of shame and a cause of bitter words an example and a wonder to the nations round about you when i give effect to my judging among you in wrath and in passion and in burning protests i the lord have said it
 when i send on you the evil arrows of disease causing destruction which i will send to put an end to you and further i will take away your necessary food
 and i will send on you need of food and evil beasts and they will be a cause of loss to you and disease and violent death will go through you and i will send the sword on you i the lord have said it
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 son of man let your face be turned to the mountains of israel and be a prophet to them and say
 you mountains of israel give ear to the words of the lord this is what the lord has said to the mountains and the hills to the waterways and the valleys see i even i am sending on you a sword for the destruction of your high places
 and your altars will be made waste and your sun images will be broken and i will have your dead men placed before your images
 and i will put the dead bodies of the children of israel in front of their images sending your bones in all directions about your altars
 in all your living places the towns will become broken walls and the high places made waste so that your altars may be broken down and made waste and your images broken and ended and so that your sun images may be cut down and your works rubbed out
 and the dead will be falling down among you and you will be certain that i am the lord
 but still i will keep a small band safe from the sword among the nations when you are sent wandering among the countries
 and those of you who are kept safe will have me in mind among the nations where they have been taken away as prisoners how i sent punishment on their hearts which were untrue to me and on their eyes which were turned to their false gods and they will be full of hate for themselves because of the evil things which they have done in all their disgusting ways
 and they will be certain that i am the lord not for nothing did i say that i would do this evil to them
 this is what the lord has said give blows with your hand stamping with your foot and say o sorrow  because of all the evil and disgusting ways of the children of israel for death will overtake them by the sword and through need of food and by disease
 he who is far away will come to his death by disease he who is near will be put to the sword he who is shut up will come to his death through need of food and i will give full effect to my passion against them
 and you will be certain that i am the lord when their dead men are stretched among their images round about their altars on every high hill on all the tops of the mountains and under every branching tree and under every thick oak tree the places where they made sweet smells to all their images
 and my hand will be stretched out against them making the land waste and unpeopled from the waste land to riblah through all their living places and they will be certain that i am the lord
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 and you son of man say this is what the lord has said to the land of israel an end has come the end has come on the four quarters of the land
 now the end has come on you and i will send my wrath on you judging you for your ways i will send punishment on you for all your disgusting acts
 my eye will not have mercy on you and i will have no pity but i will send the punishment of your ways on you and your disgusting works will be among you and you will be certain that i am the lord
 this is what the lord has said an evil even one evil see it is coming
 an end has come the end has come see it is coming on you
 the crowning time has come on you o people of the land the time has come the day is near the day will not be slow in coming it will not keep back
 now in a little time i will let loose my passion on you and give full effect to my wrath against you judging you for your ways and sending punishment on you for all your disgusting works
 my eye will not have mercy and i will have no pity i will send on you the punishment of your ways and your disgusting works will be among you and you will see that i am the lord who gives punishment
 see the day see it is coming the crowning time has gone out the twisted way is flowering pride has put out buds
 violent behaviour has been lifted up into a rod of evil it will not be slow in coming it will not keep back
 the time has come the day is near let not him who gives a price for goods be glad or him who gets the price have sorrow
 for the trader will not go back to the things for which he had his price even while he is still living
 and he who has given a price for goods will not get them for my wrath is on all of them
 outside is the sword and inside disease and need of food he who is in the open country will be put to the sword he who is in the town will come to his end through need of food and disease
 and those of them who get away safely will go and be in the secret places like the doves of the valleys all of them will come to death every one in his sin
 all hands will be feeble and all knees without strength like water
 and they will put haircloth round them and deep fear will be covering them and shame will be on all faces and the hair gone from all their heads
 they will put out their silver into the streets and their gold will be as an unclean thing their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the wrath of the lord they will not get their desire or have food for their need because it has been the cause of their falling into sin
 as for their beautiful ornament they had put it on high and had made the images of their disgusting and hated things in it for this cause i have made it an unclean thing to them
 and i will give it into the hands of men from strange lands who will take it by force and to the evil doers of the earth to have for themselves and they will make it unholy
 and my face will be turned away from them and they will make my secret place unholy violent men will go into it and make it unholy
 make the chain for the land is full of crimes of blood and the town is full of violent acts
 for this reason i will send the worst of the nations and they will take their houses for themselves i will make the pride of their strength come to an end and their holy places will be made unclean
 shaking fear is coming and they will be looking for peace and there will be no peace
 destruction will come on destruction and one story after another and the vision of the prophet will be shamed and knowledge of the law will come to an end among the priests and wisdom among the old
 the king will give himself up to sorrow and the ruler will be clothed with wonder and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled i will give them punishment for their ways judging them as it is right for them to be judged and they will be certain that i am the lord
 now in the sixth year in the sixth month on the fifth day of the month when i was in my house and the responsible men of judah were seated before me the hand of the lord came on me there
 and looking i saw a form like fire from the middle of his body and down there was fire and up from the middle of his body a sort of shining like electrum
 and he put out the form of a hand and took me by the hair of my head and the wind lifting me up between the earth and the heaven took me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the way into the inner door facing to the north where was the seat of the image of envy
 and i saw the glory of the lord there as in the vision which i saw in the valley
 then he said to me son of man now let your eyes be lifted up in the direction of the north and on looking in the direction of the north to the north of the doorway of the altar i saw this image of envy by the way in
 and he said to me son of man do you see what they are doing even the very disgusting things which the children of israel are doing here causing me to go far away from my holy place but you will see other most disgusting things
 and he took me to the door of the open place and looking i saw a hole in the wall
 and he said to me son of man make a hole in the wall and after making a hole in the wall i saw a door
 and he said to me go in and see the evil and disgusting things which they are doing here
 so i went in and saw and there every sort of living thing which goes flat on the earth and unclean beasts and all the images of the children of israel were pictured round about on the wall
 and before them seventy of the responsible men of the children of israel had taken their places every man with a vessel for burning perfumes in his hand and in the middle of them was jaazaniah the son of shaphan and a cloud of smoke went up from the burning perfume
 and he said to me son of man have you seen what the responsible men of the children of israel do in the dark every man in his room of pictured images for they say the lord does not see us the lord has gone away from the land
 then he said to me you will see even more disgusting things which they do
 then he took me to the door of the way into the lords house looking to the north and there women were seated weeping for tammuz
 then he said to me have you seen this o son of man you will see even more disgusting things than these
 and he took me into the inner square of the lords house and at the door of the temple of the lord between the covered way and the altar there were about twenty five men with their backs turned to the temple of the lord and their faces turned to the east and they were worshipping the sun turning to the east
 then he said to me have you seen this o son of man is it a small thing to the children of judah that they do the disgusting things which they are doing here for they have made the land full of violent behaviour making me angry again and again and see they put the branch to my nose
 for this reason i will let loose my wrath my eye will not have mercy and i will have no pity
 then crying out in my hearing in a loud voice he said let the overseers of the town come near every man armed
 and six men came from the way of the higher doorway looking to the north every man with his axe in his hand and one man among them was clothed in linen with a writers inkpot at his side and they went in and took their places by the brass altar
 and the glory of the god of israel had gone up from the winged ones on which it was resting to the doorstep of the house and crying out to the man clothed in linen who had the writers inkpot at his side
 the lord said to him go through the town through the middle of jerusalem and put a mark on the brows of the men who are sorrowing and crying for all the disgusting things which are done in it
 and to these he said in my hearing go through the town after him using your axes do not let your eyes have mercy and have no pity
 give up to destruction old men and young men and virgins little children and women but do not come near any man who has the mark on him and make a start at my holy place so they made a start with the old men who were before the house
 and he said to them make the house unclean make the open places full of dead go forward and send destruction on the town
 now while they were doing so and i was untouched i went down on my face and crying out i said ah lord  will you give all the rest of israel to destruction in letting loose your wrath on jerusalem
 then he said to me the sin of the children of israel and judah is very very great and the land is full of blood and the town full of evil ways for they say the lord has gone away from the land and the lord does not see
 and as for me my eye will not have mercy and i will have no pity but i will send the punishment of their ways on their heads
 then the man clothed in linen who had the inkpot at his side came back and said i have done what you gave me orders to do
 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia in order that the word of the lord given by the mouth of jeremiah might come true the spirit of cyrus king of persia was moved by the lord so that he made a public statement through all his kingdom and put it in writing saying
 these are the words of cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in jerusalem which is in judah
 whoever there is among you of his people may his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and take in hand the building of the house of the lord the god of israel he is the god who is in jerusalem
 and whoever there may be of the rest of israel living in any place let the men of that place give him help with offerings of silver and gold and goods and beasts in addition to the offering freely given for the house of god in jerusalem
 then the heads of families of judah and benjamin with the priests and the levites got ready even all those whose spirits were moved by god to go up and take in hand the building of the lords house in jerusalem
 and all their neighbours gave them help with offerings of vessels of silver and gold and goods and beasts and things of great value in addition to what was freely offered
 and cyrus the king got out the vessels of the house of the lord which nebuchadnezzar had taken from jerusalem and put in the house of his gods
 even these cyrus made mithredath the keeper of his wealth get out and he gave them after numbering them to sheshbazzar the ruler of judah
 and this is the number of them there were thirty gold plates a thousand silver plates twenty nine knives
 thirty gold basins four hundred and ten silver basins and a thousand other vessels
 there were five thousand four hundred gold and silver vessels all these were taken back by sheshbazzar when those who had been taken prisoner went up from babylon to jerusalem
 now while ezra was making his prayer and his statement of wrongdoing weeping and falling down before the house of god a very great number of men and women and children out of israel came together round him for the people were weeping bitterly
 and shecaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answering said to ezra we have done evil against our god and have taken as our wives strange women of the peoples of the land but still there is hope for israel in this question
 let us now make an agreement with our god to put away all the wives and all their children if it seems right to my lord and to those who go in fear of the words of our god and let it be done in keeping with the law
 up now  for this is your business and we are with you take heart and do it
 then ezra got up and made the chiefs of the priests and the levites and all israel take an oath that they would do this so they took an oath
 then ezra got up from before the house of god and went into the room of jehohanan the son of eliashib but when he came there he took no food or drink for he was sorrowing for the sin of those who had come back
 and they made a public statement through all judah and jerusalem to all those who had come back that they were to come together to jerusalem
 and that if anyone did not come before three days were past as ordered by the rulers and the responsible men all his goods would be put under the curse and he himself would be cut off from the meeting of the people who had come back
 then all the men of judah and benjamin came together to jerusalem before three days were past it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people were seated in the wide square in front of the house of god shaking with fear because of this business and because of the great rain
 and ezra the priest got to his feet and said to them you have done wrong and taken strange women for your wives so increasing the sin of israel
 so now give praise to the lord the god of your fathers and do his pleasure and make yourselves separate from the peoples of the land and from the strange women
 then all the people answering said with a loud voice as you have said so it is right for us to do
 but the number of people is great and it is a time of much rain it is not possible for us to go on waiting outside and this is not a thing which may be done in one day or even two for our sin in this business is great
 so now let our rulers be representatives for all the people and let all those in our towns who are married to strange women come at fixed times and with them the responsible men and the judges of every town till the burning wrath of our god is turned away from us and this has been done
 only jonathan the son of asahel and jahzeiah the son of tikvah were against this meshullam and shabbethai the levite supporting them
 so those who had come back did so and ezra the priest with certain heads of families by their fathers families all of them by their names were marked out and on the first day of the tenth month they took their places to go into the question with care
 and they got to the end of all the men who were married to strange women by the first day of the first month
 and among the sons of the priests who were married to strange women were these of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brothers maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah
 and they gave their word that they would put away their wives and for their sin they gave an offering of a male sheep of the flock
 and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah
 and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah and jehiel and uzziah
 and of the sons of pashhur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethanel jozabad and elasah

 all these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by whom they had offspring
 now these are the people of the divisions of the kingdom among those who had been made prisoners by nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and taken away to babylon who went back to jerusalem and judah everyone to his town

 all the nethinim and the children of solomons servants were three hundred and ninety two
 and these were the people who went up from tel melah tel harsha cherub addan and immer but having no knowledge of their fathers families or offspring it was not certain that they were israelites
 the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred and fifty two
 and of the children of the priests the children of habaiah the children of hakkoz the children of barzillai who was married to one of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and took their name
 they made search for their record among the lists of families but their names were nowhere to be seen so they were looked on as unclean and no longer priests
 and the tirshatha said that they were not to have the most holy things for their food till a priest came to give decision by urim and thummim
 the number of all the people together was forty two thousand three hundred and sixty
 as well as their men servants and their women servants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven and they had two hundred men and women to make music
 they had seven hundred and thirty six horses two hundred and forty five transport beasts
 four hundred and thirty five camels six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
 and some of the heads of families when they came to the house of the lord which is in jerusalem gave freely of their wealth for the building up of the house of god in its place
 every one as he was able gave for the work sixty one thousand darics of gold five thousand pounds of silver and a hundred priests robes
 so the priests and the levites and the people and the music makers and the door keepers and the nethinim took up their places in their towns even all israel in their towns
 and when the seventh month came and the children of israel were in the towns the people came together like one man to jerusalem
 then jeshua the son of jozadak and his brothers the priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel with his brothers got up and made the altar of the god of israel for burned offerings as is recorded in the law of moses the man of god
 they put the altar on its base for fear was on them because of the people of the countries and they made burned offerings on it to the lord even burned offerings morning and evening
 and they kept the feast of tents as it is recorded making the regular burned offerings every day by number as it is ordered for every day what was needed
 and after that the regular burned offering and the offerings for the new moons and all the fixed feasts of the lord which had been made holy and the offering of everyone who freely gave his offering to the lord
 from the first day of the seventh month they made a start with the burned offerings but the base of the temple of the lord had still not been put in its place
 and they gave money to the stoneworkers and woodworkers and meat and drink and oil to the people of zidon and of tyre for the transport of cedar trees from lebanon to the sea to joppa as cyrus king of persia had given them authority to do
 now in the second year of their coming into the house of god in jerusalem in the second month the work was taken in hand by zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the levites and all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to jerusalem and they made the levites of twenty years old and over responsible for overseeing the work of the house of the lord
 then jeshua with his sons and his brothers kadmiel with his sons the sons of hodaviah together took up the work of overseeing the workmen in the house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brothers the levites
 and when the builders put in position the base of the temple of the lord the priests dressed in their robes took their places with horns and the levites the sons of asaph with brass instruments to give praise to the lord in the way ordered by david king of israel
 and they gave praise to the lord answering one another in their songs and saying for he is good for his mercy to israel is eternal and all the people gave a great cry of joy when they gave praise to the lord because the base of the lords house was put in place
 but a number of the priests and levites and the heads of families old men who had seen the first house when the base of this house was put down before their eyes were overcome with weeping and a number were crying out with joy
 so that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping for the cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off
 now news came to the haters of judah and benjamin that the people who had come back were building a temple to the lord the god of israel
 then they came to zerubbabel and to the heads of families and said to them let us take part in the building with you for we are servants of your god even as you are and we have been making offerings to him from the days of esar haddon king of assyria who put us here
 but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the heads of families in israel said to them you have no part with us in the building of a house for our god we ourselves will do the work together for the lord the god of israel as cyrus king of persia has given us orders
 then the people of the land made the hands of the people of judah feeble troubling them with fear in their building
 and they gave payment to men who made designs against them and kept them from effecting their purpose all through the time of cyrus king of persia till darius became king
 and in the time of ahasuerus when he first became king they put on record a statement against the people of judah and jerusalem
 and in the time of artaxerxes bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of his friends sent a letter to artaxerxes king of persia writing it in the aramaean writing and language
 rehum the chief ruler and shimshai the scribe sent a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king
 the letter was sent by rehum the chief ruler and shimshai the scribe and their friends the dinaites and the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the shushanchites the dehaites the elamites
 and the rest of the nations which the great and noble osnappar took over and put in samaria and the rest of the country over the river
 this is a copy of the letter which they sent to artaxerxes the king your servants living across the river send these words
 we give news to the king that the jews who came from you have come to us at jerusalem they are building up again that uncontrolled and evil town the walls are complete and they are joining up the bases
 the king may be certain that when the building of this town and its walls is complete they will give no tax or payment in goods or forced payments and in the end it will be a cause of loss to the kings
 now because we are responsible to the king and it is not right for us to see the kings honour damaged we have sent to give the king word of these things
 so that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers and you will see in the book of the records that this town has been uncontrolled and a cause of trouble to kings and countries and that there were outbursts against authority there in the past for which reason the town was made waste
 we give you word that if the building of this town and its walls is made complete there will be an end of your power in the country across the river
 then the king sent an answer to rehum the chief ruler and shimshai the scribe and their friends living in samaria and to the rest of those across the river saying peace to you
 and now the sense of the letter which you sent to us has been made clear to me
 and i gave orders for a search to be made and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for kings and that outbursts against authority have taken place there
 further there have been great kings in jerusalem ruling over all the country across the river to whom they gave taxes and payments in goods and forced payments
 give an order now that these men are to do nothing more and that the building of the town is to be stopped till i give an order
 be certain to do this with all care do not let trouble be increased to the kings damage
 then after reading the kings letter rehum and shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to jerusalem to the jews and had them stopped by force
 so the work of the house of god at jerusalem came to an end so it was stopped till the second year of the rule of darius king of persia
 now the prophets haggai and zechariah the son of iddo were preaching to the jews in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel
 then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak got up and made a start at building the house of god at jerusalem and the prophets of god were with them helping them
 at the same time tattenai ruler of the land across the river and shethar bozenai and their men came to them and said who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall
 then they said these words to them what are the names of the men who are at work on this building
 but the eye of their god was on the chiefs of the jews and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before darius and an answer had come by letter about it
 this is a copy of the letter which tattenai the ruler of the land across the river and shethar bozenai and his friends the apharsachites living across the river sent to darius the king
 they sent him a letter saying to darius the king all peace
 this is to give the king word that we went into the land of judah to the house of the great god which is made of great stones and has its walls supported with wood and the work is going on with industry and they are doing it well
 then we said to the men responsible who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls
 and we made request for their names so that we might send you word and give you the names of the men at the head of them
 and they made answer to us saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of israel
 but when the god of heaven was moved to wrath by our fathers he gave them up into the hands of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon the chaldaean who sent destruction on this house and took the people away into babylon
 but in the first year of cyrus king of babylon cyrus the king gave an order for the building of this house of god
 and the gold and silver vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which was in jerusalem and put into the house of his god in babylon these cyrus the king took from the house of his god in babylon and gave to one named sheshbazzar whom he had made ruler
 and he said to him go take these vessels and put them in the temple in jerusalem and let the house of god be put up again in its place
 then this same sheshbazzar came and put the house of god in jerusalem on its bases and from that time till now the building has been going on but it is still not complete
 so now if it seems good to the king let search be made in the kings store house at babylon to see if it is true that an order was given by cyrus the king for the building of this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send us word of his pleasure in connection with this business
 then darius the king gave an order and a search was made in the house of the records where the things of value were stored up in babylon
 and at achmetha in the great house of the king in the land of media they came across a roll in which this statement was put on record
 in the first year of cyrus the king cyrus the king made an order in connection with the house of god at jerusalem let the house be put up the place where they make offerings and let the earth for the bases be put in place let it be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide
 with three lines of great stones and one line of new wood supports and let the necessary money be given out of the kings store house
 and let the gold and silver vessels from the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took from the temple at jerusalem to babylon be given back and taken again to the temple at jerusalem every one in its place and put them in the house of god
 so now tattenai ruler of the land across the river and shethar bozenai and your people the apharsachites across the river keep far from that place
 let the work of this house of god go on let the ruler of the jews and their responsible men put up this house of god in its place
 further i give orders as to what you are to do for the responsible men of the jews in connection with the building of this house of god that from the kings wealth that is from the taxes got together in the land over the river the money needed is to be given to these men readily so that their work may not be stopped
 and whatever they have need of young oxen and sheep and lambs for burned offerings to the god of heaven grain salt wine and oil whatever the priests in jerusalem say is necessary is to be given to them day by day regularly
 so that they may make offerings of a sweet smell to the god of heaven with prayers for the life of the king and of his sons
 and i have given orders that if anyone makes any change in this word one of the supports is to be pulled out of his house and he is to be lifted up and fixed to it and his house is to be made waste for this
 and may the god who has made it a resting place for his name send destruction on all kings and peoples whose hands are outstretched to make any change in this or to do damage to this house of god at jerusalem i darius have given this order let it be done with all care
 then tattenai the ruler across the river and shethar bozenai and their people because of the order given by king darius did as he had said with all care
 and the responsible men of the jews went on with their building and did well helped by the teaching of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo they went on building till it was complete in keeping with the word of the god of israel and the orders given by cyrus and darius and artaxerxes king of persia
 and the building of this house was complete on the third day of the month adar in the sixth year of the rule of darius the king
 and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the rest of those who had come back kept the feast of the opening of this house of god with joy
 and they gave as offerings at the opening of this house of god a hundred oxen two hundred sheep four hundred lambs and for a sin offering for all israel twelve he goats being the number of the tribes of israel
 and they put the priests in their divisions and the levites in their order for the worship of god at jerusalem as it is recorded in the book of moses
 and the children of israel who had come back kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
 for the priests and the levites had made themselves clean together they were all clean and they put the passover lamb to death for all those who had come back and for their brothers the priests and for themselves
 and the children of israel who had come back and all those who were joined to them after separating themselves from the evil ways of the people of the land to become the servants of the lord the god of israel took food together
 and kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with joy for the lord had made them full of joy by turning the heart of the king of assyria to them to give them help in the work of the house of god the god of israel
 now after these things when artaxerxes was king of persia ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah
 the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub
 the son of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth
 the son of zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki
 the son of abishua the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief priest
 this ezra went up from babylon and he was a scribe expert in the law of moses which the lord the god of israel had given and the king moved by the lord his god gave him whatever he made request for
 and some of the children of israel went up with some of the priests and the levites and the music makers and the door keepers and the nethinim to jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king
 and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month in the seventh year of the kings rule
 for starting his journey from babylon on the first day of the first month he came to jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month by the good help of his god
 for ezra had given his mind to learning the law of the lord and doing it and to teaching his rules and decisions in israel
 now this is a copy of the letter which king artaxerxes gave to ezra the priest and the scribe who put into writing the words of the orders of the lord and of his rules for israel
 artaxerxes king of kings to ezra the priest scribe of the law of the god of heaven all peace
 and now it is my order that all those of the people of israel and their priests and levites in my kingdom who are ready and have a desire to go to jerusalem are to go with you
 because you are sent by the king and his seven wise men to get knowledge about judah and jerusalem as you are ordered by the law of your god which is in your hand
 and to take with you the silver and gold freely offered by the king and his wise men to the god of israel whose temple is in jerusalem
 as well as all the silver and gold which you get from the land of babylon together with the offering of the people and of the priests freely given for the house of their god which is in jerusalem
 so with this money get with care oxen sheep and lambs with their meal offerings and their drink offerings to be offered on the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem
 and whatever seems right to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold that do as may be pleasing to your god
 and the vessels which have been given to you for the uses of the house of your god you are to give to the god of jerusalem
 and whatever more is needed for the house of your god and which you may have to give take it from the kings store house
 and i even i artaxerxes the king now give orders to all keepers of the kings money across the river that whatever ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven may have need of from you is to be done with all care
 up to a hundred talents of silver a hundred measures of grain a hundred measures of wine and a hundred measures of oil and salt without measure
 whatever is ordered by the god of heaven let it be done completely for the house of the god of heaven so that there may not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons
 in addition we make it clear to you that it will be against the law to put any tax or payment in goods or forced payment on any of the priests or levites the music makers door keepers nethinim or any servants of this house of god
 and you ezra by the wisdom of your god which is in you are to put rulers and judges to have authority over all the people across the river who have knowledge of the laws of your god and you are to give teaching to him who has no knowledge of them
 and if anyone does not keep the law of your god and the law of the king take care that punishment is given to him by death or by driving him from his country or by taking away his goods or by putting him in prison
 praise be to the lord the god of our fathers who has put such a thing into the heart of the king to make fair the house of the lord which is in jerusalem
 and has given mercy to me before the king and his government and before all the kings great captains and i was made strong by the hand of the lord my god which was on me and i got together out of israel chief men to go up with me
 now these are the heads of families who were listed of those who went up with me from babylon when artaxerxes was king
 of the sons of phinehas gershom of the sons of ithamar daniel of the sons of david hattush
 of the sons of shecaniah of the sons of parosh zechariah and with him were listed a hundred and fifty males
 of the sons of pahath moab eliehoenai the son of zerahiah and with him two hundred males
 of the sons of shecaniah the son of jahaziel and with him three hundred males
 and of the sons of adin ebed the son of jonathan and with him fifty males
 and of the sons of elam jeshaiah the son of athaliah and with him seventy males
 and of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and with him eighty males
 of the sons of joab obadiah the son of jehiel and with him two hundred and eighteen males
 and of the sons of shelomith the son of josiphiah and with him a hundred and sixty males
 and of the sons of bebai zechariah the son of bebai and with him twenty eight males
 and of the sons of azgad johanan the son of hakkatan and with him a hundred and ten males
 and of the sons of adonikam the last whose names were eliphelet jeuel and shemaiah and with them sixty males
 and of the sons of bigvai uthai and zabbud and with them seventy males
 and i made them come together by the river flowing to ahava and we were there in tents for three days and after viewing the people and the priests i saw that no sons of levi were there
 then i sent for eliezer and ariel and shemaiah and elnathan jarib and elnathan and nathan and zechariah and meshullam all responsible men and for joiarib and elnathan who were wise men
 and i sent them to iddo the chief at the place casiphia and gave them orders what to say to iddo and his brothers the nethinim at the place casiphia so that they might come back to us with men to do the work of the house of our god
 and by the help of our god they got for us ish sechel one of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and brothers eighteen
 and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brothers and their sons twenty
 and of the nethinim to whom david and the captains had given the work of helping the levites two hundred and twenty nethinim all of them specially named
 then i gave orders for a time of going without food there by the river ahava so that we might make ourselves low before our god in prayer requesting from him a straight way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance
 for i would not for shame make request to the king for a band of armed men and horsemen to give us help against those who might make attacks on us on the way for we had said to the king the hand of our god is on his servants for good but his power and his wrath are against all those who are turned away from him
 so we went without food requesting our god for this and his ear was open to our prayer
 so i put on one side twelve of the chiefs of the priests sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brothers with them
 and gave to them by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels all the offering for the house of our god which the king and his wise men and his captains and all israel there present had given
 measuring into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels a hundred talents weight and a hundred talents of gold
 and twenty gold basins of a thousand darics and two vessels of the best bright brass equal in value to gold
 and i said to them you are holy to the lord and the vessels are holy and the silver and the gold are an offering freely given to the lord the god of your fathers
 take care of them and keep them till you put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the levites and the chiefs of the families of israel in jerusalem in the rooms of the house of the lord
 so the priests and the levites took the weight of silver and gold and the vessels to take them to jerusalem into the house of our god
 then we went away from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to jerusalem and the hand of our god was on us and he gave us salvation from our haters and those who were waiting to make an attack on us by the way
 and we came to jerusalem and were there for three days
 and on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were measured out by weight in the house of our god into the hands of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them were jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui the levites
 all was handed over by number and by weight and the weight was put on record at that time
 and those who had been prisoners who had come back from a strange land made burned offerings to the god of israel twelve oxen for all israel ninety six male sheep seventy seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a burned offering to the lord
 and they gave the kings orders to the kings captains and the rulers across the river and they gave the people and the house of god the help which was needed
 now after these things were done the captains came to me and said the people of israel and the priests and levites have not kept themselves separate from the people of the lands but have taken part in the disgusting ways of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites
 for they have taken their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed has been mixed with the peoples of the lands and in fact the captains and rulers have been the first to do this evil
 and hearing this with signs of grief and pulling out the hair of my head and my chin i took my seat on the earth deeply troubled
 then everyone who went in fear of the words of the god of israel because of the sin of those who had come back came together to me and i kept where i was overcome with grief till the evening offering
 and at the evening offering having made myself low before god i got up and with signs of grief falling down on my knees with my hands stretched out to the lord my god
 i said o my god shame keeps me from lifting up my face to you my god for our sins are increased higher than our heads and our evil doing has come up to heaven
 from the days of our fathers till this day we have been great sinners and for our sins we and our kings and our priests have been given up into the hands of the kings of the lands to the sword and to prison and to loss of goods and to shame of face as it is this day
 and now for a little time grace has come to us from the lord our god to let a small band of us get free and to give us a nail in his holy place so that our god may give light to our eyes and a measure of new life in our prison chains
 for we are servants but our god has not been turned away from us in our prison but has had mercy on us before the eyes of the kings of persia to give us new strength to put up again the house of our god and to make fair its waste places and to give us a wall in judah and jerusalem
 and now o our god what are we to say after this for we have not kept your laws
 which you gave to your servants the prophets saying the land into which you are going to take it for a heritage is an unclean land because of the evil lives of the peoples of the land and their disgusting ways which have made the land unclean from end to end
 so now do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or do anything for their peace or well being for ever so that you may be strong living on the good of the land and handing it on to your children for a heritage for ever
 and after everything which has come on us because of our evil doing and our great sin and seeing that the punishment which you o god have given us is less than the measure of our sins and that you have kept from death those of us who are here
 are we again to go against your orders taking wives from among the people who do these disgusting things would you not be angry with us till our destruction was complete till there was not one who got away safe
 o lord god of israel righteousness is yours we are only a small band which has been kept from death as at this day see we are before you in our sin for no one may keep his place before you because of this
 at the first god made the heaven and the earth
 and the earth was waste and without form and it was dark on the face of the deep and the spirit of god was moving on the face of the waters
 and god said let there be light and there was light
 and god looking on the light saw that it was good and god made a division between the light and the dark
 naming the light day and the dark night and there was evening and there was morning the first day
 and god said let there be a solid arch stretching over the waters parting the waters from the waters
 and god made the arch for a division between the waters which were under the arch and those which were over it and it was so
 and god gave the arch the name of heaven and there was evening and there was morning the second day
 and god said let the waters under the heaven come together in one place and let the dry land be seen and it was so
 and god gave the dry land the name of earth and the waters together in their place were named seas and god saw that it was good
 and god said let grass come up on the earth and plants producing seed and fruit trees giving fruit in which is their seed after their sort and it was so
 and grass came up on the earth and every plant producing seed of its sort and every tree producing fruit in which is its seed of its sort and god saw that it was good
 and there was evening and there was morning the third day
 and god said let there be lights in the arch of heaven for a division between the day and the night and let them be for signs and for marking the changes of the year and for days and for years
 and let them be for lights in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth and it was so
 and god made the two great lights the greater light to be the ruler of the day and the smaller light to be the ruler of the night and he made the stars
 and god put them in the arch of heaven to give light on the earth
 to have rule over the day and the night and for a division between the light and the dark and god saw that it was good
 and there was evening and there was morning the fourth day
 and god said let the waters be full of living things and let birds be in flight over the earth under the arch of heaven
 and god made great sea beasts and every sort of living and moving thing with which the waters were full and every sort of winged bird and god saw that it was good
 and god gave them his blessing saying be fertile and have increase making all the waters of the seas full and let the birds be increased in the earth
 and there was evening and there was morning the fifth day
 and god said let the earth give birth to all sorts of living things cattle and all things moving on the earth and beasts of the earth after their sort and it was so
 and god made the beast of the earth after its sort and the cattle after their sort and everything moving on the face of the earth after its sort and god saw that it was good
 and god said let us make man in our image like us and let him have rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every living thing which goes flat on the earth
 and god made man in his image in the image of god he made him male and female he made them
 and god gave them his blessing and said to them be fertile and have increase and make the earth full and be masters of it be rulers over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing moving on the earth
 and god said see i have given you every plant producing seed on the face of all the earth and every tree which has fruit producing seed they will be for your food
 and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and every living thing moving on the face of the earth i have given every green plant for food and it was so
 and god saw everything which he had made and it was very good and there was evening and there was morning the sixth day
 now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth these are the sons which they had after the great flow of waters
 the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras
 and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah
 and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish the kittim and the dodanim
 from these came the nations of the sea lands with their different families and languages
 and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and put and canaan
 and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabteca and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan
 and cush was the father of nimrod who was the first of the great men of the earth
 he was a very great bowman so that there is a saying like nimrod a very great bowman
 and at the first his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar
 from that land he went out into assyria building nineveh with its wide streets and calah
 and resen between nineveh and calah which is a very great town
 and mizraim was the father of the ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim
 and pathrusim and casluhim and caphtorim from whom came the philistines
 and canaan was the father of zidon who was his oldest son and heth
 and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgashite
 and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite
 and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite after that the families of the canaanites went far and wide in all directions
 their country stretching from zidon to gaza in the direction of gerar and to lasha in the direction of sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboiim
 all these with their different families languages lands and nations are the offspring of ham
 and shem the older brother of japheth the father of the children of eber had other sons in addition
 these are the sons of shem elam and asshur and arpachshad and lud and aram
 and the sons of aram uz and hul and gether and mash
 and arpachshad became the father of shelah and shelah became the father of eber
 and eber had two sons the name of the one was peleg because in his time the peoples of the earth became separate and his brothers name was joktan
 and joktan was the father of almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah
 and hadoram and uzal and diklah
 and obal and abimael and sheba
 and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan
 and their country was from mesha in the direction of sephar the mountain of the east
 these with their families and their languages and their lands and their nations are the offspring of shem
 these are the families of the sons of noah in the order of their generations and their nations from these came all the nations of the earth after the great flow of waters
 and all the earth had one language and one tongue
 and it came about that in their wandering from the east they came to a stretch of flat country in the land of shinar and there they made their living place
 and they said one to another come let us make bricks burning them well and they had bricks for stone putting them together with sticky earth
 and they said come let us make a town and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven and let us make a great name for ourselves so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth
 and the lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building
 and the lord said see they are all one people and have all one language and this is only the start of what they may do and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs
 come let us go down and take away the sense of their language so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another
 so the lord god sent them away into every part of the earth and they gave up building their town
 so it was named babel because there the lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the lord sent them away over all the face of the earth
 these are the generations of shem shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of arpachshad two years after the great flow of waters
 and after the birth of arpachshad shem went on living for five hundred years and had sons and daughters
 and arpachshad was thirty five years old when he became the father of shelah
 and after the birth of shelah arpachshad went on living for four hundred and three years and had sons and daughters
 and shelah was thirty years old when he became the father of eber
 and after the birth of eber shelah went on living for four hundred and three years and had sons and daughters
 and eber was thirty four years old when he became the father of peleg
 and after the birth of peleg eber went on living for four hundred and thirty years and had sons and daughters
 and peleg was thirty years old when he became the father of reu
 and after the birth of reu peleg went on living for two hundred and nine years and had sons and daughters
 and reu was thirty two years old when he became the father of serug
 and after the birth of serug reu went on living for two hundred and seven years and had sons and daughters
 and serug was thirty years old when he became the father of nahor
 and after the birth of nahor serug went on living for two hundred years and had sons and daughters
 and nahor was twenty nine years old when he became the father of terah
 and after the birth of terah nahor went on living for a hundred and nineteen years and had sons and daughters
 and terah was seventy years old when he became the father of abram nahor and haran
 these are the generations of terah terah was the father of abram nahor and haran and haran was the father of lot
 and death came to haran when he was with his father terah in the land of his birth ur of the chaldees
 and abram and nahor took wives for themselves the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife was milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and iscah
 and sarai had no child
 and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran and sarai his daughter in law the wife of his son abram and they went out from ur of the chaldees to go to the land of canaan and they came to haran and were there for some time
 and all the years of terahs life were two hundred and five and terah came to his end in haran
 now the lord said to abram go out from your country and from your family and from your fathers house into the land to which i will be your guide
 and i will make of you a great nation blessing you and making your name great and you will be a blessing
 to them who are good to you will i give blessing and on him who does you wrong will i put my curse and you will become a name of blessing to all the families of the earth
 so abram went as the lord had said to him and lot went with him abram was seventy five years old when he went away from haran
 and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their goods and the servants which they had got in haran and they went out to go to the land of canaan
 and abram went through the land till he came to shechem to the holy tree of moreh at that time the canaanites were still living in the land
 and the lord came to abram and said i will give all this land to your seed then abram made an altar there to the lord who had let himself be seen by him
 and moving on from there to the mountain on the east of beth el he put up his tent having beth el on the west and ai on the east and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the lord
 and he went on journeying still to the south
 and because there was little food to be had in that land he went down into egypt
 now when he came near to egypt he said to sarai his wife truly you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye
 and i am certain that when the men of egypt see you they will say this is his wife and they will put me to death and keep you
 say then that you are my sister and so it will be well with me because of you and my life will be kept safe on your account
 and so it was that when abram came into egypt the men of egypt looking on the woman saw that she was fair
 and pharaohs great men having seen her said words in praise of her to pharaoh and she was taken into pharaohs house
 and because of her he was good to abram and he had sheep and oxen and asses and men servants and women servants and camels
 and the lord sent great troubles on pharaohs house because of sarai abrams wife
 then pharaoh sent for abram and said what have you done to me why did you not say that she was your wife
 why did you say that she was your sister so that i took her for my wife now take your wife and go on your way
 and pharaoh gave orders to his men and they sent him on his way with his wife and all he had
 and abram went up out of egypt with his wife and all he had and lot with him and they came in to the south
 now abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold
 and travelling on from the south he came to beth el to the place where his tent had been before between beth el and ai
 to the place where he had made his first altar and there abram gave worship to the name of the lord
 and lot who went with him had flocks and herds and tents
 so that the land was not wide enough for the two of them their property was so great that there was not room for them together
 and there was an argument between the keepers of abrams cattle and the keepers of lots cattle at that time the canaanites and perizzites were still living in the land
 then abram said to lot let there be no argument between me and you and between my herdmen and your herdmen for we are brothers
 is not all the land before you then let us go our separate ways if you go to the left i will go to the right or if you take the right i will go to the left
 and lot lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of jordan saw that it was well watered everywhere before the lord had sent destruction on sodom and gomorrah it was like the garden of the lord like the land of egypt on the way to zoar
 so lot took for himself all the valley of jordan and went to the east and they were parted from one another
 abram went on living in the land of canaan and lot went to the lowland towns moving his tent as far as sodom
 now the men of sodom were evil and great sinners before the lord
 and the lord had said to abram after lot was parted from him from this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south to the east and to the west
 for all the land which you see i will give to you and to your seed for ever
 and i will make your children like the dust of the earth so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered then will your children be numbered
 come go through all the land from one end to the other for i will give it to you
 and abram moving his tent came and made his living place by the holy tree of mamre which is in hebron and made an altar there to the lord
 now in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim
 they made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela  which is zoar 
 all these came together in the valley of siddim  which is the salt sea 
 for twelve years they were under the rule of chedorlaomer but in the thirteenth year they put off his control
 and in the fourteenth year chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side overcame the rephaim in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzim in ham and the emim in shaveh kiriathaim
 and the horites in their mountain seir driving them as far as el paran which is near the waste land
 then they came back to en mishpat  which is kadesh  making waste all the country of the amalekites and of the amorites living in hazazon tamar
 and the king of sodom with the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela  that is zoar  went out and put their forces in position in the valley of siddim
 against chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings against the five
 now the valley of siddim was full of holes of sticky earth and the kings of sodom and gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there but the rest got away to the mountain
 and the four kings took all the goods and food from sodom and gomorrah and went on their way
 and in addition they took lot abrams brothers son who was living in sodom and all his goods
 and one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to abram the hebrew who was living by the holy tree of mamre the amorite the brother of eshcol and aner who were friends of abram
 and abram hearing that his brothers son had been made a prisoner took a band of his trained men three hundred and eighteen of them sons of his house and went after them as far as dan
 and separating his forces by night he overcame them putting them to flight and going after them as far as hobah which is on the north side of damascus
 and he got back all the goods and lot his brothers son with his goods and the women and the people
 and when he was coming back after putting to flight chedorlaomer and the other kings he had a meeting with the king of sodom in the valley of shaveh that is the kings valley
 and melchizedek king of salem the priest of the most high god took bread and wine
 and blessing him said may the blessing of the most high god maker of heaven and earth be on abram
 and let the most high god be praised who has given into your hands those who were against you then abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken
 and the king of sodom said to abram give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself
 but abram said to the king of sodom i have taken an oath to the lord the most high god maker of heaven and earth
 that i will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours so that you may not say i have given wealth to abram
 give me nothing but the food which the fighting men who went with me have had but let aner and eshcol and mamre have their part of the goods
 after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision saying have no fear abram i will keep you safe and great will be your reward
 and abram said what will you give me for i have no child and this eliezer of damascus will have all my wealth after me
 and abram said you have given me no child and a servant in my house will get the heritage
 then said the lord this man will not get the heritage but a son of your body will have your property after you
 and he took him out into the open air and said to him let your eyes be lifted to heaven and see if the stars may be numbered even so will your seed be
 and he had faith in the lord and it was put to his account as righteousness
 and he said to him i am the lord who took you from ur of the chaldees to give you this land for your heritage
 and he said o lord god how may i be certain that it will be mine
 and he said take a young cow of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a sheep of three years old and a dove and a young pigeon
 all these he took cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other but not cutting the birds in two
 and evil birds came down on the bodies but abram sent them away
 now when the sun was going down a deep sleep came on abram and a dark cloud of fear
 and he said to abram truly your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years
 but i will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are and they will come out from among them with great wealth
 as for you you will go to your fathers in peace at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting place
 and in the fourth generation they will come back here for at present the sin of the amorite is not full
 then when the sun went down and it was dark he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies
 in that day the lord made an agreement with abram and said to your seed have i given this land from the river of egypt to the great river the river euphrates
 the kenite the kenizzite and the kadmonite
 and the hittite and the perizzite and the rephaim
 and the amorite and the canaanite and the girgashite and the jebusite
 now sarai abrams wife had given him no children and she had a servant a woman of egypt whose name was hagar
 and sarai said to abram see the lord has not let me have children go in to my servant for i may get a family through her and abram did as sarai said
 so after abram had been living for ten years in the land of canaan sarai took hagar her egyptian servant and gave her to abram for his wife
 and he went in to hagar and she became with child and when she saw that she was with child she no longer had any respect for her masters wife
 and sarai said to abram may my wrong be on you i gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child she no longer had any respect for me may the lord be judge between you and me
 and abram said the woman is in your power do with her whatever seems good to you and sarai was cruel to her so that she went running away from her
 and an angel of the lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land by the fountain on the way to shur
 and he said hagar sarais servant where have you come from and where are you going and she said i am running away from sarai my masters wife
 and the angel said to her go back and put yourself under her authority
 and the angel of the lord said your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered
 and the angel of the lord said see you are with child and will give birth to a son to whom you will give the name ishmael because the ears of the lord were open to your sorrow
 and he will be like a mountain ass among men his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he will keep his place against all his brothers
 and to the lord who was talking with her she gave this name you are a god who is seen for she said have i not even here in the waste land had a vision of god and am still living
 so that fountain was named fountain of life and vision it is between kadesh and bered
 and hagar gave birth to a child the son of abram to whom abram gave the name of ishmael
 abram was eighty six years old when hagar gave birth to ishmael
 when abram was ninety nine years old the lord came to him and said i am god ruler of all go in my ways and be upright in all things
 and i will make an agreement between you and me and your offspring will be greatly increased
 and abram went down on his face on the earth and the lord god went on talking with him and said
 as for me my agreement is made with you and you will be the father of nations without end
 no longer will your name be abram but abraham for i have made you the father of a number of nations
 i will make you very fertile so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring
 and i will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations an eternal agreement to be a god to you and to your seed after you
 and to you and to your seed after you i will give the land in which you are living all the land of canaan for an eternal heritage and i will be their god
 and god said to abraham on your side you are to keep the agreement you and your seed after you through all generations
 and this is the agreement which you are to keep with me you and your seed after you every male among you is to undergo circumcision
 in the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it as a mark of the agreement between me and you
 every male among you from one generation to another is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old with every servant whose birth takes place in your house or for whom you gave money to someone of another country and not of your seed
 he who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price all are to undergo circumcision so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh an agreement for all time
 and any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people my agreement has been broken by him
 and god said as for sarai your wife from now her name will be not sarai but sarah
 and i will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her truly my blessing will be on her and she will be the mother of nations kings of peoples will be her offspring
 then abraham went down on his face and laughing said in his heart may a man a hundred years old have a child will sarah at ninety years old give birth
 and abraham said to god if only ishmaels life might be your care 
 and god said not so but sarah your wife will have a son and you will give him the name isaac and i will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him
 as for ishmael i have given ear to your prayer truly i have given him my blessing and i will make him fertile and give him great increase he will be the father of twelve chiefs and i will make him a great nation
 but my agreement will be with isaac to whom sarah will give birth a year from this time
 and having said these words god went up from abraham
 and abraham took ishmael his son and all whose birth had taken place in his house and all his servants whom he had made his for a price every male of his house and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as god had said to him
 abraham was ninety nine years old when he underwent circumcision
 and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision
 abraham and ishmael his son underwent circumcision on that very day
 and all the men of his house those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands underwent circumcision with him
 now the lord came to him by the holy tree of mamre when he was seated in the doorway of his tent in the middle of the day
 and lifting up his eyes he saw three men before him and seeing them he went quickly to them from the door of the tent and went down on his face to the earth
 and said my lord if now i have grace in your eyes do not go away from your servant
 let me get water for washing your feet and take your rest under the tree
 and let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength and after that you may go on your way for this is why you have come to your servant and they said let it be so
 then abraham went quickly into the tent and said to sarah get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes
 and running to the herd he took a young ox soft and fat and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready
 and he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them waiting by them under the tree while they took food
 and they said to him where is sarah your wife and he said she is in the tent
 and he said i will certainly come back to you in the spring and sarah your wife will have a son and his words came to the ears of sarah who was at the back of the tent door
 now abraham and sarah were very old and sarah was past the time for giving birth
 and sarah laughing to herself said now that i am used up am i still to have pleasure my husband himself being old
 and the lord said why was sarah laughing and saying is it possible for me being old to give birth to a child
 is there any wonder which the lord is not able to do at the time i said in the spring i will come back to you and sarah will have a child
 then sarah said i was not laughing for she was full of fear and he said no but you were laughing
 and the men went on from there in the direction of sodom and abraham went with them on their way
 and the lord said am i to keep back from abraham the knowledge of what i do
 seeing that abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing
 for i have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him to keep the ways of the lord to do what is good and right so that the lord may do to abraham as he has said
 and the lord said because the outcry against sodom and gomorrah is very great and their sin is very evil
 i will go down now and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me and if they are not i will see
 and the men turning from that place went on to sodom but abraham was still waiting before the lord
 and abraham came near and said will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners
 if by chance there are fifty upright men in the town will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men
 let such a thing be far from you to put the upright to death with the sinner will not the judge of all the earth do right
 and the lord said if there are fifty upright men in the town i will have mercy on it because of them
 and abraham answering said truly i who am only dust have undertaken to put my thoughts before the lord
 if by chance there are five less than fifty upright men will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five and he said i will not give it to destruction if there are forty five
 and again he said to him by chance there may be forty there and he said i will not do it if there are forty
 and he said let not the lord be angry with me if i say what if there are thirty there and he said i will not do it if there are thirty
 and he said see now i have undertaken to put my thoughts before the lord what if there are twenty there and he said i will have mercy because of the twenty
 and he said o let not the lord be angry and i will say only one word more by chance there may be ten there and he said i will have mercy because of the ten
 and the lord went on his way when his talk with abraham was ended and abraham went back to his place
 and at nightfall the two angels came to sodom and lot was seated at the way into the town and when he saw them he got up and came before them falling down on his face to the earth
 and he said my masters come now into your servants house and take your rest there for the night and let your feet be washed and early in the morning you may go on your way and they said not so but we will take our nights rest in the street
 but he made his request more strongly so they went with him into his house and he got food ready for them and made unleavened bread of which they took
 but before they had gone to bed the men of the town all the men of sodom came round the house young and old from every part of the town
 and crying out to lot they said where are the men who came to your house this night send them out to us so that we may take our pleasure with them
 and lot went out to them in the doorway shutting the door after him
 and he said my brothers do not this evil
 see now i have two unmarried daughters i will send them out to you so that you may do to them whatever seems good to you only do nothing to these men for this is why they have come under the shade of my roof
 and they said give way there this one man they said came here from a strange country and will he now be our judge now we will do worse to you than to them and pushing violently against lot they came near to get the door broken in
 but the men put out their hands and took lot into the house to them shutting the door again
 but the men who were outside the door they made blind all of them small and great so that they were tired out with looking for the door
 then the men said to lot are there any others of your family here sons in law or sons or daughters take them all out of this place
 for we are about to send destruction on this place because a great outcry against them has come to the ears of the lord and the lord has sent us to put an end to the town
 and lot went out and said to his sons in law who were married to his daughters come let us go out of this place for the lord is about to send destruction on the town but his sons in law did not take him seriously
 and when morning came the angels did all in their power to make lot go saying get up quickly and take your wife and your two daughters who are here and go for fear that you come to destruction in the punishment of the town
 but while he was waiting the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand for the lord had mercy on them and put them outside the town
 and when they had put them out he said go for your life without looking back or waiting in the lowland go quickly to the mountain or you will come to destruction
 and lot said to them not so o my lord
 see now your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction but i am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death
 this town now is near and it is a little one o let me go there  is it not a little one  so that my life may be safe
 and he said see i have given you your request in this one thing more i will not send destruction on this town
 go there quickly for i am not able to do anything till you have come there for this reason the town was named zoar
 the sun was up when lot came to zoar
 then the lord sent fire and flaming smoke raining down from heaven on sodom and gomorrah
 and he sent destruction on those towns with all the lowland and all the people of those towns and every green thing in the land
 but lots wife looking back became a pillar of salt
 and abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had been talking with the lord
 and looking in the direction of sodom and gomorrah and the lowland he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of an oven
 so it came about that when god sent destruction on the towns of the lowland he kept his word to abraham and sent lot safely away when he put an end to the towns where he was living
 then lot went up out of zoar to the mountain and was living there with his two daughters for fear kept him from living in zoar and he and his daughters made their living place in a hole in the rock
 and the older daughter said to her sister our father is old and there is no man to be a husband to us in the natural way
 come let us give our father much wine and we will go into his bed so that we may have offspring by our father
 and that night they made their father take much wine and the older daughter went into his bed and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away
 and on the day after the older daughter said to the younger last night i was with my father let us make him take much wine this night again and do you go to him so that we may have offspring by our father
 and that night again they made their father take much wine and the younger daughter went into his bed and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away
 and so the two daughters of lot were with child by their father
 and the older daughter had a son and she gave him the name moab he is the father of the moabites to this day
 and the younger had a son and gave him the name ben ammi from him come the children of ammon to this day
 and the heaven and the earth and all things in them were complete
 and on the seventh day god came to the end of all his work and on the seventh day he took his rest from all the work which he had done
 and god gave his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy because on that day he took his rest from all the work which he had made and done
 these are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were made
 in the day when the lord god made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth and no grass had come up for the lord god had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land
 but a mist went up from the earth watering all the face of the land
 and the lord god made man from the dust of the earth breathing into him the breath of life and man became a living soul
 and the lord god made a garden in the east in eden and there he put the man whom he had made
 and out of the earth the lord made every tree to come delighting the eye and good for food and in the middle of the garden the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
 and a river went out of eden giving water to the garden and from there it was parted and became four streams
 the name of the first is pishon which goes round about all the land of havilah where there is gold
 and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
 and the name of the second river is gihon this river goes round all the land of cush
 and the name of the third river is tigris which goes to the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates
 and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to do work in it and take care of it
 and the lord god gave the man orders saying you may freely take of the fruit of every tree of the garden
 but of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take for on the day when you take of it death will certainly come to you
 and the lord god said it is not good for the man to be by himself i will make one like himself as a help to him
 and from the earth the lord god made every beast of the field and every bird of the air and took them to the man to see what names he would give them and whatever name he gave to any living thing that was its name
 and the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field but adam had no one like himself as a help
 and the lord god sent a deep sleep on the man and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping joining up the flesh again in its place
 and the bone which the lord god had taken from the man he made into a woman and took her to the man
 and the man said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh let her name be woman because she was taken out of man
 for this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and they will be one flesh
 and the man and his wife were without clothing and they had no sense of shame
 and abraham went on his way from there to the land of the south and was living between kadesh and shur in gerar
 and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
 but god came to abimelech in a dream in the night and said to him truly you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken for she is a mans wife
 now abimelech had not come near her and he said lord will you put to death an upright nation
 did he not say to me himself she is my sister and she herself said he is my brother with an upright heart and clean hands have i done this
 and god said to him in the dream i see that you have done this with an upright heart and i have kept you from sinning against me for this reason i did not let you come near her
 so now give the man back his wife for he is a prophet and let him say a prayer for you so your life may be safe but if you do not give her back be certain that death will come to you and all your house
 so abimelech got up early in the morning and sent for all his servants and gave them word of these things and they were full of fear
 then abimelech sent for abraham and said what have you done to us what wrong have i done you that you have put on me and on my kingdom so great a sin you have done to me things which are not to be done
 and abimelech said to abraham why did you do this thing
 and abraham said because it seemed to me that there was no fear of god in this place and that they might put me to death because of my wife
 and in fact she is my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
 and when god sent me wandering from my fathers house i said to her let this be the sign of your love for me wherever we go say of me he is my brother
 then abimelech gave to abraham sheep and oxen and men servants and women servants and gave him back his wife sarah
 and abimelech said see all my land is before you take whatever place seems good to you
 and he said to sarah see i have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right now your honour is clear in the eyes of all
 then abraham made prayer to god and god made abimelech well again and his wife and his women servants so that they had children
 for the lord had kept all the women of the house of abimelech from having children because of sarah abrahams wife
 and the lord came to sarah as he had said and did to her as he had undertaken
 and sarah became with child and gave abraham a son when he was old at the time named by god
 and abraham gave to his son to whom sarah had given birth the name isaac
 and when his son isaac was eight days old abraham made him undergo circumcision as god had said to him
 now abraham was a hundred years old when the birth of isaac took place
 and sarah said god has given me cause for laughing and everyone who has news of it will be laughing with me
 and she said who would have said to abraham that sarah would have a child at her breast for see i have given him a son now when he is old
 and when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast abraham made a great feast
 and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian playing with isaac
 so she said to abraham send away that woman and her son for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son isaac
 and this was a great grief to abraham because of his son
 but god said let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and hagar his mother give ear to whatever sarah says to you because it is from isaac that your seed will take its name
 and i will make a nation of the son of your servant woman because he is your seed
 and early in the morning abraham got up and gave hagar some bread and a water skin and put the boy on her back and sent her away and she went wandering in the waste land of beer sheba
 and when all the water in the skin was used up she put the child down under a tree
 and she went some distance away about an arrow flight and seating herself on the earth she gave way to bitter weeping saying let me not see the death of my child
 and the boys cry came to the ears of god and the angel of god said to hagar from heaven hagar why are you weeping have no fear for the childs cry has come to the ears of god
 come take your child in your arms for i will make of him a great nation
 then god made her eyes open and she saw a water spring and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink
 and god was with the boy and he became tall and strong and he became a bowman living in the waste land
 and while he was in the waste land of paran his mother got him a wife from the land of egypt
 now at that time abimelech and phicol the captain of his army said to abraham i see that god is with you in all you do
 now then give me your oath in the name of god that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me but that as i have been good to you so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living
 and abraham said i will give you my oath
 but abraham made a protest to abimelech because of a water hole which abimelechs servants had taken by force
 but abimelech said i have no idea who has done this thing you never gave me word of it and i had no knowledge of it till this day
 and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to abimelech and the two of them made an agreement together
 and abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves
 then abimelech said what are these seven lambs which you have put on one side
 and he said take these seven lambs from me as a witness that i have made this water hole
 so he gave that place the name beer sheba because there the two of them had given their oaths
 so they made an agreement at beer sheba and abimelech and phicol the captain of his army went back to the land of the philistines
 and abraham after planting a holy tree in beer sheba gave worship to the name of the lord the eternal god
 and abraham went on living in the land of the philistines as in a strange country
 now after these things god put abraham to the test and said to him abraham and he said here am i
 and he said to him take your son your dearly loved only son isaac and go to the land of moriah and give him as a burned offering on one of the mountains of which i will give you knowledge
 and abraham got up early in the morning and made ready his ass and took with him two of his young men and isaac his son and after the wood for the burned offering had been cut he went on his way to the place of which god had given him word
 and on the third day abraham lifting up his eyes saw the place a long way off
 then he said to his young men keep here with the ass and i and the boy will go on and give worship and come back again to you
 and abraham put the wood for the burned offering on his sons back and he himself took the fire and the knife in his hand and the two of them went on together
 then isaac said to abraham my father and he said here am i my son and he said we have wood and fire here but where is the lamb for the burned offering
 and abraham said god himself will give the lamb for the burned offering so they went on together
 and they came to the place of which god had given him knowledge and there abraham made the altar and put the wood in place on it and having made tight the bands round isaac his son he put him on the wood on the altar
 and stretching out his hand abraham took the knife to put his son to death
 but the voice of the angel of the lord came from heaven saying abraham abraham and he said here am i
 and he said let not your hand be stretched out against the boy to do anything to him for now i am certain that the fear of god is in your heart because you have not kept back your son your only son from me
 and lifting up his eyes abraham saw a sheep fixed by its horns in the brushwood and abraham took the sheep and made a burned offering of it in place of his son
 and abraham gave that place the name yahweh yireh as it is said to this day in the mountain the lord is seen
 and the voice of the angel of the lord came to abraham a second time from heaven
 saying i have taken an oath by my name says the lord because you have done this and have not kept back from me your dearly loved only son
 that i will certainly give you my blessing and your seed will be increased like the stars of heaven and the sand by the seaside your seed will take the land of those who are against them
 and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth because you have done what i gave you orders to do
 then abraham went back to his young men and they went together to beer sheba the place where abraham was living
 after these things abraham had news that milcah the wife of his brother nahor had given birth to children
 uz the oldest and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram
 and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel
 bethuel was the father of rebekah these eight were the children of milcah and nahor abrahams brother
 and his servant reumah gave birth to tebah and gaham and tahash and maacah
 now the years of sarahs life were a hundred and twenty seven
 and sarahs death took place in kiriath arba that is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham went into his house weeping and sorrowing for sarah
 and abraham came from his dead and said to the children of heth
 i am living among you as one from a strange country give me some land here as my property so that i may put my dead to rest
 and in answer the children of heth said to abraham
 my lord truly you are a great chief among us take the best of our resting places for your dead not one of us will keep back from you a place where you may put your dead to rest
 and abraham got up and gave honour to the children of heth the people of that land
 and he said to them if you will let me put my dead to rest here make a request for me to ephron the son of zohar
 that he will give me the hollow in the rock named machpelah which is his property at the end of his field let him give it to me for its full price as a resting place for my dead among you
 now ephron was seated among the children of heth and ephron the hittite gave abraham his answer in the hearing of the children of heth and of all those who came into his town saying
 no my lord i will give you the field with the hollow in the rock before all the children of my people will i give it to you for a resting place for your dead
 and abraham went down on his face before the people of the land
 and abraham said to ephron in the hearing of the people of the land if only you will give ear to me i will give you the price of the field take it and let me put my dead to rest there
 so ephron said to abraham
 my lord give ear to me the value of the land is four hundred shekels what is that between me and you so put your dead to rest there
 and abraham took note of the price fixed by ephron in the hearing of the children of heth and gave him four hundred shekels in current money
 so ephrons field at machpelah near mamre with the hollow in the rock and all the trees in the field and round it
 became the property of abraham before the eyes of the children of heth and of all who came into the town
 then abraham put sarah his wife to rest in the hollow rock in the field of machpelah near mamre that is hebron in the land of canaan
 and the field and the hollow rock were handed over to abraham as his property by the children of heth
 now abraham was old and far on in years and the lord had given him everything in full measure
 and abraham said to his chief servant the manager of all his property come now put your hand under my leg
 and take an oath by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that you will not get a wife for my son isaac from the daughters of the canaanites among whom i am living
 but that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son isaac
 and the servant said if by chance the woman will not come with me into this land am i to take your son back again to the land from which you came
 and abraham said take care that you do not let my son go back to that land
 the lord god of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my birth and made an oath to me saying to your seed i will give this land he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land
 and if the woman will not come with you then you are free from this oath only do not take my son back there
 and the servant put his hand under abrahams leg and gave him his oath about this thing
 and the servant took ten of his masters camels and all sorts of good things of his masters and went to mesopotamia to the town of nahor
 and he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water spring in the evening at the time when the women came to get water
 and he said o lord the god of my master abraham let me do well in what i have undertaken this day and give your mercy to my master abraham
 see i am waiting here by the water spring and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water
 now may the girl to whom i say let down your vessel and give me a drink and who says in answer here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels may she be the one marked out by you for your servant isaac so may i be certain that you have been good to my master abraham
 and even before his words were ended rebekah the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah who was the wife of nahor abrahams brother came out with her water vessel on her arm
 she was a very beautiful girl a virgin who had never been touched by a man and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel
 and the servant came running to her and said give me a little water from your vessel
 and she said take a drink my lord and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand she gave him a drink
 and having done so she said i will get water for your camels till they have had enough
 and after putting the water from her vessel into the animals drinking place she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels
 and the man looking at her said nothing waiting to see if the lord had given his journey a good outcome
 and when the camels had had enough the man took a gold nose ring half a shekel in weight and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold
 and said to her whose daughter are you is there room in your fathers house for us
 and she said to him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah nahors wife
 and she said we have a great store of dry grass and cattle food and there is room for you
 and with bent head the man gave worship to the lord
 and said praise be to the lord the god of my master abraham who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master by guiding me straight to the house of my masters family
 so the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mothers house
 now rebekah had a brother named laban and he came out quickly to the man at the water spring
 and when he saw the nose ring and the ornaments on his sisters hands and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water spring
 and he said to him come in you on whom is the blessing of the lord why are you waiting outside for i have made the house ready for you and a place for the camels
 then the man came into the house and laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet
 and meat was put before him but he said i will not take food till i have made my business clear to you and they said do so
 and he said i am abrahams servant
 the lord has given my master every blessing and he has become great he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and men servants and women servants and camels and asses
 and when sarah my masters wife was old she gave birth to a son to whom he has given all he has
 and my master made me take an oath saying do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the canaanites among whom i am living
 but go to my fathers house and to my relations for a wife for my son
 and i said to my master what if the woman will not come with me
 and he said the lord whom i have ever kept before me will send his angel with you who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my fathers house
 and you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people and if they will not give her to you you will be free from your oath
 and i came today to the water spring and i said o lord the god of my master abraham if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey
 let it come about that while i am waiting here by the water spring if a girl comes to get water and i say to her give me a little water from your vessel and she says
 take a drink and i will get water for your camels let her be the woman marked out by the lord for my masters son
 and even while i was saying this to myself rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm and she went down to the spring to get water and i said to her give me a drink
 and straight away she took down her vessel from her arm and said take a drink and i will get water for your camels
 and questioning her i said whose daughter are you and she said the daughter of bethuel the son of nahor and milcah his wife then i put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands
 and with bent head i gave worship and praise to the lord the god of my master abraham by whom i had been guided in the right way to get the daughter of my masters brother for his son
 and now say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not in order that it may be clear to me what i have to do
 then laban and bethuel said in answer this is the lords doing it is not for us to say yes or no to you
 see here is rebekah take her and go and let her be your masters sons wife as the lord has said
 and at these words abrahams servant went down on his face and gave praise to the lord
 then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to rebekah and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother
 then he and the men who were with him had food and drink and took their rest there that night and in the morning he got up and said let me now go back to my master
 but her brother and her mother said let the girl be with us a week or ten days and then she may go
 and he said do not keep me the lord has given a good outcome to my journey let me now go back to my master
 and they said we will send for the girl and let her make the decision
 and they sent for rebekah and said to her are you ready to go with this man and she said i am ready
 so they sent their sister rebekah and her servant with abrahams servant and his men
 and they gave rebekah their blessing saying o sister may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them
 so rebekah and her servant women went with the man seated on the camels and so the servant took rebekah and went on his way
 now isaac had come through the waste land to beer lahai roi for he was living in the south
 and when the evening was near he went wandering out into the fields and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming
 and when rebekah looking up saw isaac she got down from her camel
 and said to the servant who is that man coming to us through the field and the servant said it is my master then she took her veil covering her face with it
 then the servant gave isaac the story of all he had done
 and isaac took rebekah into his tent and she became his wife and in his love for her isaac was comforted after his fathers death
 and abraham took another wife named keturah
 she became the mother of zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah
 and jokshan became the father of sheba and dedan and from dedan came the asshurim and letushim and leummim
 and from midian came ephah and epher and hanoch and abida and eldaah all these were the offspring of keturah
 now abraham gave all his property to isaac
 but to the sons of his other women he gave offerings and sent them away while he was still living into the east country
 now the years of abrahams life were a hundred and seventy five
 and abraham came to his death an old man full of years and he was put to rest with his people
 and isaac and ishmael his sons put him to rest in the hollow rock of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite near mamre
 the same field which abraham got from the children of heth there abraham was put to rest with sarah his wife
 now after the death of abraham the blessing of god was with isaac his son
 now these are the generations of ishmael the son of abraham whose mother was hagar the egyptian the servant of sarah
 these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their generations ishmaels first son was nebaioth then kedar and adbeel and mibsam
 and mishma and dumah and massa
 hadad and tema jetur naphish and kedemah
 these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names in their towns and their tent circles twelve chiefs with their peoples
 and the years of ishmaels life were a hundred and thirty seven and he came to his end and was put to rest with his people
 and their country was from havilah to shur which is east of egypt they took their place to the east of all their brothers
 now these are the generations of abrahams son isaac
 isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the aramaean of paddan aram and the sister of laban the aramaean to be his wife
 isaac made prayer to the lord for his wife because she had no children and the lord gave ear to his prayer and rebekah became with child
 and the children were fighting together inside her and she said if it is to be so why am i like this so she went to put her question to the lord
 and the lord said to her two nations are in your body and two peoples will come to birth from you the one will be stronger than the other and the older will be the servant of the younger
 and when the time came for her to give birth there were two children in her body
 and the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair and they gave him the name of esau
 and after him his brother came out gripping esaus foot and he was named jacob isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them
 and the boys came to full growth and esau became a man of the open country an expert bowman but jacob was a quiet man living in tents
 now isaacs love was for esau because esaus meat was greatly to his taste but rebekah had more love for jacob
 and one day jacob was cooking some soup when esau came in from the fields in great need of food
 and esau said to jacob give me a full meal of that red soup for i am overcome with need for food for this reason he was named edom
 and jacob said first of all give me your birthright
 and esau said truly i am at the point of death what profit is the birthright to me
 and jacob said first of all give me your oath and he gave him his oath handing over his birthright to jacob
 then jacob gave him bread and soup and he took food and drink and went away caring little for his birthright
 then came a time of great need in the land like that which had been before in the days of abraham and isaac went to abimelech king of the philistines at gerar
 and the lord came to him in a vision and said do not go down to egypt keep in the land of which i will give you knowledge
 keep in this land and i will be with you and give you my blessing for to you and to your seed will i give all these lands giving effect to the oath which i made to your father abraham
 i will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number and will give them all these lands and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth
 because abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words my rules my orders and my laws
 so isaac went on living in gerar
 and when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife he said she is my sister fearing to say she is my wife for he said the men of the place may put me to death on account of rebekah because she is very beautiful
 and when he had been there for some time abimelech king of the philistines looking through a window saw isaac playing with rebekah his wife
 and he said to isaac it is clear that she is your wife why then did you say she is my sister and isaac said for fear that i might be put to death because of her
 then abimelech said what have you done to us one of the people might well have had connection with your wife and the sin would have been ours
 and abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching isaac or his wife was to be put to death
 now isaac planting seed in that land got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much for the blessing of the lord was on him
 and his wealth became very great increasing more and more
 for he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants so that the philistines were full of envy
 now all the water holes which his fathers servants had made in the days of abraham had been stopped up with earth by the philistines
 and abimelech said to isaac go away from us for you are stronger than we are
 so isaac went away from there and put up his tents in the valley of gerar making his living place there
 and he made again the water holes which had been made in the days of abraham his father and which had been stopped up by the philistines and he gave them the names which his father had given them
 now isaacs servants made holes in the valley and came to a spring of flowing water
 but the herdmen of gerar had a fight with isaacs herdmen for they said the spring is ours so he gave the spring the name of esek because there was a fight about it
 then they made another water hole and there was a fight about that so he gave it the name of sitnah
 then he went away from there and made another water hole about which there was no fighting so he gave it the name of rehoboth for he said now the lord has made room for us and we will have fruit in this land
 and from there he went on to beer sheba
 that night the lord came to him in a vision and said i am the god of your father abraham have no fear for i am with you blessing you and your seed will be increased because of my servant abraham
 then he made an altar there and gave worship to the name of the lord and he put up his tents there and there his servants made a water hole
 and abimelech had come to him from gerar with ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his army
 and isaac said to them why have you come to me seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you
 and they said we saw clearly that the lord was with you so we said let there be an oath between us and you and let us make an agreement with you
 that you will do us no damage even as we put no hand on you and did you nothing but good and sent you away in peace and now the blessing of the lord is on you
 then he made a feast for them and they all had food and drink
 and early in the morning they took an oath one to the other then isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace
 and that day isaacs servants came to him and gave him word of the water hole which they had made and said to him we have come to water
 and he gave it the name of shibah so the name of that town is beer sheba to this day
 and when esau was forty years old he took as his wives judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite
 and isaac and rebekah had grief of mind because of them
 now when isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see he sent for esau his first son and said to him my son and he said here am i
 and he said see now i am old and my death may take place at any time
 so take your arrows and your bow and go out to the field and get meat for me
 and make me food good to the taste such as is pleasing to me and put it before me so that i may have a meal and give you my blessing before death comes to me
 now isaacs words to his son were said in rebekahs hearing then esau went out to get the meat
 and rebekah said to jacob her son your father said to your brother esau in my hearing
 go and get some roes meat and make me a good meal so that i may be full and give you my blessing before the lord before my death
 now my son do what i say
 go to the flock and get me two fat young goats and i will make of them a meal to your fathers taste
 and you will take it to him so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death
 and jacob said to rebekah his mother but esau my brother is covered with hair while i am smooth
 if by chance my father puts his hand on me it will seem to him that i am tricking him and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing
 and his mother said let the curse be on me my son only do as i say and go and get them for me
 so he went and got them and took them to his mother and she made a meal to his fathers taste
 and rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son which were with her in the house and put them on jacob her younger son
 and she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck
 and she gave into the hand of jacob her son the meat and the bread which she had made ready
 and he came to his father and said my father and he said here am i who are you my son
 and jacob said i am esau your oldest son i have done as you said come now be seated and take of my meat so that you may give me a blessing
 and isaac said how is it that you have got it so quickly my son and he said because the lord your god made it come my way
 and isaac said come near so that i may put my hand on you my son and see if you are truly my son esau or not
 and jacob went near his father isaac and he put his hands on him and he said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau
 and he did not make out who he was because his hands were covered with hair like his brother esaus hands so he gave him a blessing
 and he said are you truly my son esau and he said i am
 and he said put it before me and i will take of my sons meat so that i may give you a blessing and he put it before him and he took it and he gave him wine and he had a drink
 and his father isaac said to him come near now my son and give me a kiss
 and he came near and gave him a kiss and smelling the smell of his clothing he gave him a blessing and said see the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the lord has come
 may god give you the dew of heaven and the good things of the earth and grain and wine in full measure
 let peoples be your servants and nations go down before you be lord over your brothers and let your mothers sons go down before you a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed and a blessing on those who give you a blessing
 and when isaac had come to the end of blessing jacob and jacob had not long gone away from isaac his father esau came in from the field
 and he made ready a meal good to the taste and took it to his father and said to him let my father get up and take of his sons meat so that you may give me a blessing
 and isaac his father said to him who are you and he said i am your oldest son esau
 and in great fear isaac said who then is he who got meat and put it before me and i took it all before you came and gave him a blessing and his it will be
 and hearing the words of his father esau gave a great and bitter cry and said to his father give a blessing to me even to me o my father 
 and he said your brother came with deceit and took away your blessing
 and he said is it because he is named jacob that he has twice taken my place for he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing and he said have you not kept a blessing for me
 and isaac answering said but i have made him your master and have given him all his brothers for servants i have made him strong with grain and wine what then am i to do for you my son
 and esau said to his father is that the only blessing you have my father give a blessing to me even me  and esau was overcome with weeping
 then isaac his father made answer and said to him far from the fertile places of the earth and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living place be
 by your sword will you get your living and you will be your brothers servant but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck
 so esau was full of hate for jacob because of his fathers blessing and he said in his heart the days of weeping for my father are near then i will put my brother jacob to death
 then rebekah hearing what esau had said sent for jacob her younger son and said to him it seems that your brother esau is purposing to put you to death
 so now my son do what i say go quickly to haran to my brother laban
 and be there with him for a little time till your brothers wrath is turned away
 till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry then i will send word for you to come back are the two of you to be taken from me in one day
 then rebekah said to isaac my life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of heth if jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of heth such as these the women of this land of what use will my life be to me
 then isaac sent for jacob and blessing him said do not take a wife from among the women of canaan
 but go to paddan aram to the house of bethuel your mothers father and there get yourself a wife from the daughters of laban your mothers brother
 and may god the ruler of all give you his blessing giving you fruit and increase so that you may become an army of peoples
 and may god give you the blessing of abraham to you and to your seed so that the land of your wanderings which god gave to abraham may be your heritage
 so isaac sent jacob away and he went to paddan aram to laban son of bethuel the aramaean the brother of rebekah the mother of jacob and esau
 so when esau saw that isaac had given jacob his blessing and sent him away to paddan aram to get a wife for himself there blessing him and saying to him do not take a wife from among the women of canaan
 and that jacob had done as his father and mother said and had gone to paddan aram
 it was clear to esau that his father had no love for the women of canaan
 so esau went to ishmael and took mahalath the daughter of abrahams son ishmael the sister of nebaioth to be his wife in addition to the wives he had
 so jacob went out from beer sheba to go to haran
 and coming to a certain place he made it his resting place for the night for the sun had gone down and he took one of the stones which were there and putting it under his head he went to sleep in that place
 and he had a dream and in his dream he saw steps stretching from earth to heaven and the angels of god were going up and down on them
 and he saw the lord by his side saying i am the lord the god of abraham your father and the god of isaac i will give to you and to your seed this land on which you are sleeping
 your seed will be like the dust of the earth covering all the land to the west and to the east to the north and to the south you and your seed will be a name of blessing to all the families of the earth
 and truly i will be with you and will keep you wherever you go guiding you back again to this land and i will not give you up till i have done what i have said to you
 and jacob awaking from his sleep said truly the lord is in this place and i was not conscious of it
 and fear came on him and he said this is a holy place this is nothing less than the house of god and the doorway of heaven
 and early in the morning jacob took the stone which had been under his head and put it up as a pillar and put oil on it
 and he gave that place the name of beth el but before that time the town was named luz
 then jacob took an oath and said if god will be with me and keep me safe on my journey and give me food and clothing to put on
 so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then i will take the lord to be my god
 and this stone which i have put up for a pillar will be gods house and of all you give me i will give a tenth part to you
 then jacob went on his journey till he came to the land of the children of the east
 and there he saw a water hole in a field and by the side of it three flocks of sheep for there they got water for the sheep and on the mouth of the water hole there was a great stone
 and all the flocks would come together there and when the stone had been rolled away they would give the sheep water and put the stone back again in its place on the mouth of the water hole
 then jacob said to the herdmen my brothers where do you come from and they said from haran
 and he said to them have you any knowledge of laban the son of nahor and they said we have
 and he said to them is he well and they said he is well and here is rachel his daughter coming with the sheep
 then jacob said the sun is still high and it is not time to get the cattle together get water for the sheep and go and give them their food
 and they said we are not able to do so till all the flocks have come together and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the water hole then we will get water for the sheep
 while he was still talking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she took care of them
 then when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother coming with labans sheep he came near and rolling the stone away from the mouth of the hole he got water for labans flock
 and weeping for joy jacob gave rachel a kiss
 and rachel hearing from jacob that he was her fathers relation and that he was the son of rebekah went running to give her father news of it
 and laban hearing news of jacob his sisters son came running and took jacob in his arms and kissing him made him come into his house and jacob gave him news of everything
 and laban said to him truly you are my bone and my flesh and he kept jacob with him for the space of a month
 then laban said to jacob because you are my brother are you to be my servant for nothing say now what is your payment to be
 now laban had two daughters the name of the older was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
 and leahs eyes were clouded but rachel was fair in face and form
 and jacob was in love with rachel and he said i will be your servant seven years for rachel your younger daughter
 and laban said it is better for you to have her than another man go on living here with me
 and jacob did seven years work for rachel and because of his love for her it seemed to him only a very little time
 then jacob said to laban give me my wife so that i may have her for the days are ended
 and laban got together all the men of the place and gave a feast
 and in the evening he took leah his daughter and gave her to him and he went in to her
 and laban gave zilpah his servant girl to leah to be her waiting woman
 and in the morning jacob saw that it was leah and he said to laban what have you done to me was i not working for you so that i might have rachel why have you been false to me
 and laban said in our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older
 let the week of the bride feast come to its end and then we will give you the other in addition if you will be my servant for another seven years
 and jacob did so and when the week was ended laban gave him his daughter rachel for his wife
 and laban gave rachel his servant girl bilhah to be her waiting woman
 then jacob took rachel as his wife and his love for her was greater than his love for leah and he went on working for laban for another seven years
 now the lord seeing that leah was not loved gave her a child while rachel had no children
 and leah was with child and gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name reuben for she said the lord has seen my sorrow now my husband will have love for me
 then she became with child again and gave birth to a son and said because it has come to the lords ears that i am not loved he has given me this son in addition and she gave him the name simeon
 and she was with child again and gave birth to a son and said now at last my husband will be united to me because i have given him three sons so he was named levi
 and she was with child again and gave birth to a son and she said this time i will give praise to the lord so he was named judah after this she had no more children for a time
 now the snake was wiser than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said to the woman has god truly said that you may not take of the fruit of any tree in the garden
 and the woman said we may take of the fruit of the trees in the garden
 but of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden god has said if you take of it or put your hands on it death will come to you
 and the snake said death will not certainly come to you
 for god sees that on the day when you take of its fruit your eyes will be open and you will be as gods having knowledge of good and evil
 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and a delight to the eyes and to be desired to make one wise she took of its fruit and gave it to her husband
 and their eyes were open and they were conscious that they had no clothing and they made themselves coats of leaves stitched together
 and there came to them the sound of the lord god walking in the garden in the evening wind and the man and his wife went to a secret place among the trees of the garden away from the eyes of the lord god
 and the voice of the lord god came to the man saying where are you
 and he said hearing your voice in the garden i was full of fear because i was without clothing and i kept myself from your eyes
 and he said who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing have you taken of the fruit of the tree which i said you were not to take
 and the man said the woman whom you gave to be with me she gave me the fruit of the tree and i took it
 and the lord god said to the woman what have you done and the woman said i was tricked by the deceit of the snake and i took it
 and the lord god said to the snake because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field you will go flat on the earth and dust will be your food all the days of your life
 and there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded
 to the woman he said great will be your pain in childbirth in sorrow will your children come to birth still your desire will be for your husband but he will be your master
 and to adam he said because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which i said you were not to take the earth is cursed on your account in pain you will get your food from it all your life
 thorns and waste plants will come up and the plants of the field will be your food
 with the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken for dust you are and to the dust you will go back
 and the man gave his wife the name of eve because she was the mother of all who have life
 and the lord god made for adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing
 and the lord god said now the man has become like one of us having knowledge of good and evil and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life he will go on living for ever
 so the lord god sent him out of the garden of eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken
 so he sent the man out and at the east of the garden of eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life
 now rachel because she had no children was full of envy of her sister and she said to jacob if you do not give me children i will not go on living
 but jacob was angry with rachel and said am i in the place of god who has kept your body from having fruit
 then she said here is my servant bilhah go in to her so that she may have a child on my knees and i may have a family by her
 so she gave him her servant bilhah as a wife and jacob went in to her
 and bilhah became with child and gave birth to a son
 then rachel said god has been my judge and has given ear to my voice and has given me a son so he was named dan
 and again bilhah rachels servant was with child and gave birth to a second son
 and rachel said i have had a great fight with my sister and i have overcome her and she gave the child the name naphtali
 when it was clear to leah that she would have no more children for a time she gave zilpah her servant to jacob as a wife
 and zilpah leahs servant gave birth to a son
 and leah said it has gone well for me and she gave him the name gad
 and zilpah leahs servant gave birth to a second son
 and leah said happy am i  and all women will give witness to my joy and she gave him the name asher
 now at the time of the grain cutting reuben saw some love fruits in the field and took them to his mother leah and rachel said to her let me have some of your sons love fruits
 but leah said to her is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me and now would you take my sons love fruits then rachel said you may have him tonight in exchange for your sons love fruits
 in the evening when jacob came in from the field leah went out to him and said tonight you are to come to me for i have given my sons love fruits as a price for you and he went in to her that night
 and god gave ear to her and she became with child and gave jacob a fifth son
 then leah said god has made payment to me for giving my servant girl to my husband so she gave her son the name issachar
 and again leah became with child and she gave jacob a sixth son
 and she said god has given me a good bride price now at last will i have my husband living with me for i have given him six sons and she gave him the name zebulun
 after that she had a daughter to whom she gave the name dinah
 then god gave thought to rachel and hearing her prayer he made her fertile
 and she was with child and gave birth to a son and she said god has taken away my shame
 and she gave him the name joseph saying may the lord give me another son
 now after the birth of joseph jacob said to laban let me go away to my place and my country
 give me my wives and my children for whom i have been your servant and let me go for you have knowledge of all the work i have done for you
 and laban said if you will let me say so do not go away for i have seen by the signs that the lord has been good to me because of you
 say then what your payment is to be and i will give it
 then jacob said you have seen what i have done for you and how your cattle have done well under my care
 for before i came you had little and it has been greatly increased and the lord has given you a blessing in everything i have done but when am i to do something for my family
 and laban said what am i to give you and jacob said do not give me anything but i will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me
 let me go through all your flock today taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black and all the marked or coloured goats these will be my payment
 and so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured or any sheep which is not black you may take me for a thief
 and laban said let it be as you say
 so that day he took all the he goats which were banded or coloured and all the she goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks and all the black sheep and gave them into the care of his sons
 and sent them three days journey away and jacob took care of the rest of labans flock
 then jacob took young branches of trees cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands
 and he put the banded sticks in the drinking places where the flock came to get water and they became with young when they came to the water
 and because of this the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour
 these lambs jacob kept separate and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with labans flock
 and whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking places so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks
 but when the flocks were feeble he did not put the sticks before them so that the feebler flocks were labans and the stronger were jacobs
 so jacobs wealth was greatly increased he had great flocks and women servants and men servants and camels and asses
 now it came to the ears of jacob that labans sons were saying jacob has taken away all our fathers property and in this way he has got all this wealth
 and jacob saw that labans feeling for him was no longer what it had been before
 then the lord said to jacob go back to the land of your fathers and to your relations and i will be with you
 and jacob sent for rachel and leah to come to him in the field among his flock
 and he said to them it is clear to me that your fathers feeling is no longer what it was to me but the god of my father has been with me
 and you have seen how i have done all in my power for your father
 but your father has not kept faith with me and ten times he has made changes in my payment but god has kept him from doing me damage
 if he said all those in the flock which have marks are to be yours then all the flock gave birth to marked young and if he said all the banded ones are to be yours then all the flock had banded young
 so god has taken away your fathers cattle and has given them to me
 and at the time when the flock were with young i saw in a dream that all the he goats which were joined with the she goats were banded and marked and coloured
 and in my dream the angel of the lord said to me jacob and i said here am i
 and he said see how all the he goats are banded and marked and coloured for i have seen what laban has done to you
 i am the god of beth el where you put oil on the pillar and took an oath to me now then come out of this land and go back to the country of your birth
 then rachel and leah said to him in answer what part or heritage is there for us in our fathers house
 are we not as people from a strange country to him for he took a price for us and now it is all used up
 for the wealth which god has taken from him is ours and our childrens so now whatever god has said to you do
 then jacob put his wives and his sons on camels
 and sending on before him all his cattle and his property which he had got together in paddan aram he made ready to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan
 now laban had gone to see to the cutting of the wool of his sheep so rachel secretly took the images of the gods of her fathers house
 and jacob went away secretly without giving news of his flight to laban the aramaean
 so he went away with all he had and went across the river in the direction of the hill country of gilead
 and on the third day laban had news of jacobs flight
 and taking the men of his family with him he went after him for seven days and overtook him in the hill country of gilead
 then god came to laban in a dream by night and said to him take care that you say nothing good or bad to jacob
 now when laban overtook him jacob had put up his tent in the hill country and laban and his brothers put up their tents in the hill country of gilead
 and laban said to jacob why did you go away secretly taking my daughters away like prisoners of war
 why did you make a secret of your flight not giving me word of it so that i might have sent you away with joy and songs with melody and music
 you did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters this was a foolish thing to do
 it is in my power to do you damage but the god of your father came to me this night saying take care that you say nothing good or bad to jacob
 and now it seems you are going because your hearts desire is for your fathers house but why have you taken my gods
 and jacob in answer said to laban my fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force
 as for your gods if anyone of us has them let him be put to death make search before us all for what is yours and take it for jacob had no knowledge that rachel had taken them
 so laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the tents of the two servant women but they were not there and he came out of leahs tent and went into rachels
 now rachel had taken the images and had put them in the camels basket and was seated on them and laban searching through all the tent did not come across them
 and she said to her father let not my lord be angry because i do not get up before you for i am in the common condition of women and with all his searching he did not come across the images
 then jacob was angry with laban and said what crime or sin have i done that you have come after me with such passion
 now that you have made search through all my goods what have you seen which is yours make it clear now before my people and your people so that they may be judges between us
 these twenty years i have been with you your sheep and your goats have had young without loss not one of your he goats have i taken for food
 anything which was wounded by beasts i did not take to you but myself made up for the loss of it you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves by day or by night
 this was my condition wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night and sleep went from my eyes
 these twenty years i have been in your house i was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters and for six years i kept your flock and ten times was my payment changed
 if the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had not been with me you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands but god has seen my troubles and the work of my hands and this night he kept you back
 then laban answering said these women are my daughters and these children my children the flocks and all you see are mine what now may i do for my daughters and for their children
 come let us make an agreement you and i and let it be for a witness between us
 then jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar
 and jacob said to his people get stones together and they did so and they had a meal there by the stones
 and the name laban gave it was jegar sahadutha but jacob gave it the name of galeed
 and laban said these stones are a witness between you and me today for this reason its name was galeed
 and mizpah for he said may the lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one anothers doings
 if you are cruel to my daughters or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters then though no man is there to see god will be the witness between us
 and laban said see these stones and this pillar which i have put between you and me
 they will be witness that i will not go over these stones to you and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me for any evil purpose
 may the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father be our judge then jacob took an oath by the fear of his father isaac
 and jacob made an offering on the mountain and gave orders to his people to take food so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain
 and early in the morning laban after kissing and blessing his daughters went on his way back to his country
 and on his way jacob came face to face with the angels of god
 and when he saw them he said this is the army of god so he gave that place the name of mahanaim
 now jacob sent servants before him to esau his brother in the land of seir the country of edom
 and he gave them orders to say these words to esau your servant jacob says till now i have been living with laban
 and i have oxen and asses and flocks and men servants and women servants and i have sent to give my lord news of these things so that i may have grace in his eyes
 when the servants came back they said we have seen your brother esau and he is coming out to you and four hundred men with him
 then jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups
 and said if esau meeting one group makes an attack on them the others will get away safely
 then jacob said o god of my father abraham the god of my father isaac the lord who said to me go back to your country and your family and i will be good to you
 i am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant for with only my stick in my hand i went across jordan and now i have become two armies
 be my saviour from the hand of esau my brother for my fear is that he will make an attack on me putting to death mother and child
 and you said truly i will be good to you and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered
 then he put up his tent there for the night and from among his goods he took as an offering for his brother esau
 two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep
 thirty camels with their young ones forty cows ten oxen twenty asses and ten young asses
 these he gave to his servants every herd by itself and he said to his servants go on before me and let there be a space between one herd and another
 and he gave orders to the first saying when my brother esau comes to you and says whose servant are you and where are you going and whose are these herds
 then say to him these are your servant jacobs they are an offering for my lord for esau and he himself is coming after us
 and he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds saying this is what you are to say to esau when you see him
 and you are to say further jacob your servant is coming after us for he said to himself i will take away his wrath by the offering which i have sent on and then i will come before him it may be that i will have grace in his eyes
 so the servants with the offerings went on in front and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people
 and in the night he got up and taking with him his two wives and the two servant women and his eleven children he went over the river jabbok
 he took them and sent them over the stream with all he had
 then jacob was by himself and a man was fighting with him till dawn
 but when the man saw that he was not able to overcome jacob he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg so that his leg was damaged
 and he said to him let me go now for the dawn is near but jacob said i will not let you go till you have given me your blessing
 then he said what is your name and he said jacob
 and he said your name will no longer be jacob but israel for in your fight with god and with men you have overcome
 then jacob said what is your name and he said what is my name to you then he gave him a blessing
 and jacob gave that place the name of peniel saying i have seen god face to face and still i am living
 and while he was going past peniel the sun came up and he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg
 for this reason the children of israel even today never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food because the hollow of jacobs leg was touched
 then jacob lifting up his eyes saw esau coming with his four hundred men so he made a division of the children between leah and rachel and the two women servants
 he put the servants and their children in front leah and her children after them and rachel and joseph at the back
 and he himself going before them went down on his face to the earth seven times till he came near his brother
 then esau came running up to him and folding him in his arms gave him a kiss and the two of them were overcome with weeping
 then esau lifting up his eyes saw the women and the children and said who are these with you and he said the children whom god in his mercy has given to your servant
 then the servants and their children came near and went down on their faces
 and leah came near with her children and then joseph and rachel and they did the same
 and he said what were all those herds which i saw on the way and jacob said they were an offering so that i might have grace in my lords eyes
 but esau said i have enough keep what is yours my brother for yourself
 and jacob said not so but if i have grace in your eyes take them as a sign of my love for i have seen your face as one may see the face of god and you have been pleased with me
 take my offering then with my blessing for god has been very good to me and i have enough so at his strong request he took it
 and he said let us go on our journey together and i will go in front
 but jacob said my lord may see that the children are only small and there are young ones in my flocks and herds one days over driving will be the destruction of all the flock
 do you my lord go on before your servant i will come on slowly at the rate at which the cattle and the children are able to go till i come to my lord at seir
 and esau said then keep some of my men with you and he said what need is there for that if my lord is pleased with me
 so esau turning back that day went on his way to seir
 and jacob went on to succoth where he made a house for himself and put up tents for his cattle for this reason the place was named succoth
 so jacob came safely from paddan aram to the town of shechem in the land of canaan and put up his tents near the town
 and for a hundred bits of money he got from the children of hamor the builder of shechem the field in which he had put up his tents
 and there he put up an altar naming it el the god of israel
 now dinah the daughter whom leah had by jacob went out to see the women of that country
 and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite who was the chief of that land saw her he took her by force and had connection with her
 then his heart went out in love to dinah the daughter of jacob and he said comforting words to her
 and shechem said to hamor his father get me this girl for my wife
 now jacob had word of what shechem had done to his daughter but his sons were in the fields with the cattle and jacob said nothing till they came
 then hamor the father of shechem came out to have a talk with jacob
 now the sons of jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in israel by having connection with jacobs daughter and they said such a thing is not to be done
 but hamor said to them shechem my son is full of desire for your daughter will you then give her to him for a wife
 and let our two peoples be joined together give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves
 go on living with us and the country will be open to you do trade and get property there
 and shechem said to her father and her brothers if you will give ear to my request whatever you say i will give to you
 however great you make the bride price and payment i will give it only let me have the girl for my wife
 but the sons of jacob gave a false answer to shechem and hamor his father because of what had been done to dinah their sister
 and they said it is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision for that would be a cause of shame to us
 but on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision
 then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people
 but if you will not undergo circumcision as we say then we will take our daughter and go
 and their words were pleasing to hamor and his son shechem
 and without loss of time the young man did as they said because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was the noblest of his fathers house
 then hamor and shechem his son went to the meeting place of their town and said to the men of the town
 it is the desire of these men to be at peace with us let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here for the country is wide open before them let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters
 but these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done
 then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us
 then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of hamor and shechem his son and every male in the town underwent circumcision
 but on the third day after before the wounds were well two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brothers took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death
 and hamor and his son they put to death with the sword and they took dinah from shechems house and went away
 and the sons of jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister
 they took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields
 and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives everything in their houses they took and made them waste
 and jacob said to simeon and levi you have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country among the canaanites and the perizzites and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me and it will be the end of me and all my people
 but they said were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman
 and god said to jacob go up now to beth el and make your living place there and put up an altar there to the god who came to you when you were in flight from your brother esau
 then jacob said to all his people put away the strange gods which are among you and make yourselves clean and put on a change of clothing
 and let us go up to beth el and there i will make an altar to god who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble and was with me wherever i went
 then they gave to jacob all the strange gods which they had and the rings which were in their ears and jacob put them away under the holy tree at shechem
 so they went on their journey and the fear of god was on the towns round about so that they made no attack on the sons of jacob
 and jacob came to luz in the land of canaan  which is the same as beth el  he and all his people
 and there he made an altar naming the place el beth el because it was there he had the vision of god when he was in flight from his brother
 and deborah the servant who had taken care of rebekah from her birth came to her end and was put to rest near beth el under the holy tree and they gave it the name of allon bacuth
 now when jacob was on his way from paddan aram god came to him again and blessing him said
 jacob is your name but it will be so no longer from now your name will be israel so he was named israel
 and god said to him i am god the ruler of all be fertile and have increase a nation truly a group of nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring
 and the land which i gave to abraham and isaac i will give to you and to your seed after you i will give the land
 then god went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him
 and jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with god and put a drink offering on it and oil
 and he gave to the place where god had been talking with him the name of beth el
 so they went on from beth el and while they were still some distance from ephrath the pains of birth came on rachel and she had a hard time
 and when her pain was very great the woman who was helping her said have no fear for now you will have another son
 and in the hour when her life went from her  for death came to her  she gave the child the name ben oni but his father gave him the name of benjamin
 so rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to ephrath  which is beth lehem 
 and jacob put up a pillar on her resting place which is named the pillar of the resting place of rachel to this day
 and israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock
 now while they were living in that country reuben had connection with bilhah his fathers servant woman and israel had news of it
 now jacob had twelve sons the sons of leah reuben jacobs first son and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and zebulun
 the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin
 the sons of bilhah rachels servant dan and naphtali
 the sons of zilpah leahs servant gad and asher these are the sons whom jacob had in paddan aram
 and jacob came to his father isaac at mamre at kiriath arba that is hebron where abraham and isaac had been living
 and isaac was a hundred and eighty years old
 then isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his fathers people an old man after a long life and jacob and esau his sons put him in his last resting place
 now these are the generations of esau that is to say edom
 esaus wives were women of canaan adah the daughter of elon the hittite and oholibamah the daughter of anah the daughter of zibeon the hivite
 and basemath ishmaels daughter the sister of nebaioth

 esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the people of his house and his beasts and his cattle and all his goods which he had got together in the land of canaan and went into the land of seir away from his brother jacob
 for their wealth was so great that the land was not wide enough for the two of them and all their cattle

 oholibamah elah pinon
 kenaz teman mibzar
 magdiel iram these are the edomite chiefs in their places in their heritage this is esau the father of the edomites
 now jacob was living in the land where his father had made a place for himself in the land of canaan
 these are the generations of jacob joseph a boy seventeen years old was looking after the flock together with his brothers the sons of bilhah and zilpah his fathers wives and joseph gave their father a bad account of them
 now the love which israel had for joseph was greater than his love for all his other children because he got him when he was an old man and he had a long coat made for him
 and because his brothers saw that joseph was dearer to his father than all the others they were full of hate for him and would not say a kind word to him
 now joseph had a dream and he gave his brothers an account of it which made their hate greater than ever
 and he said to them let me give you the story of my dream
 we were in the field getting the grain stems together and my grain kept upright and yours came round and went down on the earth before mine
 and his brothers said to him are you to be our king will you have authority over us and because of his dream and his words their hate for him became greater than ever
 then he had another dream and gave his brothers an account of it saying i have had another dream the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me
 and he gave word of it to his father and his brothers but his father protesting said what sort of a dream is this am i and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you
 and his brothers were full of envy but his father kept his words in mind
 now his brothers went to keep watch over their fathers flock in shechem
 and israel said to joseph are not your brothers with the flock in shechem come i will send you to them and he said to him here am i
 and he said to him go now and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is then come back and give me word so he sent him out of the valley of hebron and he came to shechem
 and a man saw him wandering in the country and said to him what are you looking for
 and he said i am looking for my brothers please give me word of where they are keeping their flock
 and the man said they have gone away from here for they said in my hearing let us go to dothan so joseph went after them and came up with them at dothan
 but they saw him when he was a long way off and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death
 saying to one another see here comes this dreamer
 let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes and we will say an evil beast has put him to death then we will see what becomes of his dreams
 but reuben hearing these words got him out of their hands saying let us not take his life
 do not put him to a violent death but let him be placed in one of the holes this he said to keep him safe from their hands with the purpose of taking him back to his father again
 so when joseph came to his brothers they took off his long coat which he had on
 and they took him and put him in the hole now the hole had no water in it
 then seating themselves they took their meal and looking up they saw a travelling band of ishmaelites coming from gilead on their way to egypt with spices and perfumes on their camels
 and judah said to his brothers what profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood
 let us give him to these ishmaelites for a price and let us not put violent hands on him for he is our brother our flesh and his brothers gave ear to him
 and some traders from midian went by so pulling joseph up out of the hole they gave him to the ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver and they took him to egypt
 now when reuben came back to the hole joseph was not there and giving signs of grief
 he went back to his brothers and said the child is gone what am i to do
 then they took josephs coat and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death
 and they took the coat to their father and said we came across this is it your sons coat or not
 and he saw that it was and said it is my sons coat an evil beast has put him to death without doubt joseph has come to a cruel end
 then jacob giving signs of grief put on haircloth and went on weeping for his son day after day
 and all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort but he would not be comforted saying with weeping i will go down to the underworld to my son so great was his fathers sorrow for him
 and in egypt the men of midian gave him for a price to potiphar a captain of high position in pharaohs house
 now at that time judah went away from his brothers and became the friend of a man of adullam named hirah
 and there he saw the daughter of a certain man of canaan named shua and took her as his wife
 and she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name er
 and again she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name onan
 then she had another son to whom she gave the name shelah she was at chezib when the birth took place
 and judah took a wife for his first son er and her name was tamar
 now er judahs first son did evil in the eyes of the lord so that he put him to death
 then judah said to onan go in to your brothers wife and do what it is right for a husbands brother to do make her your wife and get offspring for your brother
 but onan seeing that the offspring would not be his went in to his brothers wife but let his seed go on to the earth so that he might not get offspring for his brother
 and what he did was evil in the eyes of the lord so that he put him to death like his brother
 then judah said to tamar his daughter in law go back to your fathers house and keep yourself as a widow till my son shelah becomes a man for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers so tamar went back to her fathers house
 and after a time bath shua judahs wife came to her end and after judah was comforted for her loss he went to timnah where they were cutting the wool of his sheep and his friend hirah of adullam went with him
 and when tamar had news that her father in law was going up to timnah to the wool cutting
 she took off her widows clothing and covering herself with her veil she took her seat near enaim on the road to timnah for she saw that shelah was now a man but she had not been made his wife
 when judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town because her face was covered
 and turning to her by the roadside he said to her let me come in to you for he had no idea that she was his daughter in law and she said what will you give me as my price
 and he said i will give you a young goat from the flock and she said what will you give me as a sign till you send it
 and he said what would you have and she said your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand so he gave them to her and went in to her and she became with child by him
 then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widows clothing
 then judah sent his friend hirah with the young goat to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman but she was not there
 and he put questions to the men of the place saying where is the loose woman who was in enaim by the wayside and they said there was no such woman there
 so he went back to judah and said i have not seen her and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there
 and judah said let her keep the things so that we may not be shamed i sent the young goat but you did not see the woman
 now about three months after this word came to judah that tamar his daughter in law had been acting like a loose woman and was with child and judah said take her out and let her be burned
 and while she was being taken out she sent word to her father in law saying the man whose property these things are is the father of my child say then whose are this ring and this cord and this stick
 then judah said openly that they were his and said she is more upright than i am for i did not give her to shelah my son and he had no more connection with her
 and when the time came for her to give birth it was clear that there were two children in her body
 and while she was in the act of giving birth one of them put out his hand and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand saying this one came out first
 but then he took his hand back again and his brother came first to birth and the woman said what an opening you have made for yourself  so he was named perez
 and then his brother came out with the red thread round his hand and he was named zerah
 now joseph was taken down to egypt and potiphar the egyptian a captain of high position in pharaohs house got him for a price from the ishmaelites who had taken him there
 and the lord was with joseph and he did well and he was living in the house of his master the egyptian
 and his master saw that the lord was with him making everything he did go well
 and having a high opinion of joseph as his servant he made him the overseer of his house and gave him control over all he had
 and from the time when he made him overseer and gave him control of all his property the blessing of the lord was with the egyptian because of joseph the blessing of the lord was on all he had in the house and in the field
 and he gave joseph control of all his property keeping no account of anything but only the food which was put before him now joseph was very beautiful in form and face
 and after a time his masters wife looking on joseph with desire said to him be my lover
 but he would not and said to her you see that my master keeps no account of what i do in his house and has put all his property in my control
 so that no one has more authority in this house than i have he has kept nothing back from me but you because you are his wife how then may i do this great wrong sinning against god
 and day after day she went on requesting joseph to come to her and be her lover but he would not give ear to her
 now one day he went into the house to do his work and not one of the men of the house was inside
 and pulling at his coat she said come to my bed but slipping out of his coat he went running away
 and when she saw that he had got away letting her keep his coat
 she sent for the men of her house and said to them see he has let a hebrew come here and make sport of us he came to my bed and i gave a loud cry
 and hearing it he went running out without his coat
 and she kept his coat by her till his master came back
 then she gave him the same story saying the hebrew servant whom you have taken into our house came in to make sport of me
 and when i gave a loud cry he went running out without his coat
 and hearing his wifes account of what his servant had done he became very angry
 and josephs master took him and put him in prison in the place where the kings prisoners were kept in chains and he was there in the prison house
 but the lord was with joseph and was good to him and made the keeper of the prison his friend
 and the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under josephs control and he was responsible for whatever was done there
 and the keeper of the prison gave no attention to anything which was under his care because the lord was with him and the lord made everything he did go well
 and the man had connection with eve his wife and she became with child and gave birth to cain and said i have got a man from the lord
 then again she became with child and gave birth to abel his brother and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a farmer
 and after a time cain gave to the lord an offering of the fruits of the earth
 and abel gave an offering of the young lambs of his flock and of their fat and the lord was pleased with abels offering
 but in cain and his offering he had no pleasure and cain was angry and his face became sad
 and the lord said to cain why are you angry and why is your face sad
 if you do well will you not have honour and if you do wrong sin is waiting at the door desiring to have you but do not let it be your master
 and cain said to his brother let us go into the field and when they were in the field cain made an attack on his brother abel and put him to death
 and the lord said to cain where is your brother abel and he said i have no idea am i my brothers keeper
 and he said what have you done the voice of your brothers blood is crying to me from the earth
 and now you are cursed from the earth whose mouth is open to take your brothers blood from your hand
 no longer will the earth give you her fruit as the reward of your work you will be a wanderer in flight over the earth
 and cain said my punishment is greater than my strength
 you have sent me out this day from the face of the earth and from before your face i will be a wanderer in flight over the earth and whoever sees me will put me to death
 and the lord said truly if cain is put to death seven lives will be taken for his and the lord put a mark on cain so that no one might put him to death
 and cain went away from before the face of the lord and made his living place in the land of nod on the east of eden
 and cain had connection with his wife and she became with child and gave birth to enoch and he made a town and gave the town the name of enoch after his son
 and enoch had a son irad and irad became the father of mehujael and mehujael became the father of methushael and methushael became the father of lamech
 and lamech had two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah
 and adah gave birth to jabal he was the father of such as are living in tents and keep cattle
 and his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all players on instruments of music
 and zillah gave birth to tubal cain who is the father of every maker of cutting instruments of brass and iron and the sister of tubal cain was naamah
 and lamech said to his wives adah and zillah give ear to my voice you wives of lamech give attention to my words for i would put a man to death for a wound and a young man for a blow
 if seven lives are to be taken as punishment for cains death seventy seven will be taken for lamechs
 and adam had connection with his wife again and she gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name of seth for she said god has given me another seed in place of abel whom cain put to death
 and seth had a son and he gave him the name of enosh at this time men first made use of the name of the lord in worship
 now after these things the chief servant who had the care of the wine and the chief bread maker in pharaohs house did something against pharaohs orders
 and pharaoh was angry with his two servants with the chief wine servant and the chief bread maker
 and he put them in prison under the care of the captain of the army in the same prison where joseph himself was shut up
 and the captain put them in josephs care and he did what was needed for them and they were kept in prison for some time
 and these two had a dream on the same night the chief wine servant and the chief bread maker of the king of egypt who were in prison the two of them had dreams with a special sense
 and in the morning when joseph came to them he saw that they were looking sad
 and he said to the servants of pharaoh who were in prison with him why are you looking so sad
 then they said to him we have had a dream and no one is able to give us the sense and joseph said does not the sense of dreams come from god what was your dream
 then the chief wine servant gave joseph an account of his dream and said in my dream i saw a vine before me
 and on the vine were three branches and it seemed as if it put out buds and flowers and from them came grapes ready for cutting
 and pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and crushing them into pharaohs cup gave the cup into pharaohs hand
 then joseph said this is the sense of your dream the three branches are three days
 after three days pharaoh will give you honour and put you back into your place and you will give him his cup as you did before when you were his wine servant
 but keep me in mind when things go well for you and be good to me and say a good word for me to pharaoh and get me out of this prison
 for truly i was taken by force from the land of the hebrews and i have done nothing for which i might be put in prison
 now when the chief bread maker saw that the first dream had a good sense he said to joseph i had a dream and in my dream there were three baskets of white bread on my head
 and in the top basket were all sorts of cooked meats for pharaoh and the birds were taking them out of the baskets on my head
 then joseph said this is the sense of your dream the three baskets are three days
 after three days pharaoh will take you out of prison hanging you on a tree so that your flesh will be food for birds
 now the third day was pharaohs birthday and he gave a feast for all his servants and he gave honour to the chief wine servant and the chief bread maker among the others
 and he put the chief wine servant back in his old place and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand
 but the chief bread maker was put to death by hanging as joseph had said
 but the wine servant did not keep joseph in mind or give a thought to him
 now after two years had gone by pharaoh had a dream and in his dream he was by the side of the nile
 and out of the nile came seven cows good looking and fat and their food was the river grass
 and after them seven other cows came out of the nile poor looking and thin and they were by the side of the other cows
 and the seven thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows then pharaoh came out of his sleep
 but he went to sleep again and had a second dream in which he saw seven heads of grain full and good all on one stem
 and after them came up seven other heads thin and wasted by the east wind
 and the seven thin heads made a meal of the good heads and when pharaoh was awake he saw it was a dream
 and in the morning his spirit was troubled and he sent for all the wise men of egypt and all the holy men and put his dream before them but no one was able to give him the sense of it
 then the chief wine servant said to pharaoh the memory of my sin comes back to me now
 pharaoh had been angry with his servants and had put me in prison in the house of the captain of the army together with the chief bread maker
 and we had a dream on the same night the two of us and the dreams had a special sense
 and there was with us a young hebrew the captains servant and when we put our dreams before him he gave us the sense of them
 and it came about as he said i was put back in my place and the bread maker was put to death by hanging
 then pharaoh sent for joseph and they took him quickly out of prison and when his hair had been cut and his dress changed he came before pharaoh
 and pharaoh said to joseph i have had a dream and no one is able to give me the sense of it now it has come to my ears that you are able to give the sense of a dream when it is put before you
 then joseph said without god there will be no answer of peace for pharaoh
 then pharaoh said in my dream i was by the side of the nile
 and out of the nile came seven cows fat and good looking and their food was the river grass
 then after them came seven other cows very thin and poor looking worse than any i ever saw in the land of egypt
 and the thin cows made a meal of the seven fat cows who came up first
 and even with the fat cows inside them they seemed as bad as before and so i came out of my sleep
 and again in a dream i saw seven heads of grain full and good coming up on one stem
 and then i saw seven other heads dry thin and wasted by the east wind coming up after them
 and the seven thin heads made a meal of the seven good heads and i put this dream before the wise men but not one of them was able to give me the sense of it
 then joseph said these two dreams have the same sense god has made clear to pharaoh what he is about to do
 the seven fat cows are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years the two have the same sense
 the seven thin and poor looking cows who came up after them are seven years and the seven heads of grain dry and wasted by the east wind are seven years when there will be no food
 as i said to pharaoh before god has made clear to him what he is about to do
 seven years are coming in which there will be great wealth of grain in egypt
 and after that will come seven years when there will not be enough food and the memory of the good years will go from mens minds and the land will be made waste by the bad years
 and men will have no memory of the good time because of the need which will come after for it will be very bitter
 and this dream came to pharaoh twice because this thing is certain and god will quickly make it come about
 and now let pharaoh make search for a man of wisdom and good sense and put him in authority over the land of egypt
 let pharaoh do this and let him put overseers over the land of egypt to put in store a fifth part of the produce of the land in the good years
 and let them get together all the food in those good years and make a store of grain under pharaohs control for the use of the towns and let them keep it
 and let that food be kept in store for the land till the seven bad years which are to come in egypt so that the land may not come to destruction through need of food
 and this seemed good to pharaoh and to all his servants
 then pharaoh said to his servants where may we get such a man as this a man in whom is the spirit of god
 and pharaoh said to joseph seeing that god has made all this clear to you there is no other man of such wisdom and good sense as you
 you then are to be over my house and all my people will be ruled by your word only as king will i be greater than you
 and pharaoh said to joseph see i have put you over all the land of egypt
 then pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on josephs hand and he had him clothed with the best linen and put a chain of gold round his neck
 and he made him take his seat in the second of his carriages and they went before him crying make way  so he made him ruler over all the land of egypt
 then pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh and without your order no man may do anything in all the land of egypt
 and pharaoh gave joseph the name of zaphnath paaneah and he gave him asenath the daughter of poti phera the priest of on to be his wife so joseph went through all the land of egypt
 now joseph was thirty years old when he came before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from before the face of pharaoh and went through all the land of egypt
 now in the seven good years the earth gave fruit in masses
 and joseph got together all the food of those seven years and made a store of food in the towns the produce of the fields round every town was stored up in the town
 so he got together a store of grain like the sand of the sea so great a store that after a time he gave up measuring it for it might not be measured
 and before the time of need joseph had two sons to whom asenath the daughter of poti phera priest of on gave birth
 and to the first he gave the name manasseh for he said god has taken away from me all memory of my hard life and of my fathers house
 and to the second he gave the name ephraim for he said god has given me fruit in the land of my sorrow
 and so the seven good years in egypt came to an end
 then came the first of the seven years of need as joseph had said and in every other land they were short of food but in the land of egypt there was bread
 and when all the land of egypt was in need of food the people came crying to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said to the people go to joseph and whatever he says to you do it
 and everywhere on the earth they were short of food then joseph opening all his store houses gave the people of egypt grain for money so great was the need of food in the land of egypt
 and all lands sent to egypt to joseph to get grain for the need was great over all the earth
 now jacob hearing that there was grain in egypt said to his sons why are you looking at one another
 and he said i have had news that there is grain in egypt go down there and get grain for us so that life and not death may be ours
 so josephs ten brothers went down to get grain from egypt
 but jacob did not send benjamin josephs brother with them for fear as he said that some evil might come to him
 and the sons of israel came with all the others to get grain for they were very short of food in the land of canaan
 now joseph was ruler over all the land and it was he who gave out the grain to all the people of the land and josephs brothers came before him and went down on their faces to the earth
 and when joseph saw his brothers it was clear to him who they were but he made himself strange to them and talking roughly to them said where do you come from and they said from the land of canaan to get food
 now though joseph saw that these were his brothers they had no idea who he was
 then the memory of his dreams about them came back to joseph and he said to them you have come secretly to see how poor the land is
 and they said to him not so my lord your servants have come with money to get food
 we are all one mans sons we are true men we have not come with any secret purpose
 and he said to them no but you have come to see how poor the land is
 then they said we your servants are twelve brothers sons of one man in the land of canaan the youngest of us is now with our father and one is dead
 and joseph said it is as i said you have come with some secret purpose
 but in this way will you be put to the test by the life of pharaoh you will not go away from this place till your youngest brother comes here
 send one of your number to get your brother and the rest of you will be kept in prison so that your words may be tested to see if you are true if not by the life of pharaoh your purpose is certainly secret
 so he put them in prison for three days
 and on the third day joseph said to them do this if you would keep your lives for i am a god fearing man
 if you are true men let one of you be kept in prison while you go and take grain for the needs of your families
 and come back to me with your youngest brother so that your words may be seen to be true and you will not be put to death this is what you are to do
 and they said to one another truly we did wrong to our brother for we saw his grief of mind and we did not give ear to his prayers that is why this trouble has come on us
 and reuben said to them did i not say to you do the child no wrong but you gave no attention so now punishment has come on us for his blood
 they were not conscious that the sense of their words was clear to joseph for he had been talking to them through one who had knowledge of their language
 and turning away from them he was overcome with weeping then he went on talking to them again and took simeon and put chains on him before their eyes
 then joseph gave orders for their bags to be made full of grain and for every mans money to be put back into his bag and for food to be given them for the journey which was done
 then they put the bags of grain on their asses and went away
 now at their nights resting place one of them opening his bag to give his ass some food saw his money in the mouth of the bag
 and he said to his brothers my money has been given back it is in my bag then their hearts became full of fear and turning to one another they said what is this which god has done to us
 so when they came to jacob their father in the land of canaan they gave him an account of all their experiences saying
 the man who is the ruler of the country was rough with us and put us in prison saying that we had come with a secret evil purpose
 and we said to him we are true men we have no evil designs
 we are twelve brothers sons of our father one is dead and the youngest is now with our father in the land of canaan
 and the ruler of the land said in this way i may be certain that you are true men let one of you be kept here with me while you go and take grain for the needs of your families
 and come back to me with your youngest brother then i will be certain that you are true men and i will give your brother back to you and let you do trade in the land
 and when they took the grain out of their bags it was seen that every mans parcel of money was in his bag and when they and their father saw the money they were full of fear
 and jacob their father said to them you have taken my children from me joseph is gone and simeon is gone and now you would take benjamin away all these things have come on me
 and reuben said put my two sons to death if i do not come back to you with him let him be in my care and i will give him safely back to you
 and he said i will not let my son go down with you for his brother is dead and he is all i have if evil overtakes him on the journey then through you will my grey head go down to the underworld in sorrow
 now the land was in bitter need of food
 and when the grain which they had got in egypt was all used up their father said to them go again and get us a little food
 and judah said to him the man said to us with an oath you are not to come before me again without your brother
 if you will let our brother go with us we will go down and get food
 but if you will not send him we will not go down for the man said to us you are not to come before me if your brother is not with you
 and israel said why were you so cruel to me as to say to him that you had a brother
 and they said the man put a number of questions to us about ourselves and our family saying is your father still living have you another brother and we had to give him answers how were we to have any idea that he would say come back with your brother
 then judah said to israel his father send the boy with me and let us be up and going so that we and you and our little ones may not come to destruction
 put him into my care and make me responsible for him if i do not give him safely back to you let mine be the sin for ever
 truly if we had not let the time go by we might have come back again by now
 then their father israel said to them if it has to be so then do this take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels to give the man perfumes and honey and spices and nuts
 and take twice as much money with you that is to say take back the money which was put in your bags for it may have been an error
 and take your brother and go back to the man
 and may god the ruler of all give you mercy before the man so that he may give you back your other brother and benjamin if my children are to be taken from me there is no help for it
 so they took what their father said for the man and twice as much money in their hands and benjamin and went on their journey to egypt and came before joseph
 and when joseph saw benjamin he said to his chief servant take these men into my house and make ready a meal for they will take food with me in the middle of the day
 and the servant did as joseph said and took the men into josephs house
 now the men were full of fear because they had been taken into josephs house and they said it is because of the money which was put back in our bags the first time he is looking for something against us so that he may come down on us and take us and our asses for his use
 so they went up to josephs chief servant at the door of the house
 and said o my lord we only came down the first time to get food
 and when we came to our nights resting place on opening our bags we saw that every mans money was in the mouth of his bag all our money in full weight and we have it with us to give it back
 as well as more money with which to get food we have no idea who put our money in our bags
 then the servant said peace be with you have no fear your god even the god of your father has put wealth in your bags for you i had your money then he let simeon come out to them
 and the servant took them into josephs house and gave them water for washing their feet and he gave their asses food
 and they got ready the things for joseph before he came in the middle of the day for word was given to them that they were to have a meal there
 and when joseph came in they gave him the things which they had for him and went down to the earth before him
 and he said how are you is your father well the old man of whom you were talking to me is he still living
 and they said your servant our father is well he is still living and they went down on their faces before him
 then lifting up his eyes he saw benjamin his brother his mothers son and he said is this your youngest brother of whom you gave me word and he said god be good to you my son
 then josephs heart went out to his brother and he went quickly into his room for he was overcome with weeping
 then after washing his face he came out and controlling his feelings said put food before us
 and they put a meal ready for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians who were with him by themselves because the egyptians may not take food with the hebrews for that would make them unclean
 and they were all given their seats before him in order of birth from the oldest to the youngest so that they were looking at one another in wonder
 and joseph sent food to them from his table but he sent five times as much to benjamin as to any of the others and they took wine freely with him
 then he gave orders to the servant who was over his house saying put as much food into the mens bags as will go into them and put every mans money in the mouth of his bag
 and put my cup my silver cup in the youngest ones bag with his money so he did as joseph said
 and at dawn the men with their asses were sent away
 and when they had gone only a little way out of the town joseph said to the servant who was over his house go after them and when you overtake them say to them why have you done evil in reward for good
 is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future truly you have done evil
 so he overtook them and said these words to them
 and they said to him why does my lord say such words as these far be it from your servants to do such a thing
 see the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from canaan how then might we take silver or gold from your lords house
 if it comes to light that any of your servants has done this let him be put to death and we will be your lords servants
 and he said let it be as you say he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant and you will not be responsible
 then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it
 and he made a search starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest and the cup was in benjamins bag
 then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town
 so judah and his brothers came to josephs house and he was still there and they went down on their faces before him
 and joseph said what is this thing which you have done had you no thought that such a man as i would have power to see what is secret
 and judah said what are we to say to my lord how may we put ourselves right in his eyes god has made clear the sin of your servants now we are in your hands we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen
 then he said far be it from me to do so but the man who had my cup will be my servant and you may go back to your father in peace
 then judah came near him and said let your servant say a word in my lords ears and let not your wrath be burning against your servant for you are in the place of pharaoh to us
 my lord said to his servants have you a father or a brother
 and we said to my lord we have an old father and a young child whom he had when he was old his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother and is very dear to his father
 and you said to your servants let him come down to me with you so that i may see him
 and we said to my lord his father will not let him go for if he went away his father would come to his death
 but you said to your servants if your youngest brother does not come with you you will not see my face again
 and when we went back to your servant our father we gave him an account of my lords words
 and our father said go again and get us a little food
 and we said only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down for we may not see the mans face again if our youngest brother is not with us
 and our father said to us you have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons
 the one went away from me and i said truly he has come to a violent death and from that time i have not seen him
 if now you take this one from me and some evil comes to him you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld
 if then i go back to your servant my father without the boy because his life and the boys life are one
 when he sees that the boy is not with us he will come to his death and our fathers grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld
 for i made myself responsible for the boy to my father saying if i do not give him safely back to you let mine be the sin for ever
 so now let me be my lords servant here in place of the boy and let him go back with his brothers
 for how may i go back to my father without the boy and see the evil which will come on my father
 then joseph unable to keep back his feelings before those who were with him gave orders for everyone to be sent away and no one was present when he made clear to his brothers who he was
 and so loud was his weeping that it came to the ears of the egyptians and all pharaohs house
 and joseph said to his brothers i am joseph is my father still living but his brothers were not able to give him an answer for they were troubled before him
 then joseph said to his brothers come near to me and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom you sent into egypt
 now do not be troubled or angry with yourselves for sending me away because god sent me before you to be the saviour of your lives
 for these two years have been years of need and there are still five more years to come in which there will be no ploughing or cutting of grain
 god sent me before you to keep you and yours living on earth so that you might become a great nation
 so now it was not you who sent me here but god and he has made me as a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt
 now go quickly to my father and say to him your son joseph says god has made me ruler over all the land of egypt come down to me straight away
 the land of goshen will be your living place and you will be near me you and your children and your childrens children and your flocks and herds and all you have
 and there i will take care of you so that you and your family may not be in need for there are still five bad years to come
 now truly your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin see that it is my mouth which says these things to you
 give my father word of all my glory in egypt and of all you have seen and come back quickly with my father
 then weeping he took benjamin in his arms and benjamin himself was weeping on josephs neck
 then he gave a kiss to all his brothers weeping over them and after that his brothers had no fear of talking to him
 and news of these things went through pharaohs house and it was said that josephs brothers were come and it seemed good to pharaoh and his servants
 and pharaoh said to joseph say to your brothers put your goods on your beasts and go back to the land of canaan
 and get your father and your families and come back to me and i will give you all the good things of egypt and the fat of the land will be your food
 and say to them this you are to do take carts from the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and get your father and come back
 and take no thought for your goods for the best of all the land of egypt is yours
 and the children of israel did as he said and joseph gave them carts as had been ordered by pharaoh and food for their journey
 to every one of them he gave three changes of clothing but to benjamin he gave three hundred bits of silver and five changes of clothing
 and to his father he sent ten asses with good things from egypt on their backs and ten she asses with grain and bread and food for his father on the journey
 and he sent his brothers on their way and said to them see that you have no argument on the road
 so they went up from egypt and came to the land of canaan to their father jacob
 and they said to him joseph is living and is ruler over all the land of egypt and at this word jacob was quite overcome for he had no faith in it
 and they gave him an account of everything joseph had said to them and when he saw the carts which joseph had sent for them his spirit came back to him
 and israel said it is enough joseph my son is still living i will go and see him before my death
 and israel went on his journey with all he had and came to beer sheba where he made offerings to the god of his father isaac
 and god said to israel in a night vision jacob jacob and he said here am i
 and he said i am god the god of your father go down to egypt without fear for i will make a great nation of you there
 i will go down with you to egypt and i will see that you come back again and at your death joseph will put his hands on your eyes
 then jacob went on from beer sheba and the sons of jacob took their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts which pharaoh had sent for them
 and they took their cattle and all the goods which they had got in the land of canaan and came to egypt even jacob and all his seed
 his sons and his sons sons his daughters and his daughters sons and all his family he took with him into egypt
 and these are the names of the children of israel who came into egypt even jacob and all his sons reuben jacobs oldest son
 and the sons of reuben hanoch and pallu and hezron and carmi
 and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a woman of canaan
 and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari
 and the sons of judah er and onan and shelah and perez and zerah but er and onan had come to their death in the land of canaan and the sons of perez were hezron and hamul
 and the sons of issachar tola and puah and job and shimron
 and the sons of zebulun sered and elon and jahleel
 all these together with his daughter dinah were the children of leah whom jacob had by her in paddan aram they were thirty three in number
 and the sons of gad ziphion and haggi shuni and ezbon eri and arodi and areli
 and the sons of asher jimnah and ishvah and ishvi and beriah and sarah their sister and the sons of beriah heber and malchiel
 these are the children of zilpah whom laban gave to his daughter leah and jacob had these sixteen children by her
 the sons of jacobs wife rachel joseph and benjamin
 and joseph had manasseh and ephraim in the land of egypt by asenath the daughter of poti phera priest of on
 and the sons of benjamin were belah and becher and ashbel gera and naaman ehi and rosh muppim and huppim and ard
 all these were the children of rachel whom jacob had by her fourteen persons
 and the son of dan was hushim
 and the sons of naphtali jahzeel and guni and jezer and shillem
 these were the children of bilhah whom laban gave to his daughter rachel seven persons
 all the persons who came with jacob into egypt the offspring of his body were sixty six without taking into account the wives of jacobs sons
 and the sons of joseph whom he had in egypt were two seventy persons of the family of jacob came into egypt
 now he had sent judah before him to goshen to get word from joseph and so they came to the land of goshen
 and joseph got his carriage ready and went to goshen for the meeting with his father and when he came before him he put his arms round his neck weeping
 and israel said to joseph now that i have seen you living again i am ready for death
 and joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers people i will go and give the news to pharaoh and say to him my brothers and my fathers people from the land of canaan have come to me
 and these men are keepers of sheep and owners of cattle and have with them their flocks and their herds and all they have
 now when pharaoh sends for you and says what is your business
 you are to say your servants have been keepers of cattle from our early days up to now like our fathers in this way you will be able to have the land of goshen for yourselves because keepers of sheep are unclean in the eyes of the egyptians
 then joseph went to pharaoh and said my father and my brothers with their flocks and their herds and all they have are come from canaan and are now in the land of goshen
 and he took five of his brothers to pharaoh
 and pharaoh said to them what is your business and they said your servants are keepers of sheep as our fathers were before us
 and they said to pharaoh we have come to make a living in this land because we have no grass for our flocks in the land of canaan so now let your servants make a place for themselves in the land of goshen
 and pharaoh said to joseph let them have the land of goshen and if there are any able men among them put them over my cattle
 and jacob and his sons came to joseph in egypt and when word of it came to the ears of pharaoh king of egypt he said to joseph your father and brothers have come to you all the land of egypt is before you let your father and your brothers have the best of the land for their resting place
 then joseph made his father jacob come before pharaoh and jacob gave him his blessing
 and pharaoh said to him how old are you
 and jacob said the years of my wanderings have been a hundred and thirty small in number and full of sorrow have been the years of my life and less than the years of the wanderings of my fathers
 and jacob gave pharaoh his blessing and went out from before him
 and joseph made a place for his father and his brothers and gave them a heritage in the land of egypt in the best of the land the land of rameses as pharaoh had given orders
 and joseph took care of his father and his brothers and all his fathers people giving them food for the needs of their families
 now there was no food to be had in all the land so that all egypt and canaan were wasted from need of food
 and all the money in egypt and in the land of canaan which had been given for grain came into the hands of joseph and he put it in pharaohs house
 and when all the money in egypt and canaan was gone the egyptians came to joseph and said give us bread would you have us come to destruction before your eyes for we have no more money
 and joseph said give me your cattle i will give you grain in exchange for your cattle if your money is all gone
 so they took their cattle to joseph and he gave them bread in exchange for their horses and flocks and herds and asses so all that year he gave them food in exchange for their cattle
 and when that year was ended they came to him in the second year and said we may not keep it from our lords knowledge that all our money is gone and all the herds of cattle are my lords there is nothing more to give my lord but our bodies and our land
 are we to come to destruction before your eyes we and our land take us and our land and give us bread and we and our land will be servants to pharaoh and give us seed so that we may have life and the land may not become waste
 so joseph got all the land in egypt for pharaoh for every egyptian gave up his land in exchange for food because of their great need so all the land became pharaohs
 and as for the people he made servants of them town by town from one end of egypt to the other
 only he did not take the land of the priests for the priests had their food given them by pharaoh and having what pharaoh gave them they had no need to give up their land
 then joseph said to the people i have made you and your land this day the property of pharaoh here is seed for you to put in your fields
 and when the grain is cut you are to give a fifth part to pharaoh and four parts will be yours for seed and food and for your families and your little ones
 and they said to him truly you have kept us from death may we have grace in your eyes and we will be pharaohs servants
 then joseph made a law which is in force to this day that pharaoh was to have the fifth part only the land of the priests did not become his
 and so israel was living among the egyptians in the land of goshen and they got property there and became very great in numbers and in wealth
 and jacob was living in the land of goshen for seventeen years so the years of his life were a hundred and forty seven
 and the time of his death came near and he sent for his son joseph and said to him if now i am dear to you put your hand under my leg and take an oath that you will not put me to rest in egypt
 but when i go to my fathers you are to take me out of egypt and put me to rest in their last resting place and he said i will do so
 and he said take an oath to me and he took an oath to him and israel gave worship on the beds head
 now after these things word came to joseph that his father was ill and he took with him his sons manasseh and ephraim
 and when they said to jacob your son joseph is coming to see you then israel getting all his strength together had himself lifted up in his bed
 and jacob said to joseph god the ruler of all came to me in a vision at luz in the land of canaan and gave me his blessing
 and said to me truly i will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations and i will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever
 and now your two sons who came to birth in egypt before i came to you here are mine ephraim and manasseh will be mine in the same way as reuben and simeon are
 and any other offspring which you have after them will be yours and will be named after their brothers in their heritage
 and as for me when i came from paddan death overtook rachel on the way when we were still some distance from ephrath and i put her to rest there on the road to ephrath which is beth lehem
 then israel looking at josephs sons said who are these
 and joseph said to his father they are my sons whom god has given me in this land and he said let them come near me and i will give them a blessing
 now because israel was old his eyes were no longer clear and he was not able to see so he made them come near to him and he gave them a kiss folding them in his arms
 and israel said to joseph i had no hope of seeing your face again but god in his mercy has let me see you and your children
 then joseph took them from between his knees and went down on his face to the earth
 then taking ephraim with his right hand joseph put him at israels left side and with his left hand he put manasseh at israels right side placing them near him
 and israel stretching out his right hand put it on the head of ephraim the younger and his left hand on the head of manasseh crossing his hands on purpose for manasseh was the older
 and he gave joseph a blessing saying may the god to whom my fathers abraham and isaac gave worship the god who has taken care of me all my life till this day
 the angel who has been my saviour from all evil send his blessing on these children and let my name and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac be given to them and let them become a great nation in the earth
 now when joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of ephraim it did not seem right to him and lifting his fathers hand he would have put it on the head of manasseh
 and joseph said to his father not so my father for this is the older put your right hand on his head
 but his father would not saying i am doing it on purpose my son he will certainly become a nation and a great one but his younger brother will be greater than he and his seed will become a great family of nations
 so he gave them his blessing that day saying you will be the sign of blessing in israel for they will say may god make you like ephraim and manasseh and he put ephraim before manasseh
 then israel said to joseph now my death is near but god will be with you guiding you back to the land of your fathers
 and i have given you more than your brothers even shechem as your heritage which i took from the amorites with my sword and my bow
 and jacob sent for his sons and said come together all of you so that i may give you news of your fate in future times
 come near o sons of jacob and give ear to the words of israel your father
 reuben you are my oldest son the first fruit of my strength first in pride and first in power
 but because you were uncontrolled the first place will not be yours for you went up to your fathers bed even his bride bed and made it unclean
 simeon and levi are brothers deceit and force are their secret designs
 take no part in their secrets o my soul keep far away o my heart from their meetings for in their wrath they put men to death and for their pleasure even oxen were wounded
 a curse on their passion for it was bitter and on their wrath for it was cruel i will let their heritage in jacob be broken up driving them from their places in israel
 to you judah will your brothers give praise your hand will be on the neck of your haters your fathers sons will go down to the earth before you
 judah is a young lion like a lion full of meat you have become great my son now he takes his rest like a lion stretched out and like an old lion by whom will his sleep be broken
 the rod of authority will not be taken from judah and he will not be without a law giver till he comes who has the right to it and the peoples will put themselves under his rule
 knotting his asss cord to the vine and his young ass to the best vine washing his robe in wine and his clothing in the blood of grapes
 his eyes will be dark with wine and his teeth white with milk
 the resting place of zebulun will be by the sea and he will be a harbour for ships the edge of his land will be by zidon
 issachar is a strong ass stretched out among the flocks
 and he saw that rest was good and the land was pleasing so he let them put weights on his back and became a servant
 dan will be the judge of his people as one of the tribes of israel
 may dan be a snake in the way a horned snake by the road biting the horses foot so that the horseman has a fall
 i have been waiting for your salvation o lord
 gad an army will come against him but he will come down on them in their flight
 ashers bread is fat he gives delicate food for kings
 naphtali is a roe let loose giving fair young ones
 joseph is a young ox whose steps are turned to the fountain
 he was troubled by the archers they sent out their arrows against him cruelly wounding him
 but their bows were broken by a strong one and the cords of their arms were cut by the strength of jacob by the name of the stone of israel
 even by the god of your father who will be your help and by the ruler of all who will make you full with blessings from heaven on high blessings of the deep stretched out under the earth blessings of the breasts and of the fertile body
 blessings of sons old and young to the father blessings of the oldest mountains and the fruit of the eternal hills let them come on the head of joseph on the crown of him who was separate from his brothers
 benjamin is a wolf searching for meat in the morning he takes his food and in the evening he makes division of what he has taken
 these are the twelve tribes of israel and these are the words their father said to them blessing them to every one he gave his blessing
 and he gave orders to them saying put me to rest with my people and with my fathers in the hollow of the rock in the field of ephron the hittite
 in the rock in the field of machpelah near mamre in the land of canaan which abraham got from ephron the hittite to be his resting place
 there abraham and sarah his wife were put to rest and there they put isaac and rebekah his wife and there i put leah to rest
 in the rock in the field which was got for a price from the people of heth
 and when jacob had come to the end of these words to his sons stretching himself on his bed he gave up his spirit and went the way of his people
 this is the book of the generations of adam in the day when god made man he made him in the image of god
 male and female he made them naming them man and giving them his blessing on the day when they were made
 adam had been living for a hundred and thirty years when he had a son like himself after his image and gave him the name of seth
 and after the birth of seth adam went on living for eight hundred years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of adams life were nine hundred and thirty and he came to his end
 and seth was a hundred and five years old when he became the father of enosh
 and he went on living after the birth of enosh for eight hundred and seven years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of seths life were nine hundred and twelve and he came to his end
 and enosh was ninety years old when he became the father of kenan
 and after the birth of kenan enosh went on living for eight hundred and fifteen years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of enosh were nine hundred and five and he came to his end
 and kenan was seventy years old when he became the father of mahalalel
 and after the birth of mahalalel kenan went on living for eight hundred and forty years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of kenans life were nine hundred and ten and he came to his end
 and mahalalel was sixty five years old when he became the father of jared
 and after the birth of jared mahalalel went on living for eight hundred and thirty years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of mahalalels life were eight hundred and ninety five and he came to his end
 and jared was a hundred and sixty two years old when he became the father of enoch
 and jared went on living after the birth of enoch for eight hundred years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of jareds life were nine hundred and sixty two and he came to his end
 and enoch was sixty five years old when he became the father of methuselah
 and after the birth of methuselah enoch went on in gods ways for three hundred years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of enochs life were three hundred and sixty five
 and enoch went on in gods ways and he was not seen again for god took him
 and methuselah was a hundred and eighty seven years old when he became the father of lamech
 and after the birth of lamech methuselah went on living for seven hundred and eighty two years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of methuselahs life were nine hundred and sixty nine and he came to his end
 and lamech was a hundred and eighty two years old when he had a son
 and he gave him the name of noah saying truly he will give us rest from our trouble and the hard work of our hands because of the earth which was cursed by god
 and after the birth of noah lamech went on living for five hundred and ninety five years and had sons and daughters
 and all the years of lamechs life were seven hundred and seventy seven and he came to his end
 and when noah was five hundred years old he became the father of shem ham and japheth
 and joseph put his head down on his fathers face weeping and kissing him
 and joseph gave orders to his servants who had the necessary knowledge to make his fathers body ready folding it in linen with spices and they did so
 and the forty days needed for making the body ready went by and there was weeping for him among the egyptians for seventy days
 and when the days of weeping for him were past joseph said to the servants of pharaoh if now you have love for me say these words to pharaoh
 my father made me take an oath saying when i am dead put me to rest in the place i have made ready for myself in the land of canaan so now let me go and put my father in his last resting place and i will come back again
 and pharaoh said go up and put your father to rest as you gave your oath to him
 so joseph went up to put his father in his last resting place and with him went all the servants of pharaoh and the chief men of his house and all the chiefs of the land of egypt
 and all the family of joseph and his brothers and his fathers people only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of goshen
 and carriages went up with him and horsemen a great army
 and they came to the grain floor of atad on the other side of jordan and there they gave the last honours to jacob with great and bitter sorrow weeping for their father for seven days
 and when the people of the land the people of canaan at the grain floor of atad saw their grief they said great is the grief of the egyptians so the place was named abel mizraim on the other side of jordan
 so his sons did as he had given them orders to do
 for they took him into the land of canaan and put him to rest in the hollow rock in the field of machpelah which abraham got with the field for a resting place from ephron the hittite at mamre
 and when his father had been put to rest joseph and his brothers and all who had gone with him went back to egypt
 now after the death of their father josephs brothers said to themselves it may be that josephs heart will be turned against us and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him
 so they sent word to joseph saying your father before his death gave us orders saying
 you are to say to joseph let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked and the evil they did to you now if it is your pleasure let the sin of the servants of your fathers god have forgiveness and at these words joseph was overcome with weeping
 then his brothers went and falling at his feet said truly we are your servants
 and joseph said have no fear am i in the place of god
 as for you it was in your mind to do me evil but god has given a happy outcome the salvation of numbers of people as you see today
 so now have no fear for i will take care of you and your little ones so he gave them comfort with kind words
 now joseph and all his fathers family went on living in egypt and the years of josephs life were a hundred and ten
 and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation and the children of machir the son of manasseh came to birth on josephs knees
 then joseph said to his brothers the time of my death has come but god will keep you in mind and take you out of this land into the land which he gave by his oath to abraham and isaac and jacob
 then joseph made the children of israel take an oath saying god will certainly give effect to his word and you are to take my bones away from here
 so joseph came to his death being a hundred and ten years old and they made his body ready and he was put in a chest in egypt
 and after a time when men were increasing on the earth and had daughters
 the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were fair and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them
 and the lord said my spirit will not be in man for ever for he is only flesh so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years
 there were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days and after that when the sons of god had connection with the daughters of men they gave birth to children these were the great men of old days the men of great name
 and the lord saw that the sin of man was great on the earth and that all the thoughts of his heart were evil
 and the lord had sorrow because he had made man on the earth and grief was in his heart
 and the lord said i will take away man whom i have made from the face of the earth even man and beast and that which goes on the earth and every bird of the air for i have sorrow for having made them
 but noah had grace in the eyes of god
 these are the generations of noah noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation he went in the ways of god
 and noah had three sons shem ham and japheth
 and the earth was evil in gods eyes and full of violent ways
 and god looking on the earth saw that it was evil for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth
 and god said to noah the end of all flesh has come the earth is full of their violent doings and now i will put an end to them with the earth
 make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it and make it safe from the water inside and out
 and this is the way you are to make it it is to be three hundred cubits long fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high
 you are to put a window in the ark a cubit from the roof and a door in the side of it and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors
 for truly i will send a great flow of waters over the earth for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life everything on the earth will come to an end
 but with you i will make an agreement and you will come into the ark you and your sons and your wife and your sons wives with you
 and you will take with you into the ark two of every sort of living thing and keep them safe with you they will be male and female
 two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction
 and make a store of every sort of food for yourself and them
 and all these things noah did as god said so he did
 and the lord said to noah take all your family and go into the ark for you only in this generation have i seen to be upright
 of every clean beast you will take seven males and seven females and of the beasts which are not clean two the male and his female
 and of the birds of the air seven males and seven females so that their seed may still be living on the face of the earth
 for after seven days i will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights for the destruction of every living thing which i have made on the face of the earth
 and noah did everything which the lord said he was to do
 and noah was six hundred years old when the waters came flowing over all the earth
 and noah with his sons and his wife and his sons wives went into the ark because of the flowing of the waters
 of clean beasts and of beasts which are not clean and of birds and of everything which goes on the earth
 in twos male and female they went into the ark with noah as god had said
 and after the seven days the waters came over all the earth
 in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month all the fountains of the great deep came bursting through and the windows of heaven were open
 and rain came down on the earth for forty days and forty nights
 on the same day noah with shem ham and japheth his sons and his wife and his sons wives went into the ark
 and with them every sort of beast and cattle and every sort of thing which goes on the earth and every sort of bird
 they went with noah into the ark two and two of all flesh in which is the breath of life
 male and female of all flesh went in as god had said and the ark was shut by the lord
 and for forty days the waters were over all the earth and the waters were increased so that the ark was lifted up high over the earth
 and the waters overcame everything and were increased greatly on the earth and the ark was resting on the face of the waters
 and the waters overcame everything on the earth and all the mountains under heaven were covered
 the waters went fifteen cubits higher till all the mountains were covered
 and destruction came on every living thing moving on the earth birds and cattle and beasts and everything which went on the earth and every man
 everything on the dry land in which was the breath of life came to its end
 every living thing on the face of all the earth man and cattle and things moving on the face of the earth and birds of the air came to destruction only noah and those who were with him in the ark were kept from death
 and the waters were over the earth a hundred and fifty days
 and god kept noah in mind and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark and god sent a wind over the earth and the waters went down
 and the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were shut and the rain from heaven was stopped
 and the waters went slowly back from the earth and at the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were lower
 and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of ararat
 and still the waters went on falling till on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen
 then after forty days through the open window of the ark which he had made
 noah sent out a raven which went this way and that till the waters were gone from the earth
 and he sent out a dove to see if the waters had gone from the face of the earth
 but the dove saw no resting place for her foot and came back to the ark for the waters were still over all the earth and he put out his hand and took her into the ark
 and after waiting another seven days he sent the dove out again
 and the dove came back at evening and in her mouth was an olive leaf broken off so noah was certain that the waters had gone down on the earth
 and after seven days more he sent the dove out again but she did not come back to him
 and in the six hundred and first year on the first day of the first month the waters were dry on the earth and noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry
 and on the twenty seventh day of the second month the earth was dry
 and god said to noah
 go out of the ark you and your wife and your sons and your sons wives
 take out with you every living thing which is with you birds and cattle and everything which goes on the earth so that they may have offspring and be fertile and be increased on the earth
 and noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons wives
 and every beast and bird and every living thing of every sort which goes on the earth went out of the ark
 and noah made an altar to the lord and from every clean beast and bird he made burned offerings on the altar
 and when the sweet smell came up to the lord he said in his heart i will not again put a curse on the earth because of man for the thoughts of mans heart are evil from his earliest days never again will i send destruction on all living things as i have done
 while the earth goes on seed time and the getting in of the grain cold and heat summer and winter day and night will not come to an end
 and god gave his blessing to noah and his sons and said be fertile and have increase and make the earth full
 and the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air everything which goes on the land and all the fishes of the sea are given into your hands
 every living and moving thing will be food for you i give them all to you as before i gave you all green things
 but flesh with the life blood in it you may not take for food
 and for your blood which is your life will i take payment from every beast i will take it and from every man will i take payment for the blood of his brother man
 whoever takes a mans life by man will his life be taken because god made man in his image
 and now be fertile and have increase have offspring on the earth and become great in number
 and god said to noah and to his sons
 truly i will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you
 and with every living thing with you all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you
 and i will make my agreement with you never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction
 and god said this is the sign of the agreement which i make between me and you and every living thing with you for all future generations
 i will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth
 and whenever i make a cloud come over the earth the bow will be seen in the cloud
 and i will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh
 and the bow will be in the cloud and looking on it i will keep in mind the eternal agreement between god and every living thing on the earth
 and god said to noah this is the sign of the agreement which i have made between me and all flesh on the earth
 and the sons of noah who went out of the ark were shem ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan
 these three were the sons of noah and from them all the earth was peopled
 in those days noah became a farmer and he made a vine garden
 and he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink and he was uncovered in his tent
 and ham the father of canaan saw his father unclothed and gave news of it to his two brothers outside
 and shem and japheth took a robe and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed
 and awaking from his wine noah saw what his youngest son had done to him and he said
 cursed be canaan let him be a servant of servants to his brothers
 and he said praise to the lord the god of shem let canaan be his servant
 may god make japheth great and let his living place be in the tents of shem and let canaan be his servant
 and noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters
 all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty and he came to his end
 the word which habakkuk the prophet saw
 how long o lord will your ears be shut to my voice i make an outcry to you about violent behaviour but you do not send salvation
 why do you make me see evil doing and why are my eyes fixed on wrong for wasting and violent acts are before me and there is fighting and bitter argument
 for this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected for the upright man is circled round by evil doers because of which right is twisted
 see among the nations and take note and be full of wonder for in your days i am doing a work in which you will have no belief even if news of it is given to you
 for see i am sending the chaldaeans that bitter and quick moving nation who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves living places which are not theirs
 they are greatly to be feared their right comes from themselves
 and their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves they come from far away like an eagle in flight rushing on its food
 they are coming all of them with force the direction of their faces is forward the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea
 he makes little of kings rulers are a sport to him all the strong places are to be laughed at for he makes earthworks and takes them
 then his purpose will be changed over stepping the limit he will make his strength his god
 are you not eternal o lord my god my holy one for you there is no death o lord he has been ordered by you for our punishment and by you o rock he has been marked out to put us right
 before your holy eyes sin may not be seen and you are unable to put up with wrong why then are your eyes on the false why do you say nothing when the evil doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself
 he has made men like the fishes of the sea like the worms which have no ruler over them
 he takes them all up with his hook he takes them in his net getting them together in his fishing net for which cause he is glad and full of joy
 for this reason he makes an offering to his net burning perfume to his fishing net because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat
 for this cause his net is ever open and there is no end to his destruction of the nations
 i will take my position and be on watch placing myself on my tower looking out to see what he will say to me and what answer he will give to my protest
 and the lord gave me an answer and said put the vision in writing and make it clear on stones so that the reader may go quickly
 for the vision is still for the fixed time and it is moving quickly to the end and it will not be false even if it is slow in coming go on waiting for it because it will certainly come it will not be kept back
 as for the man of pride my soul has no pleasure in him but the upright man will have life through his good faith
 a curse on the cruel and false one  the man full of pride who never has enough who makes his desires wide as the underworld  he is like death he is never full but he makes all nations come to him getting all peoples together to himself
 will not all these take up a word of shame against him and a bitter saying against him and say a curse on him who goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of debtors 
 will not your creditors suddenly be moved against you and your troublers get up from their sleep and you will be to them like goods taken in war
 because you have taken their goods from great nations all the rest of the peoples will take your goods from you because of mens blood and violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it
 a curse on him who gets evil profits for his family so that he may put his resting place on high and be safe from the hand of the wrongdoer 
 you have been a cause of shame to your house by cutting off a number of peoples and sinning against your soul
 for the stone will give a cry out of the wall and it will be answered by the board out of the woodwork
 a curse on him who is building a place with blood and basing a town on evil doing 
 see is it not the pleasure of the lord of armies that the peoples are working for the fire and using themselves up for nothing
 for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the sea is covered by the waters
 a curse on him who gives his neighbour the wine of his wrath making him overcome with strong drink from the cup of his passion so that you may be a witness of their shame 
 you are full of shame in place of glory take your part in the drinking and let your shame be uncovered the cup of the lords right hand will come round to you and your glory will be covered with shame
 for the violent acts against lebanon will come on you and the destruction of the cattle will be a cause of fear to you because of mens blood and the violent acts against the land and the town and all who are living in it
 what profit is the pictured image to its maker and as for the metal image the false teacher why does its maker put his faith in it making false gods without a voice
 a curse on him who says to the wood awake  to the unbreathing stone up  let it be a teacher  see it is plated with gold and silver and there is no breath at all inside it
 but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth be quiet before him
 a prayer of habakkuk the prophet put to shigionoth
 o lord word of you has come to my ears i have seen your work o lord when the years come near make it clear in wrath keep mercy in mind
 god came from teman and the holy one from mount paran selah the heavens were covered with his glory and the earth was full of his praise
 he was shining like the light he had rays coming out from his hand there his power was kept secret
 before him went disease and flames went out at his feet
 from his high place he sent shaking on the earth he saw and nations were suddenly moved and the eternal mountains were broken the unchanging hills were bent down his ways are eternal
 the curtains of cushan were troubled and the tents of midian were shaking
 was your wrath burning against the rivers were you angry with the sea that you went on your horses on your war carriages of salvation
 your bow was quite uncovered selah by you the earth was cut through with rivers
 the mountains saw you and were moved with fear the clouds were streaming with water the voice of the deep was sounding the sun did not come up and the moon kept still in her place
 at the light of your arrows they went away at the shining of your polished spear
 you went stepping through the land in wrath crushing the nations in your passion
 you went out for the salvation of your people for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put wounding the head of the family of the evil doer uncovering the base even to the neck selah
 you have put your spears through his head his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems they had joy in driving away the poor in making a meal of them secretly
 the feet of your horses were on the sea on the mass of great waters
 hearing it my inner parts were moved and my lips were shaking at the sound my bones became feeble and my steps were uncertain under me i gave sounds of grief in the day of trouble when his forces came up against the people in bands
 for though the fig tree has no flowers and there is no fruit on the vine and work on the olive comes to nothing and the fields give no food and the flock is cut off from its resting place and there is no herd in the cattle house
 still i will be glad in the lord my joy will be in the god of my salvation
 the lord god is my strength and he makes my feet like roes feet guiding me on my high places for the chief music maker on corded instruments
 in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month on the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel ruler of judah and to joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest saying
 these are the words of the lord of armies these people say the time has not come for building the lords house
 then the word of the lord came by haggai the prophet saying
 is it a time for you to be living in roofed houses while this house is a waste
 for this cause the lord of armies has said give thought to your ways
 much has been planted but little got in you take food but have not enough you take drink but are not full you are clothed but no one is warm and he who gets payment for his work gets it to put it into a bag full of holes
 this is what the lord of armies has said give thought to your ways
 go up to the hills and get wood and put up the house and i will take pleasure in it and be honoured says the lord
 you were looking for much and it came to little and when you got it into your house i took it away with a breath why says the lord of armies because of my house which is a waste while every man takes care of the house which is his
 for this cause the heaven over you is kept from giving dew and the earth from giving her fruit
 and by my order no rain came on the land or on the mountains or the grain or the wine or the oil or the produce of the earth or on men or cattle or on any work of mans hands
 then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest and all the rest of the people gave ear to the voice of the lord their god and to the words of haggai the prophet because the lord their god had sent him and the people were in fear before the lord
 then haggai whom the lord had sent to give his words to the people said i am with you says the lord
 and the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel ruler of judah was moved by the lord as was the spirit of joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of all the rest of the people and they came and did work in the house of the lord of armies their god
 on the twenty fourth day of the month in the sixth month in the second year of darius the king
 in the seventh month on the twenty first day of the month the word of the lord came by haggai the prophet saying
 say now to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel ruler of judah and to joshua the son of jehozadak the high priest and to the rest of the people
 who is there still among you who saw this house in its first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes as nothing
 but now be strong o zerubbabel says the lord and be strong o joshua son of jehozadak the high priest and be strong all you people of the land says the lord and get to work for i am with you says the lord of armies
 the agreement which i made with you when you came out of egypt and my spirit are with you still have no fear
 for this is what the lord of armies has said in a short time i will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land
 and i will make a shaking of all the nations and the desired things of all nations will come and i will make this house full of my glory says the lord of armies
 the silver is mine and the gold is mine says the lord of armies
 the second glory of this house will be greater than the first says the lord of armies and in this place i will give peace says the lord of armies
 on the twenty fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of darius the word of the lord came by haggai the prophet saying
 these are the words of the lord of armies put now a point of law to the priests saying
 if anyone has some holy flesh folded in the skirt of his robe will bread or soup or wine or oil or any other food be made holy if touched by his skirt and the priests answering said no
 then haggai said will any of these be made unclean by the touch of one who is unclean through touching a dead body and the priests answering said it will be made unclean
 then haggai said so is this people and so is this nation before me says the lord and so is every work of their hands and the offering they give there is unclean
 and now give thought looking back from this day to the time before one stone was put on another in the temple of the lord
 how when anyone came to a store of twenty measures there were only ten when anyone went to the wine store to get fifty vessels full there were only twenty
 and i sent burning and wasting and a rain of ice drops on all the works of your hands but still you were not turned to me says the lord
 and now give thought looking on from this day from the twenty fourth day of the ninth month from the time when the base of the lords house was put in its place give thought to it
 is the seed still in the store house have the vine and the fig tree the pomegranate and the olive tree still not given their fruit from this day i will send my blessing on you
 and the word of the lord came a second time to haggai on the twenty fourth day of the month saying
 say to zerubbabel ruler of judah i will make a shaking of the heavens and the earth
 overturning the power of kingdoms and i will send destruction on the strength of the kingdoms of the nations by me war carriages will be overturned with those who are in them and the horses and the horsemen will come down everyone by the sword of his brother
 in that day says the lord of armies i will take you o zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel says the lord and will make you as a jewelled ring for i have taken you to be mine says the lord of armies
 the word of the lord which came to hosea the son of beeri in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel
 the start of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea go take for yourself a wife of loose ways and children of the same for the land has been untrue to the lord
 so he took as his wife gomer the daughter of diblaim and she gave birth to a son
 and the lord said to him give him the name of jezreel for after a little time i will send punishment for the blood of jezreel on the line of jehu and put an end to the kingdom of israel
 and in that day i will let the bow of israel be broken in the valley of jezreel
 and after that she gave birth to a daughter and the lord said give her the name lo ruhamah for i will not again have mercy on israel to give them forgiveness
 but i will have mercy on judah and will give them salvation by the lord their god but not by the bow or the sword or by fighting or by horses or horsemen
 now when lo ruhamah had been taken from the breast the woman gave birth to a son
 and the lord said give him the name lo ammi for you are not my people and i will not be your god
 but still the number of the children of israel will be like the sand of the sea which may not be measured or numbered and in place of its being said to them you are not my people it will be said to them you are the sons of the living god
 and the children of israel and the children of judah will come together and take for themselves one head and will go up from the land for great will be the day of jezreel
 israel is a branching vine full of fruit as his fruit is increased so the number of his altars is increased as the land is fair so they have made fair pillars
 their mind is taken away now they will be made waste he will have their altars broken down he will give their pillars to destruction
 now truly they will say we have no king we have no fear of the lord and the king what is he able to do for us
 their words are foolish they make agreements with false oaths so punishment will come up like a poison plant in a ploughed field
 the people of samaria will be full of fear because of the ox of beth aven its people will have sorrow for it and its priests will give cries of grief for its glory for the glory has gone in flight
 and they will take it to assyria and give it to the great king shame will come on ephraim and israel will be shamed because of its image
 as for samaria her king is cut off like mist on the water
 and the high places of aven the sin of israel will come to destruction thorns and waste plants will come up on their altars they will say to the mountains be a cover over us and to the hills come down on us
 o israel you have done evil from the days of gibeah there they took up their position so that the fighting against the children of evil might not overtake them in gibeah
 i will come and give them punishment and the peoples will come together against them when i give them the reward of their two sins
 and ephraim is a trained cow taking pleasure in crushing the grain but i have put a yoke on her fair neck i will put a horseman on the back of ephraim judah will be working the plough jacob will be turning up the earth
 put in the seed of righteousness get in your grain in mercy let your unploughed earth be turned up for it is time to make search for the lord till he comes and sends righteousness on you like rain
 you have been ploughing sin you have got in a store of evil the fruit of deceit has been your food for you put faith in your way in the number of your men of war
 so a great outcry will go up from among your people and all your strong places will be broken as beth arbel was broken by shalman in the day of war as the mother was broken on the rocks with her children
 so will beth el do to you because of your evil doing at dawn will the king of israel be cut off completely
 when israel was a child he was dear to me and i took my son out of egypt
 when i sent for them then they went away from me they made offerings to the baals burning perfumes to images
 but i was guiding ephraims footsteps i took them up in my arms but they were not conscious that i was ready to make them well
 i made them come after me with the cords of a man with the bands of love i was to them as one who took the yoke from off their mouths putting meat before them
 he will go back to the land of egypt and the assyrian will be his king because they would not come back to me
 and the sword will go through his towns wasting his children and causing destruction because of their evil designs
 my people are given up to sinning against me though their voice goes up on high no one will be lifting them up
 how may i give you up o ephraim how may i be your saviour o israel how may i make you like admah how may i do to you as i did to zeboim my heart is turned in me it is soft with pity
 i will not put into effect the heat of my wrath i will not again send destruction on ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one among you i will not put an end to you
 they will go after the lord his cry will be like that of a lion his cry will be loud and the children will come from the west shaking with fear
 shaking with fear like a bird they will come out of egypt like a dove out of the land of assyria and i will give them rest in their houses says the lord
 the deceit of ephraim and the false words of israel are about me on every side 
 ephraims food is the wind and he goes after the east wind deceit and destruction are increasing day by day they make an agreement with assyria and take oil into egypt
 the lord has a cause against judah and will give punishment to jacob for his ways he will give him the reward of his acts
 in the body of his mother he took his brother by the foot and in his strength he was fighting with god
 he had a fight with the angel and overcame him he made request for grace to him with weeping he came face to face with him in beth el and there his words came to him
 even the lord the god of armies the lord is his name
 so then come back to your god keep mercy and right and be waiting at all times on your god
 as for canaan the scales of deceit are in his hands he takes pleasure in twisted ways
 and ephraim said now i have got wealth and much property in all my works no sin may be seen in me
 but i am the lord your god from the land of egypt i will give you tents for your living places again as in the days of the holy meeting
 my word came to the ears of the prophets and i gave them visions in great number and by the mouths of the prophets i made use of comparisons
 in gilead there is evil they are quite without value in gilgal they make offerings of oxen truly their altars are like masses of stones in the hollows of a ploughed field
 and jacob went in flight into the field of aram and israel became a servant for a wife and for a wife he kept sheep
 and by a prophet the lord made israel come up out of egypt and by a prophet he was kept safe
 i have been bitterly moved to wrath by ephraim so that his blood will be on him and the lord will make his shame come back on him
 when the words of my law came from ephraim he was lifted up in israel but when he did evil through the baal death overtook him
 and now their sins are increased they have made themselves a metal image false gods from their silver after their designs all of them the work of the metal workers they say of them let them give offerings let men give kisses to the oxen
 so they will be like the morning cloud like the dew which goes early away like the dust of the grain which the wind is driving out of the crushing floor like smoke going up from the fireplace
 but i am the lord your god from the land of egypt you have knowledge of no other god and there is no saviour but me
 i had knowledge of you in the waste land where no water was
 when i gave them food they were full and their hearts were full of pride and they did not keep me in mind
 so i will be like a lion to them as a cruel beast i will keep watch by the road
 i will come face to face with them like a bear whose young ones have been taken from her and their inmost hearts will be broken there the dogs will make a meal of them they will be wounded by the beasts of the field
 i have sent destruction on you o israel who will be your helper
 where is your king that he may be your saviour and all your rulers that they may take up your cause of whom you said give me a king and rulers
 i have given you a king because i was angry and have taken him away in my wrath
 the wrongdoing of ephraim is shut up his sin is put away in secret
 the pains of a woman in childbirth will come on him he is an unwise son for at this time it is not right for him to keep his place when children come to birth
 i will give the price to make them free from the power of the underworld i will be their saviour from death o death  where are your pains o underworld  where is your destruction my eyes will have no pity
 though he gives fruit among his brothers an east wind will come the wind of the lord coming up from the waste land and his spring will become dry his fountain will be without water it will make waste the store of all the vessels of his desire
 samaria will be made waste for she has gone against her god they will be cut down by the sword their little children will be broken on the rocks their women who are with child will be cut open
 o israel come back to the lord your god for your evil doing has been the cause of your fall
 take with you words and come back to the lord say to him let there be forgiveness for all wrongdoing so that we may take what is good and give in payment the fruit of our lips
 assyria will not be our salvation we will not go on horses we will not again say to the work of our hands you are our gods for in you there is mercy for the child who has no father
 i will put right their errors freely will my love be given to them for my wrath is turned away from him
 i will be as the dew to israel he will put out flowers like a lily and send out his roots like lebanon
 his branches will be stretched out he will be beautiful as the olive tree and sweet smelling as lebanon
 they will come back and have rest in his shade their life will be made new like the grain and they will put out flowers like the vine his name will be like the wine of lebanon
 as for ephraim what has he to do with false gods any longer i have given an answer and i will keep watch over him i am like a branching fir tree from me comes your fruit
 he who is wise will see these things he who has good sense will have knowledge of them for the ways of the lord are straight and the upright will go in them but sinners will be falling in them
 say to your brothers ammi and to your sisters ruhamah
 take up the cause against your mother take it up for she is not my wife and i am not her husband let her put away her loose ways from her face and her false ways from between her breasts
 for fear that i may take away her robe from her making her uncovered as in the day of her birth making her like a waste place and a dry land causing her death through need of water
 and i will have no mercy on her children for they are the children of her loose ways
 for their mother has been untrue she who gave them birth has done things of shame for she said i will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water my wool and my linen my oil and my wine
 for this cause i will put thorns in her road building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way
 and if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them if she makes search for them she will not see them then will she say i will go back to my first husband for then it was better for me than now
 for she had no knowledge that it was i who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the baal
 so i will take away again my grain in its time and my wine and i will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered
 and now i will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers and no one will take her out of my hand
 and i will put an end to all her joy her feasts her new moons and her sabbaths and all her regular meetings
 and i will make waste her vines and her fig trees of which she has said these are the payments which my lovers have made to me and i will make them a waste of trees and the beasts of the field will take them for food
 and i will give her punishment for the days of the baals to whom she has been burning perfumes when she made herself fair with her nose rings and her jewels and went after her lovers giving no thought to me says the lord
 for this cause i will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her
 and i will give her vine gardens from there and the valley of achor for a door of hope and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young and as in the time when she came up out of the land of egypt
 and in that day says the lord you will say to me ishi and you will never again give me the name of baali
 for i will take away the names of the baals out of her mouth and never again will she say their names
 and in that day i will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth i will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land and will make them take their rest in peace
 and i will take you as my bride for ever truly i will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging in love and in mercies
 i will take you as my bride in good faith and you will have knowledge of the lord
 and it will be in that day says the lord that i will give an answer to the heavens and the heavens to the earth
 and the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil and they will give an answer to jezreel
 and i will put her as seed in the earth and i will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given and i will say to those who were not my people you are my people and they will say my god
 and the lord said to me give your love again to a woman who has a lover and is false to her husband even as the lord has love for the children of israel though they are turned to other gods and are lovers of grape cakes
 so i got her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a half of barley
 and i said to her you are to be mine for a long space of time you are not to be false to me and no other man is to have you for his wife and so will i be to you
 for the children of israel will for a long time be without king and without ruler without offerings and without pillars and without ephod or images
 and after that the children of israel will come back and go in search of the lord their god and david their king and they will come in fear to the lord and to his mercies in the days to come
 give ear to the word of the lord o children of israel for the lord has a cause against the people of this land because there is no good faith in it and no mercy and no knowledge of god in the land
 there is cursing and broken faith violent death and attacks on property men are untrue in married life houses are broken into and there is blood touching blood
 because of this the land will be dry and everyone living in it will be wasted away with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven even the fishes of the sea will be taken away
 let no man go to law or make protests for your people are like those who go to law with a priest
 you will not be able to keep on your feet by day and by night the prophet will be falling down with you and i will give your mother to destruction
 destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge because you have given up knowledge i will give you up so that you will be no priest to me because you have not kept in mind the law of your god i will not keep your children in my memory
 even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me i will let their glory be changed into shame
 the sin of my people is like food to them and their desire is for their wrongdoing
 and the priest will be like the people i will give them punishment for their evil ways and the reward of their acts
 they will have food but they will not be full they will be false to me but they will not be increased because they no longer give thought to the lord
 loose ways and new wine take away wisdom
 my people get knowledge from their tree and their rod gives them news for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering and they have been false to their god
 they make offerings on the tops of mountains burning perfumes in high places under trees of every sort because their shade is good and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands
 i will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour for they make themselves separate with loose women and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods the people who have no wisdom will be sent away
 do not you o israel come into error do not you o judah come to gilgal or go up to beth aven or take an oath by the living lord
 for israel is uncontrolled like a cow which may not be controlled now will the lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place
 ephraim is joined to false gods let him be
 their drink has become bitter they are completely false her rulers take pleasure in shame
 they are folded in the skirts of the wind they will be shamed because of their offerings
 give ear to this o priests give attention o israel and you family of the king for you are to be judged you have been a deceit at mizpah and a net stretched out on tabor
 they have gone deep in the evil ways of shittim but i am the judge of all
 i have knowledge of ephraim and israel is not secret from me for now o ephraim you have been false to me israel has become unclean
 their works will not let them come back to their god for a false spirit is in them and they have no knowledge of the lord
 and the pride of israel gives an answer to his face and ephraim will have a fall through his sins and the fall of judah will be the same as theirs
 they will go with their flocks and their herds in search of the lord but they will not see him he has taken himself out of their view
 they have been false to the lord they have given birth to strange children now the new moon will make them waste with their fields
 let the horn be sounded in gibeah and in ramah give a loud cry in beth aven they are after you o benjamin
 ephraim will become a waste in the day of punishment i have given knowledge among the tribes of israel of what is certain
 the rulers of judah are like those who take away a landmark i will let loose my wrath on them like flowing water
 ephraim is troubled he is crushed by his judges because he took pleasure in walking after deceit
 and so to ephraim i am like a wasting insect and a destruction to the children of judah
 when ephraim saw his disease and judah his wound then ephraim went to assyria and sent to the great king but he is not able to make you well or give you help for your wound
 for i will be to ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the children of judah i even i will give him wounds and go away i will take him away and there will be no helper
 i will go back to my place till they are made waste in their trouble they will go after me early and will make search for me
 come let us go back to the lord for he has given us wounds and he will make us well he has given blows and he will give help
 after two days he will give us life and on the third day he will make us get up and we will be living before him
 and let us have knowledge let us go after the knowledge of the lord his going out is certain as the dawn his decisions go out like the light he will come to us like the rain like the spring rain watering the earth
 o ephraim what am i to do to you o judah what am i to do to you for your love is like a morning cloud and like the dew which goes early away
 so i have had it cut in stones i gave them teaching by the words of my mouth
 because my desire is for mercy and not offerings for the knowledge of god more than for burned offerings
 but like a man they have gone against the agreement there they were false to me
 gilead is a town of evil doers marked with blood
 and like a band of thieves waiting for a man so are the priests watching secretly the way of those going quickly to shechem for they are working with an evil design
 in israel i have seen a very evil thing there false ways are seen in ephraim israel is unclean
 and judah has put up disgusting images for himself
 when my desire was for the fate of my people to be changed and to make israel well then the sin of ephraim was made clear and the evil doing of samaria for their ways are false and the thief comes into the house while the band of outlaws takes property by force in the streets
 and they do not say to themselves that i keep in mind all their sin now their evil acts come round them on every side they are before my face
 in their sin they make a king for themselves and rulers in their deceit
 they are all untrue they are like a burning oven the bread maker does not make up the fire from the time when the paste is mixed till it is leavened
 on the day of our king the rulers made him ill with the heat of wine his hand was stretched out with the men of pride
 for they have made their hearts ready like an oven while they are waiting secretly their wrath is sleeping all night in the morning it is burning like a flaming fire
 they are all heated like an oven and they put an end to their judges all their kings have been made low not one among them makes prayer to me
 ephraim is mixed with the peoples ephraim is a cake not turned
 men from other lands have made waste his strength and he is not conscious of it grey hairs have come on him here and there and he has no knowledge of it
 and the pride of israel gives an answer to his face but for all this they have not gone back to the lord their god or made search for him
 and ephraim is like a foolish dove without wisdom they send out their cry to egypt they go to assyria
 when they go my net will be stretched out over them i will take them like the birds of heaven i will give them punishment i will take them away in the net for their sin
 may trouble be theirs  for they have gone far away from me and destruction for they have been sinning against me i was ready to be their saviour but they said false words against me
 and they have not made prayer to me in their hearts but they make loud cries on their beds they are cutting themselves for food and wine they are turned against me
 though i have given training and strength to their arms they have evil designs against me
 they have gone to what is of no value they are like a false bow their captains will come to destruction by the sword and their ruler by my wrath for this the land of egypt will make sport of them
 put the horn to your mouth he comes like an eagle against the house of the lord because they have gone against my agreement they have not kept my law
 they will send up to me a cry for help we israel have knowledge of you o god of israel
 israel has given up what is good his haters will go after him
 they have put up kings but not by me they have made princes but i had no knowledge of it they have made images of silver and gold so that they may be cut off
 i will have nothing to do with your young ox o samaria my wrath is burning against them how long will it be before the children of israel make themselves clean
 the workman made it it is no god the ox of samaria will be broken into bits
 for they have been planting the wind and their fruit will be the storm his grain has no stem it will give no meal and if it does a strange nation will take it
 israel has come to destruction now they are among the nations like a cup in which there is no pleasure
 for they have gone up to assyria like an ass going by himself ephraim has given money to get lovers
 but though they give money to the nations for help still i will send them in all directions and in a short time they will be without a king and rulers
 because ephraim has been increasing altars for sin altars have become a cause of sin to him
 though i put my law in writing for him in ten thousand rules they are to him as a strange thing
 he gives the offerings of his lovers and takes the flesh for food but the lord has no pleasure in them now he will keep in mind their evil doing and give them the punishment of their sins they will go back to egypt
 for israel has no memory of his maker and has put up the houses of kings and judah has made great the number of his walled towns but i will send a fire on his towns and put an end to his great houses
 have no joy o israel and do not be glad like the nations for you have been untrue to your god your desire has been for the loose womans reward on every grain floor
 the grain floor and the place where the grapes are crushed will not give them food there will be no new wine for them
 they will have no resting place in the lords land but ephraim will go back to egypt and they will take unclean food in assyria
 they will give no wine offering to the lord they will not make offerings ready for him their bread will be like the bread of those in sorrow all who take it will be unclean because their bread will be only for their desire it will not come into the house of the lord
 what will you do on the day of worship and on the day of the feast of the lord
 for see they are going away into assyria egypt will get them together memphis will be their last resting place their fair silver vessels will be covered over with field plants and thorns will come up in their tents
 the days of punishment the days of reward are come israel will be put to shame the prophet is foolish the man who has the spirit is off his head because of your great sin
 there is great hate against the watchman of ephraim the people of my god as for the prophet there is a net in all his ways and hate in the house of his god
 they have gone deep in evil as in the days of gibeah he will keep in mind their wrongdoing he will give them punishment for their sins
 i made discovery of israel as of grapes in the waste land i saw your fathers as the first fruits of the fig tree in her early fruit time but they came to baal peor and made themselves holy to the thing of shame and became disgusting like that to which they gave their love
 as for ephraim their glory will go in flight like a bird there will be no birth and no one with child and no giving of life
 even though their children have come to growth i will take them away so that not a man will be there for their evil doing will be complete and they will be put to shame because of it
 as i have seen a beast whose young have been taken from her so ephraim will give birth to children only for them to be put to death
 o lord what will you give them give them bodies which may not give birth and breasts without milk
 all their evil doing is in gilgal there i had hate for them because of their evil doing i will send them out of my house they will no longer be dear to me all their rulers are uncontrolled
 the rod has come on ephraim their root is dry let them have no fruit even though they give birth i will put to death the dearest fruit of their bodies
 my god will give them up because they did not give ear to him they will be wandering among the nations
 the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw about judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah
 give ear o heavens and you o earth to the word which the lord has said i have taken care of my children till they became men but their hearts have been turned away from me
 even the ox has knowledge of its owner and the ass of the place where its master puts its food but israel has no knowledge my people give no thought to me
 o nation full of sin a people weighted down with crime a generation of evil doers false hearted children they have gone away from the lord they have no respect for the holy one of israel their hearts are turned back from him
 why will you have more and more punishment why keep on in your evil ways every head is tired and every heart is feeble
 the body from head to foot is all diseased it is a mass of open wounds marks of blows and broken flesh the flow of blood has not been stopped and no oil has been put on the wounds
 your country has become waste your towns are burned with fire as for your land it is overturned before your eyes made waste and overcome by men from strange lands
 and the daughter of zion has become like a tent in a vine garden like a watchmans house in a field of fruit like a town shut in by armies
 if the lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe we would have been like sodom and the fate of gomorrah would have been ours
 give ear to the word of the lord you rulers of sodom let your hearts be turned to the law of our god you people of gomorrah
 what use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me says the lord your burned offerings of sheep and the best parts of fat cattle are a weariness to me i take no pleasure in the blood of oxen or of lambs or of he goats
 at whose request do you come before me making my house unclean with your feet
 give me no more false offerings the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me so are your new moons and sabbaths and your holy meetings
 your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul they are a weight in my spirit i am crushed under them
 and when your hands are stretched out to me my eyes will be turned away from you even though you go on making prayers i will not give ear your hands are full of blood
 be washed make yourselves clean put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes let there be an end of sinning
 take pleasure in well doing let your ways be upright keep down the cruel give a right decision for the child who has no father see to the cause of the widow
 come now and let us have an argument together says the lord how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow how may their dark purple seem like wool
 if you will give ear to my word and do it the good things of the land will be yours
 but if your hearts are turned against me i will send destruction on you by the sword so the lord has said
 the upright town has become untrue there was a time when her judges gave right decisions when righteousness had a resting place in her but now she is full of those who take mens lives
 your silver is no longer true metal your wine is mixed with water
 your chiefs have gone against the lord they have become friends of thieves every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father and they do not let the cause of the widow come before them
 for this reason the lord the lord of armies the strong one of israel has said i will put an end to my haters and send punishment on those who are against me
 and my hand will again be on you washing away what is unclean as with soap and taking away all your false metal
 and i will give you judges again as at the first and wise guides as in the past then you will be named the town of righteousness the true town
 upright acts will be the price of zions forgiveness and by righteousness will men be living there
 but a common destruction will overtake sinners and evil doers together and those who have gone away from the lord will be cut off
 for you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire and because of the gardens of your pleasure
 for you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry and like a garden without water
 and the strong will be as food for the fire and his work as a flame and they will be burned together with no one to put out the fire
 cursed are those who make evil decisions and the writers who make the records of their cruel acts
 who do wrong to the poor in their cause and take away the right of the crushed among my people so that they may have the property of widows and get under their power those who have no father
 and what will you do in the day of punishment and in the destruction which is coming from far to whom will you go for help and what will become of your glory
  for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
 ho  assyrian the rod of my wrath the instrument of my punishment 
 i will send him against a nation of wrongdoers and against the people of my wrath i will give him orders to take their wealth in war crushing them down like the dust in the streets
 but this is not what is in his mind and this is not his design but his purpose is destruction and the cutting off of more and more nations
 for he says are not all my captains kings
 will not the fate of calno be like that of carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus
 as my hand has come on the kingdoms of the images whose pictured images were more in number than those of jerusalem and samaria
 so as i have done to samaria and her images i will do to jerusalem and her images
 for this cause it will be that when the purpose of the lord against mount zion and jerusalem is complete i will send punishment on the pride of the heart of the king of assyria and on the glory of his uplifted eyes
 for he has said by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my knowledge for i am wise and i have taken away the limits of the peoples lands and the stores of their wealth have become mine and i have made towns low in the dust sending destruction on those living in them
 and i have put my hands on the wealth of the peoples as on the place where a bird has put her eggs and as a man may take the eggs from which a bird has gone so i have taken all the earth for myself and not a wing was moved and not a mouth gave out a sound
 will the axe say high sounding words against him who is using it or the blade be full of pride against him who is cutting with it as if a rod had the power of shaking him who is using it or as if a stick might take up him who is not wood
 for this cause the lord the lord of armies will make his fat become wasted and in his inner parts a fire will be lighted like a burning flame
 and the light of israel will be for a fire and his holy one for a flame wasting and burning up his thorns in one day
 and he will put an end to the glory of his woods and of his planted fields soul and body together and it will be as when a man is wasted by disease
 and the rest of the trees of his wood will be small in number so that a child may put them down in writing
 and it will be in that day that the rest of israel and those of jacob who have come safely through these troubles will no longer go for help to him whose rod was on their back but their faith will be in the lord the holy one of israel
 the rest even the rest of jacob will come back to the strong god
 for though your people o israel are as the sand of the sea only a small number will come back for the destruction is fixed overflowing in righteousness
 for the lord the lord of armies is about to make destruction complete in all the land
 for this cause the lord the lord of armies says o my people living in zion have no fear of the assyrian even if his rod comes on your back and his stick is lifted up as in egypt
 for in a very short time my passion will be over and my wrath will be turned to their destruction
 and the lord of armies will be shaking a whip against him as when he overcame midian at the rock of oreb and his rod will be lifted up against them as it was against the egyptians
 and in that day the weight which he put on your back will be taken away and his yoke broken from off your neck
 he has gone up from pene rimmon he has come to aiath he has gone past migron at michmash he puts his forces in order
 they have gone across the mountain geba will be our resting place tonight they say ramah is shaking with fear gibeah of saul has gone in flight
 give a loud cry daughter of gallim let laishah give ear let anathoth give answer to her
 madmenah has gone the men of gebim are putting their goods in a safe place
 this very day he is stopping at nob he is shaking his hand against the mountain of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem
 see the lord the lord of armies is cutting off his branches with a great noise and his strong ones are falling and his high ones are coming down
 and he is cutting down the thick places of the wood with an axe and lebanon with its tall trees is coming down
 and there will come a rod out of the broken tree of jesse and a branch out of his roots will give fruit
 and the spirit of the lord will be resting on him the spirit of wisdom and good sense the spirit of wise guiding and strength the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord
 and he will not be guided in his judging by what he sees or give decisions by the hearing of his ears
 but he will do right in the cause of the poor and give wise decisions for those in the land who are in need and the rod of his mouth will come down on the cruel and with the breath of his lips he will put an end to the evil doer
 and righteousness will be the cord of his robe and good faith the band round his breast
 and the wolf will be living with the lamb and the leopard will take his rest with the young goat and the lion will take grass for food like the ox and the young lion will go with the young ones of the herd and a little child will be their guide
 and the cow and the bear will be friends while their young ones are sleeping together
 and the child at the breast will be playing by the hole of the snake and the older child will put his hand on the bright eye of the poison snake
 there will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the lord as the sea is covered by the waters
 and in that day the eyes of the nations will be turned to the root of jesse which will be lifted up as the flag of the peoples and his resting place will be glory
 and in that day the hand of the lord will be stretched out the second time to get back the rest of his people from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the sea lands
 and he will put up a flag as a sign to the nations and he will get together those of israel who had been sent away and the wandering ones of judah from the four ends of the earth
 and the envy of ephraim will be gone and those who make trouble for judah will come to an end ephraim will have no more envy of judah and there will be an end of judahs hate for ephraim
 and they will be united in attacking the philistines on the west and together they will take the goods of the children of the east their hand will be on edom and moab and the children of ammon will be under their rule
 and the lord will make the tongue of the egyptian sea completely dry and with his burning wind his hand will be stretched out over the river and it will be parted into seven streams so that men may go over it with dry feet
 and there will be a highway for the rest of his people from assyria as there was for israel in the day when he came up out of the land of egypt
 and in that day you will say i will give praise to you o lord for though you were angry with me your wrath is turned away and i am comforted
 see god is my salvation i will have faith in the lord without fear for the lord jah is my strength and song and he has become my salvation
 so with joy will you get water out of the springs of salvation
 and in that day you will say give praise to the lord let his name be honoured give word of his doings among the peoples say that his name is lifted up
 make a song to the lord for he has done noble things give news of them through all the earth
 let your voice be sounding in a cry of joy o daughter of zion for great is the holy one of israel among you
 the word of the lord about babylon which isaiah the son of amoz saw
 put up a flag on a clear mountain top make a loud outcry to them give directions with the hand so that they may go into the doors of the great ones
 i have given orders to my holy ones i have sent out my men of war those of mine who take pride in their power to give effect to my wrath
 the noise of great numbers in the mountains like the noise of a strong people  the noise of the kingdoms of the nations meeting together  the lord of armies is numbering his forces for war
 they come from a far country from the farthest part of heaven even the lord and the instruments of his wrath with destruction for all the land
 send out a cry of grief for the day of the lord is near it comes as destruction from the most high
 for this cause all hands will be feeble and every heart of man be turned to water
 their hearts will be full of fear pains and sorrows will overcome them they will be in pain like a woman in childbirth they will be shocked at one another their faces will be like flames
 see the day of the lord is coming cruel with wrath and burning passion to make the land a waste driving the sinners in it to destruction
 for the stars of heaven and its bright armies will not give their light the sun will be made dark in his journey through the heaven and the moon will keep back her light
 and i will send punishment on the world for its evil and on the sinners for their wrongdoing and i will put an end to all pride and will make low the power of the cruel
 i will make men so small in number that a man will be harder to get than gold even the best gold of ophir
 for this cause the heavens will be shaking and the earth will be moved out of its place in the wrath of the lord of armies and in the day of his burning passion
 and it will be that like a roe in flight and like wandering sheep they will go every man to his people and to his land
 everyone who is overtaken will have a spear put through him and everyone who goes in flight will be put to the sword
 their young children will be broken up before their eyes their goods will be taken away and their wives made the property of others
 see i am driving the medes against them who put no value on silver and have no pleasure in gold
 in their hands are bows and spears they are cruel violently putting the young men to death and crushing the young women they have no pity for children and no mercy for the fruit of the body
 and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beautiful town which is the pride of the chaldaeans will be like gods destruction of sodom and gomorrah
 people will never be living in it again and it will have no more men from generation to generation the arab will not put up his tent there and those who keep sheep will not make it a resting place for their flocks
 but the beasts of the waste land will have their holes there and the houses will be full of crying jackals and ostriches will have their place there and evil spirits will be dancing there
 and wolves will be answering one another in their towers and jackals in their houses of pleasure her time is near and her days of power will quickly be ended
 for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will again make israel his special people and will put them in their land and the man from a strange country will take his place among them and be joined to the family of jacob
 and the people will take them with them to their place and the children of israel will give them a heritage in the lords land as men servants and women servants making them prisoners whose prisoners they were and they will be rulers over their masters
 and it will be in the day when the lord gives you rest from your sorrow and from your trouble and from the hard yoke which they had put on you
 that you will take up this bitter song against the king of babylon and say how has the cruel overseer come to an end  he who was lifted up in pride is cut off
 the stick of the evil doers the rod of the rulers is broken by the lord
 he whose rod was on the peoples with an unending wrath ruling the nations in passion with an uncontrolled rule
 all the earth is at rest and is quiet they are bursting into song
 even the trees of the wood are glad over you the trees of lebanon saying from the time of your fall no wood cutter has come up against us with an axe
 the underworld is moved at your coming the shades of the dead are awake before you even the strong ones of the earth all the kings of the world have got up from their seats
 they all make answer and say to you have you become feeble like us have you been made even as we are
 your pride has gone down into the underworld and the noise of your instruments of music the worms are under you and your body is covered with them
 how great is your fall from heaven o shining one son of the morning  how are you cut down to the earth low among the dead bodies 
 for you said in your heart i will go up to heaven i will make my seat higher than the stars of god i will take my place on the mountain of the meeting place of the gods in the inmost parts of the north
 i will go higher than the clouds i will be like the most high
 but you will come down to the underworld even to its inmost parts
 those who see you will be looking on you with care they will be in deep thought saying is this the troubler of the earth the shaker of kingdoms
 who made the world a waste overturning its towns who did not let his prisoners loose from the prison house
 all the kings of the earth are at rest in glory every man in his house
 but you like a birth before its time are stretched out with no resting place in the earth clothed with the bodies of the dead who have been put to the sword who go down to the lowest parts of the underworld a dead body crushed under foot
 as for your fathers you will not be united with them in their resting place because you have been the cause of destruction to your land and of death to your people the seed of the evil doer will have no place in the memory of man
 make ready a place of death for his children because of the evil doing of their father so that they may not come up and take the earth for their heritage covering the face of the world with waste places
 for i will come up against them says the lord of armies cutting off from babylon name and offspring son and sons son says the lord
 and i will make you a heritage for the hedgehog and pools of water and i will go through it with the brush of destruction says the lord of armies
 the lord has taken an oath saying my design will certainly come about and my purpose will be effected
 to let the assyrian be broken in my land and crushed under foot on my mountains there will his yoke be taken away from them and his rule over them come to an end
 this is the purpose for all the earth and this is the hand stretched out over all nations
 for it is the purpose of the lord of armies and who will make it of no effect when his hand is stretched out by whom may it be turned back
 in the year of the death of king ahaz this word came to the prophet
 be not glad o philistia all of you because the rod which was on you is broken for out of the snakes root will come a poison snake and its fruit will be a winged poison snake
 and the poorest of the land will have food and those in need will be given a safe resting place but your seed will come to an end for need of food and the rest of you will be put to the sword
 send out a cry o door  make sounds of sorrow o town  all your land has come to nothing o philistia for there comes a smoke out of the north and everyone keeps his place in the line
 what answer then will my people give to the representatives of the nation that the lord is the builder of zion and she will be a safe place for the poor of his people
 the word about moab for in a night ar of moab has become waste and is seen no longer for in a night kir of moab has become waste and is seen no longer
 the daughter of dibon has gone up to the high places weeping moab is sounding her cry of sorrow over nebo and over medeba everywhere the hair of the head and of the face is cut off
 in their streets they are covering themselves with haircloth on the tops of their houses and in their public places there is crying and bitter weeping
 heshbon is crying out and elealeh their voice is sounding even to jahaz for this cause the heart of moab is shaking his soul is shaking with fear
 my heart is crying out for moab her people go in flight to zoar and to eglath shelishiyah for they go up with weeping by the slope of luhith on the way to horonaim they send up a cry of destruction
 the waters of nimrim will become dry for the grass is burned up the young grass is coming to an end every green thing is dead
 for this cause they will take away their wealth and the stores they have got together over the stream of the water plants
 for the cry has gone round the limits of moab as far as to eglaim and beer elim
 for the waters of dimon are full of blood and im sending even more on moab a lion on those of moab who go in flight and on the rest of the land
 and they will send  to the mountain of the daughter of zion
 for the daughters of moab will be like wandering birds like a place from which the young birds have gone in flight at the ways across the arnon
 give wise directions make a decision let your shade be as night in full day keep safe those who are in flight do not give up the wandering ones
 let those who have been forced out of moab have a resting place with you be a cover to them from him who is making waste their land till the cruel ones are cut off and wasting has come to an end and those who take pleasure in crushing the poor are gone from the land
 then a kings seat will be based on mercy and one will be seated on it in the tent of david for ever judging uprightly and quick to do righteousness
 we have had word of the pride of moab how great it is how he is lifted up in pride and passion his high words about himself are false
 for this cause everyone in moab will give cries of grief for moab crushed to the earth they will be weeping for the men of kir hareseth
 for the fields of heshbon are waste the vine of sibmah is dead the lords of nations were overcome by the produce of her vines her vine plants went as far as jazer and came even to the waste land her branches were stretched out to the sea
 for this cause my sorrow for the vine of sibmah will be like the weeping for jazer my eyes are dropping water on you o heshbon and elealeh  for they are sounding the war cry over your summer fruits and the getting in of your grain
 and all joy is gone no longer are they glad for the fertile field and in the vine gardens there are no songs or sounds of joy the crushing of grapes has come to an end and its glad cry has been stopped
 for this cause the cords of my heart are sounding for moab and i am full of sorrow for kir heres
 and when moab goes up to the high place and makes prayer in the house of his god it will have no effect
 this is the word which the lord said about moab in the past
 but now the lord has said in three years the years of a servant working for payment the glory of moab all that great people will be turned to shame and the rest of moab will be very small and without honour
 the word about damascus see they have made damascus a town no longer it has become a waste place
 her towns are unpeopled for ever there the flocks take their rest in peace without fear
 the strong tower has gone from ephraim and the kingdom from damascus the rest of aram will come to destruction and be made like the glory of the children of israel says the lord of armies
 and it will be in that day that the glory of jacob will be made small and the strength of his body will become feeble
 and it will be like a man cutting the growth of his grain pulling together the heads of the grain with his arm even as when they get in the grain in the valley of rephaim
 but it will be like a man shaking an olive tree something will still be there two or three berries on the top of the highest branch four or five on the outside branches of a fertile tree says the lord the god of israel
 in that day a mans heart will be turned to his maker and his eyes to the holy one of israel
 he will not be looking to the altars the work of his hands or to the wood pillars or to the sun images which his fingers have made
 in that day your towns will be like the waste places of the hivites and the amorites which the children of israel took for a heritage and they will come to destruction
 for you have not given honour to the god of your salvation and have not kept in mind the rock of your strength for this cause you made a garden of adonis and put in it the vine cuttings of a strange god
 in the day of your planting you were watching its growth and in the morning your seed was flowering but its fruit is wasted away in the day of grief and bitter sorrow
 ah  the voice of peoples like the loud sounding of the seas and the thundering of great nations rushing on like the bursting out of waters 
 but he will put a stop to them and make them go in flight far away driving them like the waste of the grain on the tops of the mountains before the wind and like the circling dust before the storm
 in the evening there is fear and in the morning they are gone this is the fate of those who take our goods and the reward of those who violently take our property for themselves
 ho  land of the sounding of wings on the other side of the rivers of ethiopia
 which sends its representatives by the sea even in ships of papyrus on the waters go back quickly o representatives to a nation tall and smooth to a people causing fear through all their history a strong nation crushing down its haters whose land is cut through by rivers
 all you peoples of the world and you who are living on the earth when a flag is lifted up on the mountains give attention and when the horn is sounded give ear
 for this is what the lord has said to me i will be quiet watching from my place like the clear heat when the sun is shining like a mist of dew in the heat of summer
 for before the time of getting in the grapes after the opening of the bud when the flower has become a grape ready for crushing he will take away the small branches with knives cutting down and taking away the wide stretching branches
 they will be for the birds of the mountains and for the beasts of the earth the birds will come down on them in the summer and the beasts of the earth in the winter
 in that time an offering will be made to the lord of armies from a people tall and smooth causing fear through all their history a strong nation crushing down its haters whose land is cut through by rivers an offering taken to the place of the name of the lord of armies even mount zion
 the word about egypt see the lord is seated on a quick moving cloud and is coming to egypt and the false gods of egypt will be troubled at his coming and the heart of egypt will be turned to water
 and i will send the egyptians against the egyptians and they will be fighting every one against his brother and every one against his neighbour town against town and kingdom against kingdom
 and the spirit of egypt will be troubled in her and i will make her decisions without effect and they will be turning to the false gods and to those who make hollow sounds and to those who have control of spirits and to those who are wise in secret arts
 and i will give the egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord and a hard king will be their ruler says the lord the lord of armies
 and the waters of the sea will be cut off and the river will become dry and waste
 and the rivers will have an evil smell the stream of egypt will become small and dry all the water plants will come to nothing
 the grass lands by the nile and everything planted by the nile will become dry or taken away by the wind and will come to an end
 the fishermen will be sad and all those who put fishing lines into the nile will be full of grief and those whose nets are stretched out on the waters will have sorrow in their hearts
 and all the workers in linen thread and those who make cotton cloth will be put to shame
 and the makers of twisted thread will be crushed and those who  will be sad in heart
 the chiefs of zoan are completely foolish the wisest guides of pharaoh have become like beasts how do you say to pharaoh i am the son of the wise the offspring of early kings
 where then are your wise men let them make clear to you let them give you knowledge of the purpose of the lord of armies for egypt
 the chiefs of zoan have become foolish the chiefs of noph are tricked the heads of her tribes are the cause of egypts wandering out of the way
 the lord has sent among them a spirit of error and by them egypt is turned out of the right way in all her doings as a man overcome by wine is uncertain in his steps
 and in egypt there will be no work for any man head or tail high or low to do
 in that day the egyptians will be like women and the land will be shaking with fear because of the waving of the lords hand stretched out over it
 and the land of judah will become a cause of great fear to egypt whenever its name comes to mind egypt will be in fear before the lord of armies because of his purpose against it
 in that day there will be five towns in the land of egypt using the language of canaan and making oaths to the lord of armies and one of them will be named the town of the sun
 in that day there will be an altar to the lord in the middle of the land of egypt and a pillar to the lord at the edge of the land
 and it will be a sign and a witness to the lord of armies in the land of egypt when they are crying out to the lord because of their cruel masters then he will send them a saviour and a strong one to make them free
 and the lord will give the knowledge of himself to egypt and the egyptians will give honour to the lord in that day they will give him worship with offerings and meal offerings and will take an oath to the lord and give effect to it
 and the lord will send punishment on egypt and will make them well again and when they come back to the lord he will give ear to their prayer and take away their disease
 in that day there will be a highway out of egypt to assyria and assyria will come into egypt and egypt will come into assyria and the egyptians will give worship to the lord together with the assyrians
 in that day israel will be the third together with egypt and assyria a blessing in the earth
 because of the blessing of the lord of armies which he has given them saying a blessing on egypt my people and on assyria the work of my hands and on israel my heritage
 the word which isaiah the son of amoz saw about judah and jerusalem
 and it will come about in the last days that the mountain of the lord will be placed on the top of the mountains and be lifted up over the hills and all nations will come to it
 and the peoples will say come and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will give us knowledge of his ways and we will be guided by his word for out of zion the law will go out and the word of the lord from jerusalem
 and he will be the judge between the nations and the peoples will be ruled by his decisions and their swords will be turned into plough blades and their spears into vine knives no longer will the nations be turning their swords against one another and the knowledge of war will be gone for ever
 o family of jacob come and let us go in the light of the lord
 for you o lord have given up your people the family of jacob because they are full of the evil ways of the east and make use of secret arts like the philistines and are friends with the children of strange countries
 and their land is full of silver and gold and there is no end to their stores their land is full of horses and there is no end to their carriages
 their land is full of images they give worship to the work of their hands even to that which their fingers have made
 and the poor mans head is bent and the great man goes down on his face for this cause there will be no forgiveness for their sin
 go into a hole in the rock covering yourselves with dust in fear of the lord before the glory of his power
 the high looks of man will be put to shame and the pride of men will be made low and only the lord will be lifted up in that day
 for the day of the lord of armies is coming on all the pride of men and on all who are high and lifted up
 and on all the high trees of lebanon and on all the strong trees of bashan
 and on all the high mountains and on all the hills which are lifted up
 and on every high tower and on every strong wall
 and on all the ships of tarshish and on all the fair boats
 and the high looks of man will be put to shame and the pride of men will be made low and only the lord will be lifted up in that day
 and the images will never be seen again
 and men will go into cracks of the rocks and into holes of the earth for fear of the lord and before the glory of his power when he comes out of his place shaking the earth with his strength
 in that day men will put their images of silver and of gold which they made for worship in the keeping of the beasts of the dark places
 to take cover in the cracks of the rocks and in the holes of the hills for fear of the lord and before the glory of his power when he comes out of his place shaking the earth with his strength
 have no more to do with man whose life is only a breath for he is of no value
 in the year when the tartan came to ashdod sent by sargon king of assyria and made war against it and took it
 at that time the word of the lord came to isaiah the son of amoz saying go and take off your robe and your shoes from your feet and he did so walking unclothed and without shoes on his feet
 and the lord said as my servant isaiah has gone unclothed and without shoes for three years as a sign and a wonder to egypt and ethiopia
 so will the king of assyria take away the prisoners of egypt and those forced out of ethiopia young and old unclothed and without shoes and with backs uncovered to the shame of egypt
 and they will be full of fear and will no longer have faith in ethiopia which was their hope or in egypt which was their glory
 and those living by the sea will say in that day see the fate of our hope to whom we went for help and salvation from the king of assyria what hope have we then of salvation
 the word about the waste land as storm winds in the south go rushing through it comes from the waste land from the land greatly to be feared
 a vision of fear comes before my eyes the worker of deceit goes on in his false way and the waster goes on making waste up  elam to the attack  media i have put an end to her sorrow
 for this cause i am full of bitter grief pains like the pains of a woman in childbirth have come on me i am bent down with sorrow at what comes to my ears i am shocked by what i see
 my mind is wandering fear has overcome me the evening of my desire has been turned into shaking for me
 they make ready the table they put down the covers they take food and drink up  you captains put oil on your breastplates
 for so has the lord said to me go let a watchman be placed let him give word of what he sees
 and when he sees war carriages horsemen by twos war carriages with asses war carriages with camels let him give special attention
 and the watchman gave a loud cry o my lord i am on the watchtower all day and am placed in my watch every night
 see here come war carriages with men horsemen by twos and in answer he said babylon is made low is made low and all her images are broken on the earth
 o my crushed ones the grain of my floor  i have given you the word which came to me from the lord of armies the god of israel
 the word about edom a voice comes to me from seir watchman how far gone is the night how far gone is the night
 the watchman says the morning has come but night is still to come if you have questions to put put them and come back again
 the word about arabia in the thick woods of arabia will be your nights resting place o travelling bands of dedanites 
 give water to him who is in need of water give bread o men of the land of tema to those in flight
 for they are in flight from the sharp sword and the bent bow and from the trouble of war
 for so has the lord said to me in a year by the years of a servant working for payment all the glory of kedar will come to an end
 and the rest of the bowmen the men of war of the children of kedar will be small in number for the lord the god of israel has said it
 the word about the valley of vision why have all your people gone up to the house tops
 you who are full of loud voices a town of outcries given up to joy your dead men have not been put to the sword or come to their death in war
 all your rulers  have gone in flight all your strong ones have gone far away
 for this cause i have said let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping i will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people
 for it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the lord the lord of armies in the valley of vision 
 and elam was armed with arrows and aram came on horseback and the breastplate of kir was uncovered
 and your most fertile valleys were full of war carriages and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town
 he took away the cover of judah and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods
 and you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of david and you got together the waters of the lower pool
 and you had the houses of jerusalem numbered pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger
 and you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool but you gave no thought to him who had done this and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before
 and in that day the lord the lord of armies was looking for weeping and cries of sorrow cutting off of the hair and putting on the clothing of grief
 but in place of these there was joy and delight oxen and sheep were being made ready for food there was feasting and drinking men said now is the time for food and wine for tomorrow death comes
 and the lord of armies said to me secretly truly this sin will not be taken from you till your death says the lord the lord of armies
 the lord the lord of armies says go to this person in authority this shebna who is over the house who has made himself a resting place on high cutting out a place for himself in the rock and say
 who are you and by what right have you made for yourself a resting place here
 see o strong man the lord will send you violently away gripping you with force
 twisting you round and round like a ball he will send you out into a wide country there you will come to your end and there will be the carriages of your pride o shame of your lords house 
 and i will have you forced out of your place of authority and pulled down from your position
 and in that day i will send for my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah
 and i will put your robe on him and put your band about him and i will give your authority into his hand and he will be a father to the men of jerusalem and to the family of judah
 and i will give the key of the family of david into his care and what he keeps open will be shut by no one and what he keeps shut no one will make open
 and i will put him like a nail in a safe place and he will be for a seat of glory to his fathers family
 and all the glory of his fathers family will be hanging on him all their offspring every small vessel even the cups and the basins
 in that day says the lord of armies will the nail fixed in a safe place give way and it will be cut down and in its fall the weight hanging on it will be cut off for the lord has said it
 the word about tyre let a cry of sorrow go up o ships of tarshish because your strong place is made waste on the way back from the land of kittim the news is given to them
 send out a cry of grief you men of the sea land traders of zidon who go over the sea whose representatives are on great waters
 who get in the seed of shihor whose wealth is the trade of the nations
 be shamed o zidon for the sea the strong place of the sea has said i have not been with child or given birth i have not taken care of young men or kept watch over the growth of virgins
 when the news comes to egypt they will be bitterly pained at the fate of tyre
 go over to tarshish give cries of sorrow o men of the sea land
 is this the town which was full of joy whose start goes back to times long past whose wanderings took her into far off countries
 by whom was this purposed against tyre the crowning town whose traders are chiefs whose business men are honoured in the land
 it was the purpose of the lord of armies to put pride to shame to make sport of the glory of those who are honoured in the earth
 let your land be worked with the plough o daughter of tarshish there is no longer any harbour
 his hand is stretched out over the sea the kingdoms are shaking the lord has given orders about canaan to make waste its strong places
 and he said there is no more joy for you o crushed virgin daughter of zidon up  go over to kittim even there you will have no rest
 
 let a cry of sorrow go up o ships of tarshish because your strong place is made waste
 and it will be in that day that tyre will go out of mind for seventy years that is the days of one king after the end of seventy years it will be for tyre as in the song of the loose woman
 take an instrument of music go about the town o loose woman who has gone out from the memory of man make sweet melody with songs so that you may come back to mens minds
 and it will be after the end of seventy years that the lord will have mercy on tyre and she will go back to her trade acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth
 and her goods and her trade will be holy to the lord they will not be kept back or stored up for her produce will be for those living in the lords land to give them food for their needs and fair clothing
 see the lord is making the earth waste and unpeopled he is turning it upside down and sending the people in all directions
 and it will be the same for the people as for the priest for the servant as for his master and for the woman servant as for her owner the same for the one offering goods for a price as for him who takes them the same for him who gives money at interest and for him who takes it the same for him who lets others have the use of his property as for those who make use of it
 the earth will be completely waste and without men for this is the word of the lord
 the earth is sorrowing and wasting away the world is full of grief and wasting away the high ones of the earth come to nothing
 the earth has been made unclean by those living in it because the laws have not been kept by them the orders have been changed and the eternal agreement has been broken
 for this cause the earth is given up to the curse and those in it are judged as sinners for this cause those living on the earth are burned up and the rest are small in number
 the new wine is thin the vine is feeble and all the glad hearted make sounds of grief
 the pleasing sound of all instruments of music has come to an end and the voices of those who are glad
 there is no more drinking of wine with a song strong drink will be bitter to those who take it
 the town is waste and broken down every house is shut up so that no man may come in
 there is a crying in the streets because of the wine there is an end of all delight the joy of the land is gone
 in the town all is waste and in the public place is destruction
 for it will be in the heart of the earth among the peoples like the shaking of an olive tree as the last of the grapes after the getting in is done
 but those will be making sounds of joy they will be crying loudly from the sea for the glory of the lord
 give praise to the lord in the east to the name of the lord the god of israel in the sea lands
 from the farthest part of the earth comes the sound of songs glory to the upright but i said i am wasting away wasting away the curse is on me  the false ones go on in their false way yes they go on acting falsely
 fear and death and the net are come on you o people of the earth
 and it will be that he who goes in flight from the sound of fear will be overtaken by death and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net for the windows on high are open and the bases of the earth are shaking
 the earth is completely broken it is parted in two it is violently moved
 the earth will be moving uncertainly like a man overcome by drink it will be shaking like a tent and the weight of its sin will be on it crushing it down so that it will not get up again
 and in that day the lord will send punishment on the army of the high ones on high and on the kings of the earth on the earth
 and they will be got together like prisoners in the prison house and after a long time they will have their punishment
 then the moon will be veiled and the sun put to shame for the lord of armies will be ruling in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his judges he will let his glory be seen
 o lord you are my god i will give praise to you i will give honour to your name for you have done great acts of power your purposes in the past have been made true and certain in effect
 for you have made a town a waste place a strong town a mass of broken walls the tower of the men of pride has come to an end it will never be put up again
 for this cause will the strong people give glory to you the town of the cruel ones will be in fear of you
 for you have been a strong place for the poor and the crushed in their trouble a safe place from the storm a shade from the heat when the wrath of the cruel ones is like a winter storm
 as heat by the shade of a cloud the noise of the men of pride has been made quiet by you as heat by the shade of a cloud the song of the cruel ones has been stopped
 and in this mountain will the lord of armies make for all peoples a feast of good things a feast of wines long stored of good things sweet to the taste of wines long kept and tested
 and in this mountain he will put an end to the shade covering the face of all peoples and the veil which is stretched over all nations
 he has put an end to death for ever and the lord god will take away all weeping and he will put an end to the shame of his people in all the earth for the lord has said it
 and in that day it will be said see this is our god we have been waiting for him and he will be our saviour this is the lord in whom is our hope we will be glad and have delight in his salvation
 for in this mountain will the hand of the lord come to rest and moab will be crushed down in his place even as the dry stems of the grain are crushed under foot in the waste place
 and if he puts out his hands like a man stretching out his hands in swimming the lord will make low his pride however expert his designs
 and the strong tower of your walls has been broken by him made low and crushed even to the dust
 in that day will this song be made in the land of judah we have a strong town he will make salvation our walls and towers
 let the doors be open so that the upright nation which keeps faith may come in
 the man whose heart is unmoved you will keep in peace because his hope is in you
 let your hope be in the lord for ever for the lord jah is an unchanging rock
 for he has made low those who are lifted up all the people of the town of pride he makes it low crushing it down to the earth he makes it low in the dust
 it will be crushed under the feet of the poor and the steps of those who are in need
 the way of the good man is straight the road of the upright is made smooth by you
 we have been waiting for you o lord the desire of our soul is for the memory of your name
 in the night the desire of my soul has been for you early will my spirit be searching for you for when your punishments come on the earth the people of the world will get the knowledge of righteousness
 even if you are kind to the evil doer he will not go after righteousness even in the land of the upright he will still go on in his wrongdoing and will not see the glory of the lord
 lord your hand is lifted up but they do not see let them see  yes your haters will be burned up in the fire
 lord you will give us peace for all our works are the outcome of your purpose
 o lord our god other lords than you have had rule over us but in you only is our salvation and no other name will we take on our lips
 the dead will not come back to life their spirits will not come back to earth for this cause you have sent destruction on them so that the memory of them is dead
 you have made the nation great o lord you have made it great glory is yours you have made wide the limits of the land
 lord in trouble our eyes have been turned to you we sent up a prayer when your punishment was on us
 as a woman with child whose time is near is troubled crying out in her pain so have we been before you o lord
 we have been with child we have been in pain we have given birth to wind no salvation has come to the earth through us and no children have come into the world
 your dead will come back their dead bodies will come to life again those in the dust awaking from their sleep will send out a song for your dew is a dew of light and the earth will give birth to the shades
 come my people into your secret places and let your doors be shut keep yourself safe for a short time till his wrath is over
 for the lord is coming out of his place to send punishment on the people of the earth for their evil doing the earth will let the blood drained out on her be seen and will keep her dead covered no longer
 in that day the lord with his great and strong and cruel sword will send punishment on leviathan the quick moving snake and on leviathan the twisted snake and he will put to death the dragon which is in the sea
 in that day it will be said a vine garden of delight make a song about it
 i the lord am watching it i will give it water at all times i will keep it night and day for fear that any damage comes to it
 my passion is over if the thorns were fighting against me i would make an attack on them and they would be burned up together
 or let him put himself under my power and make peace with me
 in days to come jacob will take root israel will put out buds and flowers and the face of the world will be full of fruit
 is his punishment like the punishment of those who overcame him or are his dead as great in number as those he put to the sword
 your anger against her has been made clear by driving her away he has taken her away with his storm wind in the day of his east wind
 so by this will the sin of jacob be covered and this is all the fruit of taking away his punishment when all the stones of the altar are crushed together so that the wood pillars and the sun images will not be put up again
 for the strong town is without men an unpeopled living place and she has become a waste land there the young ox will take his rest and its branches will be food for him
 when its branches are dry they will be broken off the women will come and put fire to them for it is a foolish people for this cause he who made them will have no mercy on them and he whose work they are will not have pity on them
 and it will be in that day that the lord will get together his grain from the river to the stream of egypt and you will be got together with care o children of israel
 and it will be in that day that a great horn will be sounded and those who were wandering in the land of assyria and those who had been sent away into the land of egypt will come and they will give worship to the lord in the holy mountain at jerusalem
 ho  crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in ephraim and the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of those who are overcome by strong drink 
 see the lord has a strong and cruel one like a rain of ice a storm of destruction like the overflowing of a strong river he will violently overcome them
 the crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in ephraim will be crushed under foot
 and the dead flower of his glory which is on the head of the fertile valley will be like the first early fruit before the summer which a man takes and puts in his mouth the minute he sees it
 in that day will the lord of armies be a crown of glory and a fair ornament to the rest of his people
 and a spirit of wisdom to the judge and strength to those who keep back the attackers at the door of the town
 and further these are uncertain through wine and have gone out of the right way through strong drink the priest and the prophet are uncertain through strong drink they are overcome by wine they have gone out of the way through strong drink their vision is false they go wrong in their decisions
 for all the tables are covered with coughed up food so that there is not a clean place
 to whom will he give knowledge and to whom will he make clear the word will it be to those who have newly given up milk and who have only now been taken from the breast
 for it is one rule after another one line after another here a little there a little
 no but with broken talk and with a strange tongue he will give his word to this people
 to whom he said this is the rest give rest to him who is tired and by this you may get new strength but they would not give ear
 for this cause the word of the lord will be to them rule after rule line after line here a little there a little so that they may go on their way and falling back may be broken and taken in the net
 give ear then to the word of the lord you men of pride the rulers of this people in jerusalem
 because you have said we have made death our friend and with the underworld we have made an agreement when the overflowing waters come through they will not come near us for we are looking to false words for help taking cover in what is untrue
 for this cause says the lord god see i am placing in zion as a base a stone a tested stone an angle stone which is certain and of great value and he who has faith will not give way
 and i will make right decision the measuring line and righteousness the weight and the ice storm will take away the safe place of false words and the secret place will be covered by the flowing waters
 and the help you were looking for from death will come to nothing and your agreement with the underworld will be broken when the overflowing waters come through then you will be overcome by them
 whenever they come through they will overtake you for they will come through morning after morning by day and by night and the news will be nothing but fear
 for the bed is not long enough for a man to be stretched out on and the cover is not wide enough for him to be covered with
 for the lord will come up as on mount perazim he will be moved to wrath as in the valley of gibeon so that he may do his work  strange is his work and give effect to his act  unnatural is his act
 and now take care that you do not make sport of him or your bands will be made strong for i have had word from the lord the lord of armies of an end of a complete end which is to come on all the land
 let your ears be open to my voice give attention to what i say
 is the ploughman for ever ploughing does he not get the earth ready and broken up for the seed
 when the face of the earth has been levelled does he not put in the different sorts of seed and the grain in lines and the barley in its place and the spelt at the edge
 for his god is his teacher giving him the knowledge of these things
 for the fitches are not crushed with a sharp instrument and a cart wheel is not rolled over the cummin but the grain of the fitches is hammered out with a stick and of the cummin with a rod
 is the grain for bread crushed he does not go on crushing it for ever but he lets his cart wheels and his horses go over it without crushing it
 this comes from the lord of armies purposing wonders and wise in all his acts
 ho  ariel ariel the town against which david made war put year to year let the feasts come round
 and i will send trouble on ariel and there will be weeping and cries of grief and she will be to me as ariel
 and i will make war on you like david and you will be shut in by earthworks and i will make towers round you
 and you will be made low and your voice will come out of the earth and your words will be low out of the dust and your voice will come out of the earth like that of a spirit making bird like noises out of the dust
 and the army of your attackers will be like small dust and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind suddenly it will come about
 the lord of armies will come in with thunder and earth shaking and great noise with rushing wind and storm and the flame of burning fire
 and all the nations making war on ariel and all those who are fighting against her and shutting her in with their towers will be like a dream like a vision of the night
 and it will be like a man desiring food and dreaming that he is feasting but when he is awake there is nothing in his mouth or like a man in need of water dreaming that he is drinking but when he is awake he is feeble and his soul is full of desire so will all the nations be which make war on mount zion
 be surprised and full of wonder let your eyes be covered and be blind be overcome but not with wine go with uncertain steps but not because of strong drink
 for the lord has sent on you a spirit of deep sleep and by him your eyes the prophets are shut and your heads the seers are covered
 and the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book which is shut which men give to one who has knowledge of writing saying make clear to us what is in the book and he says i am not able to for the book is shut
 and they give it to one without learning saying make clear to us what is in the book and he says i have no knowledge of writing
 and the lord said because this people come near to me with their mouths and give honour to me with their lips but their heart is far from me and their fear of me is false a rule given them by the teaching of men
 for this cause i will again do a strange thing among this people a thing to be wondered at and the wisdom of their wise men will come to nothing and the sense of their guides will no longer be seen
 cursed are those who go deep to keep their designs secret from the lord and whose works are in the dark and who say who sees us and who has knowledge of our acts
 you are turning things upside down  is the wet earth the same to you as the one who is forming it will the thing made say of him who made it he made me not or the thing formed say of him who gave it form he has no knowledge
 in a very short time lebanon will become a fertile field and the fertile field will seem like a wood
 and in that day those whose ears are stopped will be hearing the words of the book and the eyes of the blind will see through the mist and the dark
 and the poor will have their joy in the lord increased and those in need will be glad in the holy one of israel
 for the cruel one has come to nothing and those who make sport of the lord are gone and those who are watching to do evil are cut off
 who give help to a man in a wrong cause and who put a net for the feet of him who gives decisions in the public place taking away a mans right without cause
 for this reason the lord the saviour of abraham says about the family of jacob jacob will not now be put to shame or his face be clouded with fear
 but when they the children of jacob see the work of my hands among them they will give honour to my name yes they will give honour to the holy one of jacob and go in fear of the god of israel
 those whose hearts were turned away from him will get knowledge and those who made an outcry against him will give attention to his teaching
 for the lord the lord of armies is about to take away from jerusalem and from judah all their support their store of bread and of water
 the strong man and the man of war the judge and the prophet the man who has knowledge of secret arts and the man who is wise because of his years
 the captain of fifty and the man of high position and the wise guide and the wonder worker and he who makes use of secret powers
 and i will make children their chiefs and foolish ones will have rule over them
 and the people will be crushed every one by his neighbour the young will be full of pride against the old and those of low position will be lifted up against the noble
 when one man puts his hand on another in his fathers house and says you have clothing be our ruler and be responsible for us in our sad condition
 then he will say with an oath i will not be a helper for in my house there is no bread or clothing i will not let you make me a ruler of the people
 for jerusalem has become feeble and destruction has come on judah because their words and their acts are against the lord moving the eyes of his glory to wrath
 their respect for a mans position is a witness against them and their sin is open to the view of all like that of sodom it is not covered a curse on their soul  for the measure of their sin is full
 happy is the upright man  for he will have joy of the fruit of his ways
 unhappy is the sinner  for the reward of his evil doings will come on him
 as for my people their ruler is acting like a child and those who have authority over them are women o my people your guides are the cause of your wandering turning your footsteps out of the right way
 the lord is ready to take up his cause against his people and is about to come forward as their judge
 the lord comes to be the judge of their responsible men and of their rulers it is you who have made waste the vine garden and in your houses is the property of the poor which you have taken by force
 by what right are you crushing my people and putting a bitter yoke on the necks of the poor this is the word of the lord the lord of armies
 again the lord has said because the daughters of zion are full of pride and go with outstretched necks and wandering eyes with their foot chains sounding when they go
 the lord will send disease on the heads of the daughters of zion and the lord will let their secret parts be seen
 in that day the lord will take away the glory of their foot rings and their sun jewels and their moon ornaments
 the ear rings and the chains and the delicate clothing
 the head bands and the arm chains and the worked bands and the perfume boxes and the jewels with secret powers
 the rings and the nose jewels
 the feast day dresses and the robes and the wide skirts and the handbags
 the looking glasses and the fair linen and the high head dresses and the veils
 and in the place of sweet spices will be an evil smell and for a fair band a thick cord for a well dressed head there will be the cutting off of the hair and for a beautiful robe there will be the clothing of sorrow the mark of the prisoner in place of the ornaments of the free
 your men will be put to the sword and your men of war will come to destruction in the fight
 and in the public places of her towns will be sorrow and weeping and she will be seated on the earth waste and uncovered
 ho  uncontrolled children says the lord who give effect to a purpose which is not mine and who make an agreement but not by my spirit increasing their sin
 who make a move to go down into egypt without authority from me who are looking to the strength of pharaoh for help and whose hope is in the shade of egypt
 and the strength of pharaoh will be your shame and your hope in the shade of egypt will come to nothing
 for his chiefs are at zoan and his representatives have come to hanes
 for they have all come with offerings to a people of no use to them in whom is no help or profit but only shame and a bad name
 the word about the beasts of the south through the land of trouble and grief the land of the she lion and the voice of the lion of the snake and the burning winged snake they take their wealth on the backs of young asses and their stores on camels to a people in whom is no profit
 for there is no use or purpose in the help of egypt so i have said about her she is rahab who has come to an end
 now go put it in writing before them on a board and make a record of it in a book so that it may be for the future a witness for all time to come
 for they are an uncontrolled people false hearted who will not give ear to the teaching of the lord
 who say to the seers see not and to the prophets do not give us word of what is true but say false things to give us pleasure
 get out of the good way turning from the right road do not keep the holy one of israel before our minds
 for this cause the holy one of israel says because you will not give ear to this word and are looking for help in ways of deceit and evil and are putting your hope in them
 this sin will be to you like a crack in a high wall causing its fall suddenly and in a minute
 and he will let it be broken as a potters vessel is broken it will be smashed to bits without mercy so that there will not be a bit in which one may take fire from the fireplace or water from the spring
 for the lord the holy one of israel said in quiet and rest is your salvation peace and hope are your strength but you would not have it so
 saying no for we will go in flight on horses so you will certainly go in flight and we will go on the backs of quick running beasts so those who go after you will be quick footed
 a thousand will go in fear before one even before five you will go in flight till you are like a pillar by itself on the top of a mountain and like a flag on a hill
 for this cause the lord will be waiting so that he may be kind to you and he will be lifted up so that he may have mercy on you for the lord is a god of righteousness there is a blessing on all whose hope is in him
 o people living in zion at jerusalem your weeping will be ended he will certainly have mercy on you at the sound of your cry when it comes to his ear he will give you an answer
 and though the lord will give you the bread of trouble and the water of grief you will no longer put your teacher on one side but you will see your teacher
 and at your back when you are turning to the right hand or to the left a voice will be sounding in your ears saying this is the way in which you are to go
 and you will make unclean what is covering your pictured images of silver and the plating of your images of gold you will send them away as an unclean thing saying be gone 
 and he will give rain for your seed so that you may put it in the earth and you will have bread from the produce of the earth good and more than enough for your needs in that day the cattle will get their food in wide grass lands
 and the oxen and the young asses which are used for ploughing will have salted grain which has been made free from the waste with fork and basket
 and there will be rivers and streams of water on every tall mountain and on every high hill in the day when great numbers are put to the sword when the towers come down
 and the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun will be seven times greater as the light of seven days in the day when the lord puts oil on the wounds of his people and makes them well from the blows they have undergone
 see the name of the lord is coming from far burning with his wrath with thick smoke going up his lips are full of passion and his tongue is like a burning fire
 and his breath is as an overflowing stream coming up even to the neck shaking the nations for their destruction like the shaking of grain in a basket and he will put a cord in the mouths of the people turning them out of their way
 you will have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept and you will be glad in heart as when they go with music of the pipe to the mountain of the lord the rock of israel
 and the lord will send out the sound of his great voice and they will see his arm stretched out with the heat of his wrath and the flame of a burning fire with a cloud burst and storm and a rain of ice
 for through the voice of the lord the assyrian will be broken and the lords rod will be lifted up against him
 and every blow of the rod of his punishment which the lord will send on him will be with the sound of music and with the waving of his sword the lord will make war against him
 for a place of fire has long been ready yes it has been made ready for the king he has made it deep and wide it is massed with fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of fire puts a light to it
 cursed are those who go down to egypt for help and who put their faith in horses looking to war carriages for salvation because of their numbers and to horsemen because they are very strong but they are not looking to the holy one of israel or turning their hearts to the lord
 though he is wise and able to send evil and his purpose will not be changed but he will go against the house of the evil doers and against those to whom they are looking for help
 for the egyptians are men and not god and their horses are flesh and not spirit and when the lords hand is stretched out the helper and he who is helped will come down together
 for the lord has said to me as a lion or a young lion makes an angry noise over his food and if a band of herdsmen come out against him he will not be in fear of their voices or give up his food for their noise so the lord of armies will come down to make war against mount zion and its hill
 like birds with outstretched wings so will the lord of armies be a cover to jerusalem he will be a cover and salvation for it going over it he will keep it from danger
 come back to him who has been so deeply sinned against by the children of israel
 for in that day they will all give up their images of silver and of gold the sin which they made for themselves
 then the assyrian will come down by the sword but not of man the sword not of men will be the cause of his destruction and he will go in flight from the sword and his young men will be put to forced work
 and his rock will come to nothing because of fear and his chiefs will go in flight from the flag says the lord whose fire is in zion and his altar in jerusalem
 see a king will be ruling in righteousness and chiefs will give right decisions
 and a man will be as a safe place from the wind and a cover from the storm as rivers of water in a dry place as the shade of a great rock in a waste land
 and the eyes of those who see will not be shut and those who have hearing will give ear to the word
 the man of sudden impulses will become wise in heart and he whose tongue is slow will get the power of talking clearly
 the foolish man will no longer be named noble and they will not say of the false man that he is a man of honour
 for the foolish man will say foolish things having evil thoughts in his heart working what is unclean and talking falsely about the lord to keep food from him who is in need of it and water from him whose soul is desiring it
 the designs of the false are evil purposing the destruction of the poor man by false words even when he is in the right
 but the noble hearted man has noble purposes and by these he will be guided
 give ear to my voice you women who are living in comfort give attention to my words you daughters who have no fear of danger
 in not much more than a year you who are not looking for evil will be troubled for the produce of the vine gardens will be cut off and there will be no getting in of the grapes
 be shaking with fear you women who are living in comfort be troubled you who have no fear of danger take off your robes and put on clothing of grief
 have sorrow for the fields the pleasing fields the fertile vine
 and for the land of my people where thorns will come up even for all the houses of joy in the glad town
 for the fair houses will have no man living in them the town which was full of noise will become a waste the hill and the watchtower will be unpeopled for ever a joy for the asses of the woods a place of food for the flocks
 till the spirit comes on us from on high and the waste land becomes a fertile field and the fertile field is changed into a wood
 then in the waste land there will be an upright rule and righteousness will have its place in the fertile field
 and the work of righteousness will be peace and the effect of an upright rule will be to take away fear for ever
 and my people will be living in peace in houses where there is no fear and in quiet resting places
 but the tall trees will come down with a great fall and the town will be low in a low place
 happy are you who are planting seed by all the waters and sending out the ox and the ass
 ho  you who make waste those who did not make you waste acting falsely to those who were not false to you when you have come to an end of wasting you will be made waste and after your false acts they will do the same to you
 o lord have mercy on us for we have been waiting for your help be our strength every morning our salvation in time of trouble
 at the loud noise the peoples have gone in flight at your coming up the nations have gone in all directions
 and the goods taken in war will be got together like the massing of young locusts men will be rushing on them like the rushing of locusts
 the lord is lifted up his place is on high he has made zion full of righteousness and true religion
 and she will have no more fear of change being full of salvation wisdom and knowledge the fear of the lord is her wealth
 see the men of war are sorrowing outside the town those who came looking for peace are weeping bitterly
 the highways are waste no man is journeying there the agreement is broken he has made sport of the towns he has no thought for man
 the earth is sorrowing and wasting away lebanon is put to shame and has become waste sharon is like the arabah and in bashan and carmel the leaves are falling
 now will i come forward says the lord now will i be lifted up now will my power be seen
 your designs will be without profit and their effect will be nothing you will be burned up by the fire of my breath
 and the peoples will be like the burning of chalk as thorns cut down which are burned in the fire
 give ear you who are far off to what i have done see my power you who are near
 the sinners in zion are full of fear the haters of god are shaking with wonder who among us may keep his place before the burning fire who among us may see the eternal burnings
 he whose ways are true and whose words are upright he who gives no thought to the profits of false acts whose hands have not taken rewards who will have no part in putting men to death and whose eyes are shut against evil
 he will have a place on high he will be safely shut in by the high rocks his bread will be given to him his waters will be certain
 your eyes will see the king in his glory they will be looking on a far stretching land
 your heart will give thought to the cause of your fear where is the scribe where is he who made a record of the payments where is he by whom the towers were numbered
 never again will you see the cruel people a people whose tongue has no sense for you whose language is strange to you
 let your eyes be resting on zion the town of our holy feasts you will see jerusalem a quiet resting place a tent which will not be moved whose tent pins will never be pulled up and whose cords will never be broken
 but there the lord will be with us in his glory  wide rivers and streams where no boat will go with blades and no fair ship will be sailing
 for the lord is our judge the lord is our law giver the lord is our king he will be our saviour
 your cords have become loose they were not able to make strong the support of their sails the sail was not stretched out then the blind will take much property the feeble footed will make division of the goods of war
 and the men of zion will not say i am ill for its people will have forgiveness for their sin
 come near you nations and give ear take note you peoples let the earth and everything in it give ear the world and all those living in it
 for the lord is angry with all the nations and his wrath is burning against all their armies he has put them to the curse he has given them to destruction
 their dead bodies will be thick on the face of the earth and their smell will come up and the mountains will be flowing with their blood and all the hills will come to nothing
 and the heavens will be rolled together like the roll of a book and all their army will be gone like a dead leaf from the vine or a dry fruit from the fig tree
 for my sword in heaven is full of wrath see it is coming down on edom in punishment on the people of my curse
 the sword of the lord is full of blood it is fat with the best of the meat with the blood of lambs and goats with the best parts of the sheep for the lord has a feast in bozrah and much cattle will be put to death in the land of edom
 and the strong oxen will go down to death together with the smaller cattle
 for it is the day of the lords punishment when he gives payment for the wrongs done to zion
 and its streams will be turned into boiling oil and its dust into burning stone and all the land will be on fire
 it will not be put out day or night its smoke will go up for ever it will be waste from generation to generation no one will go through it for ever
 but the birds of the waste land will have their place there it will be a heritage for the bittern and the raven and it will be measured out with line and weight as a waste land
 the jackals will be there and her great ones will be gone they will say there is no longer a kingdom there and all her chiefs will have come to an end
 and thorns will come up in her fair houses and waste plants in her strong towers and foxes will make their holes there and it will be a meeting place for ostriches
 and the beasts of the waste places will come together with the jackals and the evil spirits will be crying to one another even the night spirit will come and make her resting place there
 the arrowsnake will make her hole and put her eggs there and get her young together under her shade there the hawks will come together by twos
 see what is recorded in the book of the lord all these will be there not one without the other the mouth of the lord has given the order and his spirit has made them come together
 and he has given them their heritage and by his hand it has been measured out to them it will be theirs for ever their resting place from generation to generation
 the waste land and the dry places will be glad the lowland will have joy and be full of flowers
 it will be flowering like the rose it will be full of delight and songs the glory of lebanon will be given to it the pride of carmel and sharon they will see the glory of the lord the power of our god
 make strong the feeble hands give support to the shaking knees
 say to those who are full of fear be strong and take heart see your god will give punishment the reward of god will come he himself will come to be your saviour
 then the eyes of the blind will see and the ears which are stopped will be open
 then will the feeble footed be jumping like a roe and the voice which was stopped will be loud in song for in the waste land streams will be bursting out and waters in the dry places
 and the burning sand will become a pool and the dry earth springs of waters the fields where the sheep take their food will become wet land and water plants will take the place of grass
 and a highway will be there its name will be the holy way the unclean and the sinner may not go over it and those who go on it will not be turned out of the way by the foolish
 no lion will be there or any cruel beast they will not be seen there but those for whom the lord has given a price
 even those whom he has made free will come back again they will come with songs to zion on their heads will be eternal joy delight and joy will be theirs and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever
 and it came about in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the walled towns of judah and took them
 and the king of assyria sent the rab shakeh from lachish to jerusalem to king hezekiah with a strong force and he took up his position by the stream of the higher pool by the highway of the washermans
 and there came out to him eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder
 and the rab shakeh said to them say now to hezekiah these are the words of the great king the king of assyria in what are you placing your hope
 you say you have a design and strength for war but these are only words now to whom are you looking for support that you have gone against my authority
 see you are basing your hope on that broken rod of egypt which will go into a mans hand if he makes use of it for a support for so is pharaoh king of egypt to all who put their faith in him
 and if you say to me our hope is in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and altars hezekiah has taken away saying to judah and jerusalem that worship may only be given before this altar
 and now take a chance with my master the king of assyria and i will give you two thousand horses if you are able to put horsemen on them
 how then may you put to shame the least of my masters servants and you have put your hope in egypt for war carriages and horsemen
 and have i now come to send destruction on this land without the lords authority it was the lord himself who said to me go up against this land and make it waste
 then eliakim and shebna and joah said to the rab shakeh please make use of the aramaean language in talking to your servants for we are used to it and do not make use of the jews language in the hearing of the people on the wall
 but the rab shakeh said is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in
 then the rab shakeh got up and said with a loud voice in the jews language give ear to the words of the great king the king of assyria
 this is what the king says do not be tricked by hezekiah for there is no salvation for you in him
 and do not let hezekiah make you put your faith in the lord saying the lord will certainly keep us safe and this town will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 do not give ear to hezekiah for this is what the king of assyria says make peace with me and come out to me and everyone will be free to take the fruit of his vine and of his fig tree and the water of his spring
 till i come and take you away to a land like yours a land of grain and wine a land of bread and vine gardens
 give no attention to hezekiah when he says to you the lord will keep us safe has any one of the gods of the nations kept his land from falling into the hands of the king of assyria
 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim where are the gods of samaria and have they kept samaria out of my hand
 who among all the gods of these countries have kept their country from falling into my hand to give cause for the thought that the lord will keep jerusalem from falling into my hand
 but they kept quiet and gave him no answer for the kings order was give him no answer
 then eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder came to hezekiah with their clothing parted as a sign of grief and gave him an account of what the rab shakeh had said
 and on hearing it hezekiah took off his robe and put on haircloth and went into the house of the lord
 and he sent eliakim who was over the house and shebna the scribe and the chief priests dressed in haircloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
 and they said to him hezekiah says this day is a day of trouble and punishment and shame for the children are ready to come to birth but there is no strength to give birth to them
 it may be that the lord your god will give ear to the words of the rab shakeh whom the king of assyria his master has sent to say evil things against the living god and will make his words come to nothing so make your prayer for the rest of the people
 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
 and isaiah said to them this is what you are to say to your master the lord says be not troubled by the words which the servants of the king of assyria have said against me in your hearing
 see i will put a spirit into him and bad news will come to his ears and he will go back to his land and there i will have him put to death
 so the rab shakeh went back and when he got there the king of assyria was making war against libnah for it had come to his ears that the king of assyria had gone away from lachish
 and when news came to him that tirhakah king of ethiopia had made an attack on him  and he sent representatives to hezekiah king of judah saying
 this is what you are to say to hezekiah king of judah let not your god in whom is your faith give you a false hope saying jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of assyria
 no doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of assyria have done to all lands putting them to the curse and will you be kept safe from their fate
 did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden who were in telassar
 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the town of sepharvaim of hena and ivva
 and hezekiah took the letter from the hands of those who had come with it and after reading it hezekiah went up to the house of the lord opening the letter there before the lord
 and he made prayer to the lord saying
 o lord of armies the god of israel seated between the winged ones you only are the god of all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth
 let your ear be turned to us o lord let your eyes be open o lord and see take note of all the words of sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living god
 truly o lord the kings of assyria have made waste all the nations and their lands
 and have given their gods to the fire for they were no gods but wood and stone the work of mens hands so they have given them to destruction
 but now o lord our god give us salvation from his hand so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you and you only are the lord
 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying the lord the god of israel says the prayer you have made to me against sennacherib king of assyria has come to my ears
 this is the word which the lord has said about him in the eyes of the virgin daughter of zion you are shamed and laughed at the daughter of jerusalem has made sport of you
 against whom have you said evil and bitter things and against whom has your voice been loud and your eyes lifted up even against the holy one of israel
 you have sent your servants with evil words against the lord and have said with all my war carriages i have come up to the top of the mountains to the inmost parts of lebanon and its tall cedars will be cut down and the best trees of its woods i will come up into his highest places into his thick woods
 i have made water holes and taken their waters and with my foot i have made all the rivers of egypt dry
 has it not come to your ears how i did it long before purposing it in times long past now i have given effect to my design so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls
 this is why their townsmen had no power they were broken and put to shame they were like the grass of the field or a green plant like the grass on the house tops which a cold wind makes waste
 but i have knowledge of your getting up and your resting of your going out and your coming in
 because your wrath against me and your pride have come to my ears i will put my hook in your nose and my cord in your lips and i will make you go back by the way you came
 and this will be the sign to you you will get your food this year from what comes up of itself and in the second year from the produce of the same and in the third year you will put in your seed and get in the grain and make vine gardens and take of their fruit
 and those of judah who are still living will again take root in the earth and give fruit
 for from jerusalem those who have been kept safe will go out and those who are still living will go out of mount zion by the fixed purpose of the lord of armies this will be done
 for this cause the lord says about the king of assyria he will not come into this town or send an arrow against it he will not come before it with arms or put up an earthwork against it
 by the way he came he will go back and he will not get into this town
 for i will keep this town safe for my honour and for the honour of my servant david
 and the angel of the lord went out and put to death in the army of the assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand men and when the people got up early in the morning there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies
 sennacherib king of assyria went back to his place at nineveh
 and it came about when he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that his sons adrammelech and sharezer put him to death with the sword and they went in flight into the land of ararat and esar haddon his son became king in his place
 in those days hezekiah was ill and near death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said to him the lord says put your house in order for your death is near
 and hezekiah turning his face to the wall made his prayer to the lord saying
 o lord keep in mind how i have been true to you with all my heart and have done what is good in your eyes and hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping
 then the word of the lord came to isaiah saying
 go to hezekiah and say the lord the god of david your father says your prayer has come to my ears and i have seen your weeping see i will give you fifteen more years of life
 and i will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of assyria and i will keep watch over this town
 and isaiah said this is the sign the lord will give you that he will do what he has said
 see i will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of ahaz with the sun go back ten steps so the shade went back the ten steps by which it had gone down
 the writing of hezekiah king of judah after he had been ill and had got better from his disease
 i said in the quiet of my days i am going down into the underworld the rest of my years are being taken away from me
 i said i will not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i will not see man again or those living in the world
 my resting place is pulled up and taken away from me like a herdsmans tent my life is rolled up like a linen workers thread i am cut off from the cloth on the frame from day even to night you give me up to pain
 i am crying out with pain till the morning it is as if a lion was crushing all my bones
 i make cries like a bird i give out sounds of grief like a dove my eyes are looking up with desire o lord i am crushed take up my cause
 what am i to say seeing that it is he who has done it all my time of sleeping i am turning from side to side without rest
 o lord for this cause i am waiting for you give rest to my spirit make me well again and let me come back to life
 see in place of peace my soul had bitter sorrow but you have kept back my soul from the underworld for you have put all my sins out of your memory
 for the underworld is not able to give you praise death gives you no honour for those who go down into the underworld there is no hope in your mercy
 the living the living man he will give you praise as i do this day the father will give the story of your mercy to his children
 o lord quickly be my saviour so we will make my songs to corded instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the lord
 and isaiah said let them take a cake of figs and put it on the diseased place and he will get well
 and hezekiah said what is the sign that i will go up to the house of the lord
 at that time merodach baladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters with an offering to hezekiah because he had news that hezekiah had been ill and was well again
 and hezekiah was glad at their coming and let them see all his store of wealth the silver and the gold and the spices and the oil and all the house of his arms and everything there was in his stores there was nothing in all his house or his kingdom which he did not let them see
 then isaiah the prophet came to king hezekiah and said to him what did these men say and where did they come from and hezekiah said they came from a far country even from babylon
 and he said what have they seen in your house and hezekiah said in answer they saw everything in my house there is nothing among my stores which i did not let them see
 then said isaiah to hezekiah give ear to the word of the lord of armies
 truly the days are coming when everything in your house and whatever your fathers have put in store till this day will be taken away to babylon all will be gone
 and your sons even your offspring will they take away to be unsexed servants in the house of the king of babylon
 then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which you have said and he said in his heart there will be peace and quiet in my days
 and in that day seven women will put their hands on one man saying there will be no need for you to give us food or clothing only let us go under your name so that our shame may be taken away
 in that day will the young growth of the lord be beautiful in glory and the fruit of the earth will be the pride of those who are still living in israel
 and it will come about that the rest of the living in zion and of those who have been kept from destruction in jerusalem will be named holy even everyone who has been recorded for life in jerusalem
 when zion has been washed from her sin by the lord and jerusalem made clean from her blood by a judging and a burning wind
 and over every living place on mount zion all over all her meetings the lord will make a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for over all the glory of the lord will be a cover and a tent
 and a shade in the daytime from the heat and a safe cover from storm and from rain
 give comfort give comfort to my people says your god
 say kind words to the heart of jerusalem crying out to her that her time of trouble is ended that her punishment is complete that she has been rewarded by the lords hand twice over for all her sins
 a voice of one crying make ready in the waste land the way of the lord make level in the lowland a highway for our god
 let every valley be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low and let the rough places become level and the hilltops become a valley
 and the glory of the lord will be made clear and all flesh will see it together for the mouth of the lord has said it
 a voice of one saying give a cry  and i said what is my cry to be all flesh is grass and all its strength like the flower of the field
 the grass becomes dry the flower is dead because the breath of the lord goes over it truly the people is grass
 the grass is dry the flower is dead but the word of our god is eternal
 you who give good news to zion get up into the high mountain you who give good news to jerusalem let your voice be strong let it be sounding without fear say to the towns of judah see your god 
 see the lord god will come as a strong one ruling in power see those made free by him are with him and those whom he has made safe go before him
 he will give food to his flock like a keeper of sheep with his arm he will get it together and will take up the lambs on his breast gently guiding those which are with young
 in the hollow of whose hand have the waters been measured and who is able to take the heavens in his stretched out fingers who has got together the dust of the earth in a measure who has taken the weight of the mountains or put the hills into the scales
 by whom has the spirit of the lord been guided or who has been his teacher
 who gave him suggestions and made clear to him the right way who gave him knowledge guiding him in the way of wisdom
 see the nations are to him like a drop hanging from a bucket and like the small dust in the scales he takes up the islands like small dust
 and lebanon is not enough to make a fire with or all its cattle enough for a burned offering
 all the nations are as nothing before him even less than nothing a thing of no value
 whom then is god like in your opinion or what will you put forward as a comparison with him
 the workman makes an image and the gold worker puts gold plates over it and makes silver bands for it
 the wise workman makes selection of the mulberry tree of the offering a wood which will not become soft so that the image may be fixed to it and not be moved
 have you no knowledge of it has it not come to your ears has not news of it been given to you from the first has it not been clear to you from the time when the earth was placed on its base
 it is he who is seated over the arch of the earth and the people in it are as small as locusts by him the heavens are stretched out like an arch and made ready like a tent for a living place
 he makes rulers come to nothing the judges of the earth are of no value
 they have only now been planted and their seed put into the earth and they have only now taken root when he sends out his breath over them and they become dry and the storm wind takes them away like dry grass
 who then seems to you to be my equal says the holy one
 let your eyes be lifted up on high and see who has made these he who sends out their numbered army who has knowledge of all their names by whose great strength because he is strong in power all of them are in their places
 why do you say o jacob such words as these o israel the lords eyes are not on my way and my god gives no attention to my cause
 have you no knowledge of it has it not come to your ears the eternal god the lord the maker of the ends of the earth is never feeble or tired there is no searching out of his wisdom
 he gives power to the feeble increasing the strength of him who has no force
 even the young men will become feeble and tired and the best of them will come to the end of his strength
 but those who are waiting for the lord will have new strength they will get wings like eagles running they will not be tired and walking they will have no weariness
 come quietly before me o sea lands and let the peoples get together their strength let them come near then let them say what they have to say let us put forward our cause against one another
 who sent out from the east one who is right wherever he goes he gives the nations into his hands and makes him ruler over kings he gives them as the dust to his sword as dry stems before the wind to his bow
 he goes after them safely not touching the road with his feet
 whose purpose and work was it his who sent out the generations from the start i the lord the first and with the last i am he
 the sea lands saw it and were in fear the ends of the earth were shaking they came near
 they gave help everyone to his neighbour and everyone said to his brother take heart 
 so the metal worker put heart into the gold worker and he who was hammering the metal smooth said kind words to the iron worker saying of the plate it is ready and he put it together with nails so that there might be no slipping
 but as for you israel my servant and you jacob whom i have taken for myself the seed of abraham my friend
 you whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and sent for from its farthest parts saying to you you are my servant whom i have taken for myself and whom i have not given up
 have no fear for i am with you do not be looking about in trouble for i am your god i will give you strength yes i will be your helper yes my true right hand will be your support
 truly all those who are angry with you will be made low and put to shame those desiring to do you wrong will come to nothing and never again be seen
 you will make search for your haters but they will not be there those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction
 for i the lord your god have taken your right hand in mine saying to you have no fear i will be your helper
 have no fear you worm jacob and you men of israel i will be your helper says the lord even he who takes up your cause the holy one of israel
 see i will make you like a new grain crushing instrument with teeth crushing the mountains small and making the hills like dry stems
 you will send the wind over them and it will take them away they will go in all directions before the storm wind you will have joy in the lord and be glad in the holy one of israel
 the poor and crushed are looking for water where no water is and their tongue is dry for need of it i the lord will give ear to their prayer i the god of israel will not give them up
 i will make rivers on the dry mountain tops and fountains in the valleys i will make the waste land a pool of water and the dry land springs of water
 i will put in the waste land the cedar the acacia the myrtle and the olive tree and in the lowland will be planted the fir tree the plane and the cypress together
 so that they may see and be wise and give their mind to it and that it may be clear to them all that the hand of the lord has done this and that the holy one of israel has made it
 put forward your cause says the lord let your strong argument come out says the king of jacob
 let the future be made clear to us give us news of the past things so that we may give thought to them or of the things to come so that we may see if they are true
 give us word of what will be after this so that we may be certain that you are gods yes do good or do evil so that we may all see it and be surprised
 but you are nothing and your work is of no value foolish is he who takes you for his gods
 i have sent for one from the north and from the dawn he has come in my name he will get rulers together and go against them they will be like dust even as the wet earth is stamped on by the feet of the potter
 who has given knowledge of it from the first so that we may be certain of it and from the start so that we may say his word is true there is no one who gives news or says anything or who gives ear to your words
 i was the first to give word of it to zion and i gave the good news to jerusalem
 and i saw that there was no man even no wise man among them who might give an answer to my questions
 truly they are all nothing their works are nothing and of no value their metal images are of no more use than wind
 see my servant whom i am supporting my loved one in whom i take delight i have put my spirit on him he will give the knowledge of the true god to the nations
 he will make no cry his voice will not be loud his words will not come to mens ears in the streets
 he will not let a crushed stem be quite broken and he will not let a feebly burning light be put out he will go on sending out the true word to the peoples
 his light will not be put out and he will not be crushed till he has given the knowledge of the true god to the earth and the sea lands will be waiting for his teaching
 god the lord even he who made the heavens measuring them out on high stretching out the earth and giving its produce he who gives breath to the people on it and life to those who go about on it says
 i the lord have made you the vessel of my purpose i have taken you by the hand and kept you safe and i have given you to be an agreement to the people and a light to the nations
 to give eyes to the blind to make free the prisoners from the prison to let out those who are shut up in the dark
 i am the lord that is my name i will not give my glory to another or my praise to pictured images
 see the things said before have come about and now i give word of new things before they come i give you news of them
 make a new song to the lord and let his praise be sounded from the end of the earth you who go down to the sea and everything in it the sea lands and their people
 let the waste land and its flocks be glad the tent circles of kedar let the people of the rock give a glad cry from the top of the mountains let them make a sound of joy
 let them give glory to the lord sounding his praise in the sea lands
 the lord will go out as a man of war he will be moved to wrath like a fighting man his voice will be strong he will give a loud cry he will go against his attackers like a man of war
 i have long been quiet i have kept myself in and done nothing now i will make sounds of pain like a woman in childbirth breathing hard and quickly
 i will make waste mountains and hills drying up all their plants and i will make rivers dry and pools dry land
 and i will take the blind by a way of which they had no knowledge guiding them by roads strange to them i will make the dark places light before them and the rough places level these things will i do and will not give them up
 they will be turned back and be greatly shamed who put their hope in pictured images who say to metal images you are our gods
 give ear you whose ears are shut and let your eyes be open you blind so that you may see
 who is blind but my servant who has his ears stopped but he whom i send who is blind as my true one or who has his ears shut like the lords servant
 seeing much but keeping nothing in mind his ears are open but there is no hearing
 it was the lords pleasure because of his righteousness to make the teaching great and give it honour
 but this is a people whose property has been taken away from them by force they are all taken in holes and shut up in prisons they are made prisoners and no one makes them free they are taken by force and no one says give them back
 who is there among you who will give ear to this who will give attention to it for the time to come
 who gave up jacob to those who took away his goods and israel to his attackers did not the lord he against whom they did wrong and in whose ways they would not go turning away from his teaching
 for this reason he let loose on him the heat of his wrath and his strength was like a flame and it put fire round about him but he did not see it he was burned but did not take it to heart
 but now says the lord your maker o jacob and your life giver o israel have no fear for i have taken up your cause naming you by your name i have made you mine
 when you go through the waters i will be with you and through the rivers they will not go over you when you go through the fire you will not be burned and the flame will have no power over you
 for i am the lord your god the holy one of israel your saviour i have given egypt as a price for you ethiopia and seba for you
 because of your value in my eyes you have been honoured and loved by me so i will give men for you and peoples for your life
 have no fear for i am with you i will take your seed from the east and get you together from the west
 i will say to the north give them up and to the south do not keep them back send back my sons from far and my daughters from the end of the earth
 every one who is named by my name and whom i have made for my glory who has been formed and designed by me
 send out the blind people who have eyes and those who have ears but they are shut
 let all the nations come together and let the peoples be present who among them is able to make this clear and give us word of earlier things let their witnesses come forward so that they may be seen to be true and that they may give ear and say it is true
 you are my witnesses says the lord and my servant whom i have taken for myself so that you may see and have faith in me and that it may be clear to you that i am he before me there was no god formed and there will not be after me
 i even i am the lord and there is no saviour but me
 i gave the word and made it clear and there was no strange god among you for this reason you are my witnesses says the lord
 from time long past i am god and from this day i am he there is no one who is able to take you out of my hand when i undertake a thing by whom will my purpose be changed
 the lord who has taken up your cause the holy one of israel says because of you i have sent to babylon and made all their seers come south and the chaldaeans whose cry is in the ships
 i am the lord your holy one the maker of israel your king
 this is the word of the lord who makes a way in the sea and a road through the deep waters
 who sends out the war carriages and the horses the army with all its force they have come down they will not get up again like a feebly burning light they are put out
 give no thought to the things which are past let the early times go out of your minds
 see i am doing a new thing now it is starting will you not take note of it i will even make a way in the waste land and rivers in the dry country
 the beasts of the field will give me honour the jackals and the ostriches because i send out waters in the waste land and rivers in the dry country to give drink to the people whom i have taken for myself
 even the people whom i made to be the witnesses of my praise
 but you have made no prayer to me o jacob and you have given no thought to me o israel
 you have not made me burned offerings of sheep or given me honour with your offerings of beasts i did not make you servants to give me an offering and i did not make you tired with requests for perfumes
 you have not got me sweet smelling plants with your money or given me pleasure with the fat of your offerings but you have made me a servant to your sins and you have made me tired with your evil doings
 i even i am he who takes away your sins and i will no longer keep your evil doings in mind
 put me in mind of this let us take up the cause between us put forward your cause so that you may be seen to be in the right
 your first father was a sinner and your guides have gone against my word
 your chiefs have made my holy place unclean so i have made jacob a curse and israel a thing of shame
 and now give ear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have taken for myself
 the lord who made you forming you in your mothers body the lord your helper says have no fear o jacob my servant and you jeshurun whom i have taken for myself
 for i will send water on the land needing it and streams on the dry earth i will let my spirit come down on your seed and my blessing on your offspring
 and they will come up like grass in a well watered field like water plants by the streams
 one will say i am the lords and another will give himself the name jacob another will put a mark on his hand i am the lords and another will take the name of israel for himself
 the lord the king of israel even the lord of armies who has taken up his cause says i am the first and the last and there is no god but me
 if there is one like me let him come forward and say it let him make it clear and put it in order before me who has made clear in the past the things to come let him make clear the future to me
 have no fear be strong in heart have i not made it clear to you in the past and let you see it and you are my witnesses is there any god but me or a rock of whom i have no knowledge
 those who make a pictured image are all of them as nothing and the things of their desire will be of no profit to them and their servants see not and have no knowledge so they will be put to shame
 whoever makes a god makes nothing but a metal image in which there is no profit
 truly all those who make use of secret arts will be put to shame and their words of power are only words of men let them all come forward together they will all be in fear and be put to shame
 the iron worker is heating the metal in the fire giving it form with his hammers and working on it with his strong arm then for need of food his strength gives way and for need of water he becomes feeble
 the woodworker is measuring out the wood with his line marking it out with his pencil after smoothing it with his plane and making circles on it with his instrument he gives it the form and glory of a man so that it may be placed in the house
 he has cedars cut down for himself he takes an oak and lets it get strong among the trees of the wood he has an ash tree planted and the rain gives it growth
 then it will be used to make a fire so that a man may get warm he has the oven heated with it and makes bread he makes a god with it to which he gives worship he makes a pictured image out of it and goes down on his face before it
 with part of it he makes a fire and on the fire he gets meat cooked and takes a full meal he makes himself warm and says aha  i am warm i have seen the fire
 and the rest of it he makes into a god even his pictured image he goes down on his face before it giving worship to it and making prayer to it saying be my saviour for you are my god
 they have no knowledge or wisdom for he has put a veil over their eyes so that they may not see and on their hearts so that they may not give attention
 and no one takes note no one has enough knowledge or wisdom to say i have put part of it in the fire and made bread on it i have had a meal of the flesh cooked with it and am i now to make the rest of it into a false god am i to go down on my face before a bit of wood
 as for him whose food is the dust of a dead fire he has been turned from the way by a twisted mind so that he is unable to keep himself safe by saying what i have here in my hand is false
 keep these things in mind o jacob and you israel for you are my servant i have made you you are my servant o israel i will not let you go out of my memory
 i have put your evil doings out of my mind like a thick cloud and your sins like a mist come back to me for i have taken up your cause
 make a song o heavens for the lord has done it give a loud cry you deep parts of the earth let your voices be loud in song you mountains and you woods with all your trees for the lord has taken up the cause of jacob and will let his glory be seen in israel
 the lord who has taken up your cause and who gave you life in your mothers body says i am the lord who makes all things stretching out the heavens by myself and giving the earth its limits who was with me
 who makes the signs of those who give word of the future come to nothing so that those who have knowledge of secret arts go off their heads turning the wise men back and making their knowledge foolish
 who makes the word of his servants certain and gives effect to the purposes of his representatives who says of jerusalem her people will come back to her and of the towns of judah i will give orders for their building and will make her waste places fertile again
 who says to the deep be dry and i will make your rivers dry
 who says of cyrus he will take care of my sheep and will do all my pleasure who says of jerusalem i will give the word for your building and of the temple your bases will be put in place
 the lord says to the man of his selection to cyrus whom i have taken by the right hand putting down nations before him and taking away the arms of kings making the doors open before him so that the ways into the towns may not be shut
 i will go before you and make the rough places level the doors of brass will be broken and the iron rods cut in two
 and i will give you the stores of the dark and the wealth of secret places so that you may be certain that i am the lord who gave you your name even the god of israel
 because of jacob my servant and israel whom i have taken for myself i have sent for you by name giving you a name of honour though you had no knowledge of me
 i am the lord and there is no other there is no god but me i will make you ready for war though you had no knowledge of me
 so that they may see from the east and from the west that there is no god but me i am the lord and there is no other
 i am the giver of light and the maker of the dark causing blessing and sending troubles i am the lord who does all these things
 let righteousness come down o heavens from on high and let the sky send it down like rain let the earth be open to give the fruit of salvation causing righteousness to come up with it i the lord have made it come about
 cursed is he who has an argument with his maker the pot which has an argument with the potter  will the wet earth say to him who is working with it what are you doing that your work has nothing by which it may be gripped
 cursed is he who says to a father to what are you giving life or to a woman what are you in birth pains with
 the lord the holy one of israel and his maker says will you put a question to me about the things which are to come or will you give me orders about my sons and the work of my hands
 i have made the earth forming man on it by my hands the heavens have been stretched out and all the stars put in their ordered places
 i have sent him out to overcome the nations and i will make all his ways straight i will give him the work of building my town and he will let my prisoners go free without price or reward says the lord of armies
 the lord says the workmen of egypt and the traders of ethiopia and the tall sabaeans will come over the sea to you and they will be yours they will go after you in chains they will come over and they will go down on their faces before you and will make prayer to you saying truly god is among you and there is no other god
 truly you have a secret god the god of israel is a saviour 
 all those who have gone against him will be put to shame the makers of images will be made low
 but the lord will make israel free with an eternal salvation you will not be put to shame or made low for ever and ever
 for this is the word of the lord who made the heavens he is god the maker and designer of the earth who made it not to be a waste but as a living place for man i am the lord and there is no other
 i have not given my word in secret in a place in the underworld i did not say to the seed of jacob go into a waste land to make request of me i the lord say what is true my word is righteousness
 come together even come near you nations who are still living they have no knowledge who take up their image of wood and make prayer to a god in whom is no salvation
 give the word put forward your cause let us have a discussion together who has given news of this in the past who made it clear in early times did not i the lord and there is no god but me a true god and a saviour there is no other
 let your hearts be turned to me so that you may have salvation all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is no other
 by myself have i taken an oath a true word has gone from my mouth and will not be changed that to me every knee will be bent and every tongue will give honour
 only in the lord will jacob overcome and be strong together all those who were angry with him will be put to shame and come to destruction
 in the lord will all the seed of israel get their rights and they will give glory to him
 bel is bent down nebo is falling their images are on the beasts and on the cattle the things which you took about have become a weight to the tired beast
 they are bent down they are falling together they were not able to keep their images safe but they themselves have been taken prisoner
 give ear to me o family of jacob and all the rest of the people of israel who have been supported by me from their birth and have been my care from their earliest days
 even when you are old i will be the same and when you are grey haired i will take care of you i will still be responsible for what i made yes i will take you and keep you safe
 who in your eyes is my equal or what comparison will you make with me
 as for those who take gold out of a bag and put silver in the scales they give payment to a gold worker to make it into a god they go down on their faces and give it worship
 they put him on their backs and take him up and put him in his fixed place from which he may not be moved if a man gives a cry for help to him he is unable to give an answer or get him out of his trouble
 keep this in mind and be shamed let it come back to your memory you sinners
 let the things which are past come to your memory for i am god and there is no other i am god and there is no one like me
 making clear from the first what is to come and from past times the things which have not so far come about saying my purpose is fixed and i will do all my pleasure
 sending for a bird of strong flight from the east the man of my purpose from a far country i have said it and i will give effect to it the thing designed by me will certainly be done
 give ear to me you feeble hearted who have no faith in my righteousness
 my righteousness is near it is not far off salvation will come quickly and i will make zion free and give israel my glory
 come and take your seat in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon come down from your seat of power and take your place on the earth o daughter of the chaldaeans for you will never again seem soft and delicate
 take the crushing stones and get the meal crushed take off your veil put away your robe let your legs be uncovered go through the rivers
 the shame of your unclothed condition will be seen by all i will give punishment without mercy
 says the lord who takes up our cause the lord of armies is his name the holy one of israel
 be seated in the dark without a word o daughter of the chaldaeans for you will no longer be named the queen of kingdoms
 i was angry with my people i put shame on my heritage and gave them into your hands you had no mercy on them you put a cruel yoke on those who were old
 and you said i will be a queen for ever you did not give attention to these things and did not keep in mind what would come after
 so now take note of this you who are given up to pleasure living without fear of evil saying in your heart i am and there is no one like me i will never be a widow or have my children taken from me
 but these two things will come on you suddenly in one day the loss of children and of husband in full measure they will come on you for all your secret arts and all your wonders
 for you had faith in your evil doing you said no one sees me by your wisdom and knowledge you have been turned out of the way and you have said in your heart i am and there is no other
 because of this evil will come on you which may not be turned away for any price and trouble will overtake you from which no money will give salvation destruction will come on you suddenly without your knowledge
 go on now with your secret arts and all your wonder working to which you have given yourself up from your earliest days it may be that they will be of profit to you or by them you may put fear into your attackers
 but your mind is troubled by the number of your guides let them now come forward for your salvation the measurers of the heavens the watchers of the stars and those who are able to say from month to month what things are coming on you
 truly they have become like dry stems they have been burned in the fire they are not able to keep themselves safe from the power of the flame it is not a coal for warming them or a fire by which a man may be seated
 small profit have you had from those who from your earliest days got great profit out of you they have gone in flight every one straight before him and you have no saviour
 give ear to this o family of jacob you who are named by the name of israel and have come out of the body of judah who take oaths by the name of the lord and make use of the name of the god of israel but not truly and not in good faith
 for they say that they are of the holy town and put their faith in the god of israel the lord of armies is his name
 i gave word in the past of the things which came about they came from my mouth and i made them clear suddenly i did them and they came about
 because i saw that your heart was hard and that your neck was an iron cord and your brow brass
 for this reason i made it clear to you in the past before it came i gave you word of it for fear that you might say my god did these things and my pictured and metal images made them come about
 all this has come to your ears and you have seen it will you not give witness to it i am now making clear new things even secret things of which you had no knowledge
 they have only now been effected and not in the past and before this day they had not come to your ears for fear that you might say i had knowledge of them
 truly you had no word of them no knowledge of them no news of them in the past had come to your ears because i saw how false was your behaviour and that your heart was turned against me from your earliest days
 because of my name i will put away my wrath and for my praise i will keep myself from cutting you off
 see i have been testing you for myself like silver i have put you through the fire of trouble
 for myself even because of my name i will do it for i will not let my name be shamed and my glory i will not give to another
 give ear to me jacob and israel my loved one i am he i am the first and i am the last
 yes by my hand was the earth placed on its base and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out at my word they take up their places
 come together all of you and give ear who among you has given news of these things the lords loved one will do his pleasure with babylon and with the seed of the chaldaeans
 i even i have given the word i have sent for him i have made him come and have given effect to his undertakings
 come near to me and give ear to this from the start i did not keep it secret from the time of its coming into existence i was there and now the lord god has sent me and given me his spirit
 the lord who takes up your cause the holy one of israel says i am the lord your god who is teaching you for your profit guiding you by the way in which you are to go
 if only you had given ear to my orders then your peace would have been like a river and your righteousness as the waves of the sea
 your seed would have been like the sand and your offspring like the dust your name would not be cut off or come to an end before me
 go out of babylon go in flight from the chaldaeans with the sound of song make it clear give the news let the word go out even to the end of the earth say the lord has taken up the cause of his servant jacob
 they had no need of water when he was guiding them through the waste lands he made water come out of the rock for them the rock was parted and the waters came flowing out
 there is no peace says the lord for the evil doers
 give ear o sea lands to me and take note you peoples from far i have been marked out by the lord from the first when i was still in my mothers body he had my name in mind
 and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shade of his hand he has kept me and he has made me like a polished arrow keeping me in his secret place
 and he said to me you are my servant israel in whom my glory will be seen
 and i said i have undergone weariness for nothing i have given my strength for no purpose or profit but still the lord will take up my cause and my god will give me my reward
 and now says the lord who made me his servant when i was still in my mothers body so that i might make jacob come back to him and so that israel might come together to him and i was honoured in the eyes of the lord and my god became my strength
 it is not enough for one who is my servant to put the tribes of jacob again in their place and to get back those of israel who have been sent away my purpose is to give you as a light to the nations so that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth
 the lord who takes up israels cause even his holy one says to him whom men make sport of who is hated by the nations a servant of rulers kings will see and get up from their places and chiefs will give worship because of the lord who keeps faith even the holy one of israel who has taken you for himself
 this is the word of the lord i have given ear to you at a good time and i have been your helper in a day of salvation and i will keep you safe and will make you a glory for the people putting the land in order and giving them the heritages which now are waste
 saying to those who are in chains go free to those who are in the dark come out into the light they will get food by the way wherever they go and have grass lands on all the dry mountain tops
 they will not be in need of food or drink or be troubled by the heat or the sun for he who has mercy on them will be their guide taking them by the springs of water
 and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways will be lifted up
 see these are coming from far and these from the north and the west and these from the land of sinim
 let your voice be loud in song o heavens and be glad o earth make sounds of joy o mountains for the lord has given comfort to his people and will have mercy on his crushed ones
 but zion said the lord has given me up i have gone from his memory
 will a woman give up the child at her breast will she be without pity for the fruit of her body yes these may but i will not let you go out of my memory
 see your name is marked on my hands your walls are ever before me
 your builders are coming quickly your haters and those who made you waste will go out of you
 let your eyes be lifted up round about and see they are all coming together to you by my life says the lord truly you will put them all on you as an ornament and be clothed with them like a bride
 for though the waste places of your land have been given to destruction now you will not be wide enough for your people and those who made you waste will be far away
 the children to whom you gave birth in other lands will say in your ears the place is not wide enough for me make room for me to have a resting place
 then you will say in your heart who has given me all these children when my children had been taken from me and i was no longer able to have others who took care of these when i was by myself where then were these
 this is the word of the lord god see i will make a sign with my hand to the nations and put up my flag for the peoples and they will take up your sons on their beasts and your daughters on their backs
 and kings will take care of you and queens will give you their milk they will go down on their faces before you kissing the dust of your feet and you will be certain that i am the lord and that those who put their hope in me will not be shamed
 will the goods of war be taken from the strong man or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go
 but the lord says even the prisoners of the strong will be taken from him and the cruel made to let go his goods for i will take up your cause against your haters and i will keep your children safe
 and the flesh of your attackers will be taken by themselves for food and they will take their blood for drink as if it was sweet wine and all men will see that i the lord am your saviour even he who takes up your cause the strong one of jacob
 let me make a song about my loved one a song of love for his vine garden my loved one had a vine garden on a fertile hill
 and after working the earth of it with a spade he took away its stones and put in it a very special vine and he put up a watchtower in the middle of it hollowing out in the rock a place for the grape crushing and he was hoping that it would give the best grapes but it gave common grapes
 and now you people of jerusalem and you men of judah be the judges between me and my vine garden
 is there anything which might have been done for my vine garden which i have not done why then when i was hoping for the best grapes did it give me common grapes
 and now this is what i will do to my vine garden i will take away the circle of thorns round it and it will be burned up its wall will be broken down and the beasts of the field will go through it
 and i will make it waste its branches will not be touched with the knife or the earth worked with the spade but blackberries and thorns will come up in it and i will give orders to the clouds not to send rain on it
 for the vine garden of the lord of armies is the people of israel and the men of judah are the plant of his delight and he was looking for upright judging and there was blood for righteousness and there was a cry for help
 cursed are those who are joining house to house and putting field to field till there is no more living space for any but themselves in all the land 
 the lord of armies has said to me secretly truly numbers of great and fair houses will be waste with no one living in them
 for ten fields of vines will only give one measure of wine and a great amount of seed will only give a small measure of grain
 cursed are those who get up early in the morning to give themselves up to strong drink who keep on drinking far into the night till they are heated with wine 
 and corded instruments and wind instruments and wine are in their feasts but they give no thought to the work of the lord and they are not interested in what his hands are doing
 for this cause my people are taken away as prisoners into strange countries for need of knowledge and their rulers are wasted for need of food and their loud voiced feasters are dry for need of water
 for this cause the underworld has made wide its throat opening its mouth without limit and her glory and the noise of her masses and her loud voiced feasters will go down into it
 and the poor mans head is bent and the great man goes down on his face and the eyes of pride are put to shame
 but the lord of armies is lifted up as judge and the holy god is seen to be holy in righteousness
 then the lambs will get food as in their grass lands and the fat cattle will be feasting in the waste places
 cursed are those who make use of ox cords for pulling the evil thing and the bands of a young ox for their sin 
 who say let him do his work quickly let him make it sudden so that we may see it let the design of the holy one of israel come near so that it may be clear to us
 cursed are those who give the name of good to evil and of evil to what is good who make light dark and dark light who make bitter sweet and sweet bitter 
 cursed are those who seem wise to themselves and who take pride in their knowledge 
 cursed are those who are strong to take wine and great in making mixed drinks 
 who for a reward give support to the cause of the sinner and who take away the righteousness of the upright from him
 for this cause as the waste of the grain is burned up by tongues of fire and as the dry grass goes down before the flame so their root will be like the dry stems of grain and their flower will go up in dust because they have gone against the law of the lord of armies and have given no honour to the word of the holy one of israel
 for this reason the wrath of the lord has been burning against his people and his hand has been stretched out against them in punishment and the hills were shaking and their dead bodies were like waste in the open places of the town
 and he will let a flag be lifted up as a sign to a far off nation whistling to them from the ends of the earth and they will come quickly and suddenly
 there is no weariness among them and no man is feeble footed they come without resting or sleeping and the cord of their shoes is not broken
 their arrows are sharp and every bow is bent the feet of their horses are like rock and their wheels are like a rushing storm
 the sound of their armies will be like the voice of a lion and their war cry like the noise of young lions with loud cries they will come down on their food and will take it away safely and there will be no one to take it out of their hands
 and his voice will be loud over him in that day like the sounding of the sea and if a mans eyes are turned to the earth it is all dark and full of trouble and the light is made dark by thick clouds
 this is the word of the lord where is the statement which i gave your mother when i put her away or to which of my creditors have i given you for money it was for your sins that you were given into the hands of others and for your evil doing was your mother put away
 why then when i came was there no man and no one to give answer to my voice has my hand become feeble so that it is unable to take up your cause or have i no power to make you free see at my word the sea becomes dry i make the rivers a waste land their fish are dead for need of water and make an evil smell
 by me the heavens are clothed with black and i make haircloth their robe
 the lord god has given me the tongue of those who are experienced so that i may be able to give the word a special sense for the feeble every morning my ear is open to his teaching like those who are experienced
 and i have not put myself against him or let my heart be turned back from him
 i was offering my back to those who gave me blows and my face to those who were pulling out my hair i did not keep my face covered from marks of shame
 for the lord god is my helper i will not be put to shame so i have made my face like a rock and i am certain that he will give me my right
 he who takes up my cause is near who will go to law with me let us come together before the judge who is against me let him come near to me
 see the lord god is my helper who will give a decision against me truly all of them will become old like a robe they will be food for the worm
 who among you has the fear of the lord giving ear to the voice of his servant who has been walking in the dark and has no light let him put his faith in the name of the lord looking to his god for support
 see all you who make a fire arming yourselves with burning branches go in the flame of your fire and among the branches you have put a light to this will you have from my hand you will make your bed in sorrow
 give ear to me you who are searching for righteousness who are looking for the lord see the rock from which you were cut out and the hole out of which you were taken
 let your thoughts be turned to abraham your father and to sarah who gave you birth for when he was but one my voice came to him and i gave him my blessing and made him a great people
 for the lord has given comfort to zion he has made glad all her broken walls making her waste places like eden and changing her dry land into the garden of the lord joy and delight will be there praise and the sound of melody
 give attention to me o my people and give ear to me o my nation for teaching will go out from me and the knowledge of the true god will be a light to the peoples
 suddenly will my righteousness come near and my salvation will be shining out like the light the sea lands will be waiting for me and they will put their hope in my strong arm
 let your eyes be lifted up to the heavens and turned to the earth which is under them for the heavens will go in flight like smoke and the earth will become old like a coat and its people will come to destruction like insects but my salvation will be for ever and my righteousness will not come to an end
 give ear to me you who have knowledge of righteousness in whose heart is my law have no fear of the evil words of men and give no thought to their curses
 for like a coat they will be food for the insect the worm will make a meal of them like wool but my righteousness will be for ever and my salvation to all generations
 awake  awake  put on strength o arm of the lord awake  as in the old days in the generations long past was it not by you that rahab was cut in two and the dragon wounded
 did you not make the sea dry the waters of the great deep did you not make the deep waters of the sea a way for the lords people to go through
 those whom the lord has made free will come back with songs to zion and on their heads will be eternal joy delight and joy will be theirs and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever
 i even i am your comforter are you so poor in heart as to be in fear of man who will come to an end and of the son of man who will be like grass
 and you have given no thought to the lord your maker by whom the heavens were stretched out and the earth placed on its base and you went all day in fear of the wrath of the cruel one when he was making ready for your destruction and where is the wrath of the cruel one
 the prisoner bent under his chain will quickly be made free and will not go down into the underworld and his bread will not come to an end
 for i am the lord your god who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering the lord of armies is his name
 and i have put my words in your mouth covering you with the shade of my hand stretching out the heavens and placing the earth on its base and saying to zion you are my people
 awake  awake  up  o jerusalem you who have taken from the lords hand the cup of his wrath tasting in full measure the wine which overcomes
 she has no one among all her children to be her guide not one of the sons she has taken care of takes her by the hand
 these two things have come on you who will be weeping for you wasting and destruction death from need of food and from the sword how may you be comforted
 your sons are overcome like a roe in a net they are full of the wrath of the lord the punishment of your god
 so now give ear to this you who are troubled and overcome but not with wine
 this is the word of the lord your master even your god who takes up the cause of his people see i have taken out of your hand the cup which overcomes even the cup of my wrath it will not again be given to you
 and i will put it into the hand of your cruel masters and of those whose yoke has been hard on you who have said to your soul down on your face  so that we may go over you and you have given your backs like the earth even like the street for them to go over
 awake  awake  put on your strength o zion put on your beautiful robes o jerusalem the holy town for from now there will never again come into you the unclean and those without circumcision
 make yourself clean from the dust up  and take the seat of your power o jerusalem the bands of your neck are loose o prisoned daughter of zion
 for the lord says you were given for nothing and you will be made free without price
 for the lord god says my people went down at first into egypt to get a place for themselves there and the assyrian put a cruel yoke on them without cause
 now then what have i here says the lord for my people are taken away without cause they are made waste and give cries of sorrow says the lord and all the day the nations put shame on my name
 for this cause i will make my name clear to my people in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them see here am i
 how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who comes with good news who gives word of peace saying that salvation is near who says to zion your god is ruling 
 the voice of your watchmen  their voices are loud in song together for they will see him eye to eye when the lord comes back to zion
 give sounds of joy make melody together waste places of jerusalem for the lord has given comfort to his people he has taken up the cause of jerusalem
 the lord has let his holy arm be seen by the eyes of all nations and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our god
 away  away  go out from there touching no unclean thing go out from among her be clean you who take up the vessels of the lord
 for you will not go out suddenly and you will not go in flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will come after you to keep you
 see my servant will do well in his undertakings he will be honoured and lifted up and be very high
 as peoples were surprised at him and his face was not beautiful so as to be desired his face was so changed by disease as to be unlike that of a man and his form was no longer that of the sons of men
 so will nations give him honour kings will keep quiet because of him for what had not been made clear to them they will see and they will give their minds to what had not come to their ears
 who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears and to whom had the arm of the lord been unveiled
 for his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him and like a root out of a dry place he had no grace of form to give us pleasure
 men made sport of him turning away from him he was a man of sorrows marked by disease and like one from whom mens faces are turned away he was looked down on and we put no value on him
 but it was our pain he took and our diseases were put on him while to us he seemed as one diseased on whom gods punishment had come
 but it was for our sins he was wounded and for our evil doings he was crushed he took the punishment by which we have peace and by his wounds we are made well
 we all went wandering like sheep going every one of us after his desire and the lord put on him the punishment of us all
 men were cruel to him but he was gentle and quiet as a lamb taken to its death and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound so he said not a word
 they took away from him help and right and who gave a thought to his fate for he was cut off from the land of the living he came to his death for the sin of my people
 and they put his body into the earth with sinners and his last resting place was with the evil doers though he had done no wrong and no deceit was in his mouth
 and the lord was pleased  see a seed long life  will do well in his hand 
  made clear his righteousness before men  had taken their sins on himself
 for this cause he will have a heritage with the great and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong because he gave up his life and was numbered with the evil doers taking on himself the sins of the people and making prayer for the wrongdoers
 let your voice be loud in song o woman without children make melody and sounds of joy you who did not give birth for the children of her who had no husband are more than those of the married wife says the lord
 make wide the place of your tent and let the curtains of your house be stretched out without limit make your cords long and your tent pins strong
 for i will make wide your limits on the right hand and on the left and your seed will take the nations for a heritage and make the waste towns full of people
 have no fear for you will not be shamed or without hope you will not be put to shame for the shame of your earlier days will go out of your memory and you will no longer keep in mind the sorrows of your widowed years
 for your maker is your husband the lord of armies is his name and the holy one of israel is he who takes up your cause he will be named the god of all the earth
 for the lord has made you come back to him like a wife who has been sent away in grief of spirit for one may not give up the wife of ones early days
 for a short time i gave you up but with great mercies i will take you back again
 in overflowing wrath my face was veiled from you for a minute but i will have pity on you for ever says the lord who takes up your cause
 for this is like the days of noah to me for as i took an oath that the waters of noah would never again go over the earth so have i taken an oath that i will not again be angry with you or say bitter words to you
 for the mountains may be taken away and the hills be moved out of their places but my love will not be taken from you or my agreement of peace broken says the lord who has had mercy on you
 o troubled one storm crushed uncomforted  see your stones will be framed in fair colours and your bases will be sapphires
 i will make your towers of rubies and your doors of carbuncles and the wall round you will be of all sorts of beautiful stones
 and all your builders will be made wise by the lord and great will be the peace of your children
 all your rights will be made certain to you have no fear of evil and destruction will not come near you
 see they may be moved to war but not by my authority all those who come together to make an attack on you will be broken against you
 see i have made the iron worker blowing on the burning coals and making the instrument of war by his work and i have made the waster for destruction
 no instrument of war which is formed against you will be of any use and every tongue which says evil against you will be judged false this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness comes from me says the lord
 ho  everyone in need come to the waters and he who has no strength let him get food come get bread without money wine and milk without price
 why do you give your money for what is not bread and the fruit of your work for what will not give you pleasure give ear to me so that your food may be good and you may have the best in full measure
 give ear and come to me take note with care so that your souls may have life and i will make an eternal agreement with you even the certain mercies of david
 see i have given him as a witness to the peoples a ruler and a guide to the nations
 see you will send for a nation of which you had no knowledge and those who had no knowledge of you will come running to you because of the lord your god and because of the holy one of israel for he has given you glory
 make search for the lord while he is there make prayer to him while he is near
 let the sinner give up his way and the evil doer his purpose and let him come back to the lord and he will have mercy on him and to our god for there is full forgiveness with him
 for my thoughts are not your thoughts or your ways my ways says the lord
 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
 for as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and does not go back again but gives water to the earth and makes it fertile giving seed to the planter and bread for food
 so will my word be which goes out of my mouth it will not come back to me with nothing done but it will give effect to my purpose and do that for which i have sent it
 for you will go out with joy and be guided in peace the mountains and the hills will make melody before you and all the trees of the fields will make sounds of joy
 in place of the thorn will come up the fir tree and in place of the blackberry the myrtle and it will be to the lord for a name for an eternal sign which will not be cut off
 the lord says let your way of life be upright and let your behaviour be rightly ordered for my salvation is near and my righteousness will quickly be seen
 happy is the man who does this and the son of man whose behaviour is so ordered who keeps the sabbath holy and his hand from doing any evil
 and let not the man from a strange country who has been joined to the lord say the lord will certainly put a division between me and his people and let not the unsexed man say see i am a dry tree
 for the lord says as for the unsexed who keep my sabbaths and give their hearts to pleasing me and keep their agreement with me
 i will give to them in my house and inside my walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters i will give them an eternal name which will not be cut off
 and as for those from a strange country who are joined to the lord to give worship to him and honour to his name to be his servants even everyone who keeps the sabbath holy and keeps his agreement with me
 i will make them come to my holy mountain and will give them joy in my house of prayer i will take pleasure in the burned offerings which they make on my altar for my house will be named a house of prayer for all peoples
 the lord god who gets together the wandering ones of israel says i will get together others in addition to those of israel who have come back
 all you beasts of the field come together for your meat even all you beasts of the wood
 his watchmen are blind they are all without knowledge they are all dogs without tongues unable to make a sound stretched out dreaming loving sleep
 yes the dogs are for ever looking for food while these the keepers of the sheep are without wisdom they have all gone after their pleasure every one looking for profit they are all the same
 come they say i will get wine and we will take strong drink in full measure and tomorrow will be like today full of pleasure
 the upright man goes to his death and no one gives a thought to it and god fearing men are taken away and no one is troubled by it for the upright man is taken away because of evil doing and goes into peace
 they are at rest in their last resting places every one going straight before him
 but come near you sons of her who is wise in secret arts the seed of her who is false to her husband and of the loose woman
 of whom do you make sport against whom is your mouth open wide and your tongue put out are you not uncontrolled children a false seed
 you who are burning with evil desire among the oaks under every green tree putting children to death in the valleys under the cracks of the rocks
 among the smooth stones of the valley is your heritage they even they are your part even to them have you made a drink offering and a meal offering is it possible for such things to be overlooked by me
 you have put your bed on a high mountain there you went up to make your offering
 and on the back of the doors and on the pillars you have put your sign for you have been false to me with another you have made your bed wide and made an agreement with them you had a desire for their bed where you saw it
 and you went to melech with oil and much perfume and you sent your representatives far off and went as low as the underworld
 you were tired with your long journeys but you did not say there is no hope you got new strength and so you were not feeble
 and of whom were you in fear so that you were false and did not keep me in mind or give thought to it have i not been quiet keeping myself secret and so you were not in fear of me
 i will make clear what your righteousness is like and your works you will have no profit in them
 your false gods will not keep you safe in answer to your cry but the wind will take them they will be gone like a breath but he who puts his hope in me will take the land and will have my holy mountain as his heritage
 and i will say make it high make it high get ready the way take the stones out of the way of my people
 for this is the word of him who is high and lifted up whose resting place is eternal whose name is holy my resting place is in the high and holy place and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit to give life to the spirit of the poor and to make strong the heart of the crushed
 for i will not give punishment for ever or be angry without end for from me breath goes out and i it was who made the souls
 i was quickly angry with his evil ways and sent punishment on him veiling my face in wrath and he went on turning his heart from me
 i have seen his ways and i will make him well i will give him rest comforting him and his people who are sad
 i will give the fruit of the lips peace peace to him who is near and to him who is far off says the lord and i will make him well
 but the evil doers are like the troubled sea for which there is no rest and its waters send up earth and waste
 there is no peace says my god for the evil doers
 make a loud cry do not be quiet let your voice be sounding like a horn and make clear to my people their evil doings and to the family of jacob their sins
 though they make prayer to me every day and take pleasure in the knowledge of my ways like a nation which has done righteousness and has not given up the rules of their god they make requests to me for the right orders it is their delight to come near to god
 they say why have we kept ourselves from food and you do not see it why have we kept ourselves from pleasure and you take no note of it if in the days when you keep from food you take the chance to do your business and get in your debts
 if keeping from food makes you quickly angry ready for fighting and giving blows with evil hands your holy days are not such as to make your voice come to my ears on high
 have i given orders for such a day as this a day for keeping yourselves from pleasure is it only a question of the bent head of putting on haircloth and being seated in the dust is this what seems to you a holy day well pleasing to the lord
 is not this the holy day for which i have given orders to let loose those who have wrongly been made prisoners to undo the bands of the yoke and to let the crushed go free and every yoke be broken
 is it not to give your bread to those in need and to let the poor who have no resting place come into your house to put a robe on the unclothed one when you see him and not to keep your eyes shut for fear of seeing his flesh
 then will light be shining on you like the morning and your wounds will quickly be well and your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the lord will come after you
 then at the sound of your voice the lord will give an answer at your cry he will say here am i if you take away from among you the yoke the putting out of the finger of shame and the evil word
 and if you give your bread to those in need of it so that the troubled one may have his desire then you will have light in the dark and your night will be as the full light of the sun
 and the lord will be your guide at all times in dry places he will give you water in full measure and will make strong your bones and you will be like a watered garden and like an ever flowing spring
 and your sons will be building again the old waste places you will make strong the bases of old generations and you will be named he who puts up the broken walls and he who makes ready the ways for use
 if you keep the sabbath with care not doing your business on my holy day and if the sabbath seems to you a delight and the new moon of the lord a thing to be honoured and if you give respect to him by not doing your business or going after your pleasure or saying unholy words
 then the lord will be your delight and i will put you on the high places of the earth and i will give you the heritage of jacob your father for the mouth of the lord has said it
 truly the lords hand has not become short so that he is unable to give salvation and his ear is not shut from hearing
 but your sins have come between you and your god and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you so that he will give you no answer
 for your hands are unclean with blood and your fingers with sin your lips have said false things and your tongue gives out deceit
 no one puts forward an upright cause or gives a true decision their hope is in deceit and their words are false they are with child with sin and give birth to evil
 they give birth to snakes eggs and make spiders threads whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison snake
 their twisted threads will not make clothing and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves their works are works of sin and violent acts are in their hands
 their feet go quickly to evil and they take delight in the death of the upright their thoughts are thoughts of sin wasting and destruction are in their ways
 they have no knowledge of the way of peace and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour they have made for themselves ways which are not straight whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace
 for this cause our right is far from us and righteousness does not overtake us we are looking for light but there is only the dark for the shining of the sun but our way is in the night
 we go on our way like blind men feeling for the wall even like those who have no eyes we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening our place is in the dark like dead men
 we make noises of grief like bears and sad sounds like doves we are looking for our right but it is not there for salvation but it is far from us
 for our evil doings are increased before you and our sins give witness against us for our evil doings are with us and we have knowledge of our sins
 we have gone against the lord and been false to him turning away from our god our words have been uncontrolled and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit
 and the right is turned back and righteousness is far away for good faith is not to be seen in the public places and upright behaviour may not come into the town
 yes faith is gone and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel and the lord saw it and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause
 and he saw that there was no man and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause so his arm gave salvation and he made righteousness his support
 yes he put on righteousness as a breastplate and salvation as a head dress and he put on punishment as clothing and wrath as a robe
 he will give them the right reward of their doings wrath to his attackers punishment to his haters and even on the sea lands he will send punishment
 so they will see the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the east for he will come like a rushing stream forced on by a wind of the lord
 and as a saviour he will come to zion turning away sin from jacob says the lord
 and as for me this is my agreement with them says the lord my spirit which is on you and my words which i have put in your mouth will not go away from your mouth or from the mouth of your seed or from the mouth of your seeds seed says the lord from now and for ever
 in the year of king uzziahs death i saw the lord seated in his place high and lifted up and the temple was full of the wide skirts of his robe
 over him were the winged ones every one had six wings two for covering his face two for covering his feed and two for flight
 and one said in a loud voice to another holy holy holy is the lord of armies all the earth is full of his glory
 and the bases of the door pillars were shaking at the sound of his cry and the house was full of smoke
 then i said the curse is on me and my fate is destruction for i am a man of unclean lips living among a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the lord of armies
 then a winged one came to me with a burning coal in his hand which he had taken from off the altar with the fire spoon
 and after touching my mouth with it he said see your lips have been touched with this and your evil is taken away and you are made clean from sin
 and the voice of the lord came to my ears saying whom am i to send and who will go for us then i said here am i send me
 and he said go and say to this people you will go on hearing but learning nothing you will go on seeing but without getting wiser
 make the hearts of this people fat and let their ears be stopped and their eyes shut for fear that they may see with their eyes and be hearing with their ears and their heart may become wise and they may be turned to me and made well
 then i said lord how long and he said in answer till the towns are waste and unpeopled and the houses have no men and the land becomes completely waste
 and the lord has taken men far away and there are wide waste places in the land
 and even if there is still a tenth part in it it will again be burned like a tree of the woods whose broken end is still in the earth after the tree has been cut down  the holy seed is the broken end 
 up  let your face be bright for your light has come and the glory of the lord is shining on you
 for truly the earth will be dark and the peoples veiled in blackest night but the lord will be shining on you and his glory will be seen among you
 and nations will come to your light and kings to your bright dawn
 let your eyes be lifted up and see they are all coming together to you your sons will come from far and your daughters taken with loving care
 then you will see and be bright with joy and your heart will be shaking with increase of delight for the produce of the sea will be turned to you the wealth of the nations will come to you
 you will be full of camel trains even the young camels of midian and ephah all from sheba will come with gold and spices giving word of the great acts of the lord
 all the flocks of kedar will come together to you the sheep of nebaioth will be ready for your need they will be pleasing offerings on my altar and my house of prayer will be beautiful
 who are these coming like a cloud like a flight of doves to their windows
 vessels of the sea lands are waiting for me and the ships of tarshish first so that your sons may come from far and their silver and gold with them to the place of the name of the lord your god and to the holy one of israel because he has made you beautiful
 and men from strange countries will be building up your walls and their kings will be your servants for in my wrath i sent punishment on you but in my grace i have had mercy on you
 your doors will be open at all times they will not be shut day or night so that men may come into you with the wealth of the nations with their kings at their head
 for the nation or kingdom which will not be your servant will come to destruction such nations will be completely waste
 the glory of lebanon will come to you the cypress the plane and the sherbin tree together to make my holy place beautiful and the resting place of my feet will be full of glory
 and the sons of those who were cruel to you will come before you with bent heads and those who made sport of you will go down on their faces at your feet and you will be named the town of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel
 and though you were turned away from and hated and had no helper i will make you a pride for ever a joy from generation to generation
 and you will take the milk of the nations flowing from the breast of kings and you will see that i the lord am your saviour and he who takes up your cause the strong one of jacob
 in place of brass i will give gold and for iron silver and for wood brass and for stones iron and i will make peace your judge and righteousness your overseer
 violent acts will no longer be seen in your land wasting or destruction in your limits but your walls will be named salvation and your doors praise
 the sun will not be your light by day and the moon will no longer be bright for you by night but the lord will be to you an eternal light and your god your glory
 your sun will never again go down or your moon keep back her light for the lord will be your eternal light and the days of your sorrow will be ended
 your people will all be upright the land will be their heritage for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands to be for my glory
 the smallest of their families will become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will make it come quickly in its time
 the spirit of the lord is on me because i am marked out by him to give good news to the poor he has sent me to make the broken hearted well to say that the prisoners will be made free and that those in chains will see the light again
 to give knowledge that the year of the lords good pleasure has come and the day of punishment from our god to give comfort to all who are sad
 to give them a fair head dress in place of dust the oil of joy in place of the clothing of grief praise in place of sorrow so that they may be named trees of righteousness the planting of the lord and so that he may have glory
 and they will be building again the old broken walls and will make new the old waste places and will put up again the towns which have been waste for long generations
 and men from strange countries will be your herdsmen and those who are not israelites will be your ploughmen and vine keepers
 but you will be named the priests of the lord the servants of our god you will have the wealth of the nations for your food and you will be clothed with their glory
 as they had twice as much grief and marks of shame were their heritage so in their land they will be rewarded twice over and will have eternal joy
 for i the lord take pleasure in upright judging i will not put up with the violent taking away of right and i will certainly give them their reward and i will make an eternal agreement with them
 and their seed will be noted among the nations and their offspring among the peoples it will be clear to all who see them that they are the seed to which the lord has given his blessing
 i will be full of joy in the lord my soul will be glad in my god for he has put on me the clothing of salvation covering me with the robe of righteousness as the husband puts on a fair head dress and the bride makes herself beautiful with jewels
 for as the earth puts out buds and as the garden gives growth to the seeds which are planted in it so the lord will make righteousness and praise to be flowering before all the nations
 because of zion i will not keep quiet and because of jerusalem i will take no rest till her righteousness goes out like the shining of the sun and her salvation like a burning light
 and the nations will see your righteousness and all kings your glory and you will have a new name given by the mouth of the lord
 and you will be a fair crown in the hand of the lord and a kings head dress in the hand of your god
 you will not now be named she who is given up and your land will no longer be named the waste land but you will have the name my pleasure is in her and your land will be named married for the lord has pleasure in you and your land will be married
 for as a young man takes a virgin for his wife so will your maker be married to you and as a husband has joy in his bride so will the lord your god be glad over you
 i have put watchmen on your walls o jerusalem they will not keep quiet day or night you who are the lords recorders take no rest
 and give him no rest till he puts jerusalem in her place to be praised in the earth
 the lord has taken an oath by his right hand and by the arm of his strength truly i will no longer give your grain to be food for your haters and men of strange countries will not take the wine for which your work has been done
 but those who have got in the grain will have it for their food and will give praise to the lord and those who have got in the grapes will take the wine of them in the open places of my holy house
 go through go through the doors make ready the way of the people let the highway be lifted up let the stones be taken away let a flag be lifted up over the peoples
 the lord has sent out word to the end of the earth say to the daughter of zion see your saviour comes those whom he has made free are with him and those to whom he has given salvation go before him
 and they will be named the holy people those whose cause has been taken up by the lord and you will be named desired a town not given up
 who is this who comes from edom with blood red robes from bozrah he whose clothing is fair stepping with pride in his great strength i whose glory is in the right strong for salvation
 why is your clothing red and why are your robes like those of one who is crushing the grapes
 i have been crushing the grapes by myself and of the peoples there was no man with me in my wrath and in my passion they were crushed under my feet and my robes are marked with their life blood and all my clothing is red
 for the day of punishment is in my heart and the year for the payment of the price for my people has come
 and i saw that there was no helper and i was wondering that no one gave them support so my arm did the work of salvation and my wrath was my support
 and in my passion the peoples were crushed under my feet and broken in my wrath and i put down their strength to the earth
 i will give news of the mercies of the lord and his great acts even all the things the lord has done for us in his great grace to the house of israel even all he has done for us in his unnumbered mercies
 for he said truly they are my people children who will not be false so he was their saviour out of all their trouble
 it was no sent one or angel but he himself who was their saviour in his love and in his pity he took up their cause and he took them in his arms caring for them all through the years
 but they went against him causing grief to his holy spirit so he was turned against them and made war on them
 then the early days came to their minds the days of moses his servant and they said where is he who made the keeper of his flock come up from the sea where is he who put his holy spirit among them
 he who made the arm of his glory go at the right hand of moses by whom the waters were parted before them to make himself an eternal name
 he who made them go through the deep waters like a horse in the waste land
 like the cattle which go down into the valley they went without falling the spirit of the lord guiding them so you went before your people to make yourself a great name
 let your eyes be looking down from heaven from your holy and beautiful house where is your deep feeling the working of your power do not keep back the moving of your pity and your mercies
 for you are our father though abraham has no knowledge of us and israel gives no thought to us you o lord are our father from the earliest days you have taken up our cause
 o lord why do you send us wandering from your ways making our hearts hard so that we have no fear of you come back because of your servants the tribes of your heritage
 why have evil men gone over your holy place so that it has been crushed under the feet of our haters
 we have become as those who were never ruled by you on whom your name was not named
 o let the heavens be broken open and come down so that the mountains may be shaking before you 
 as when fire puts the brushwood in flames or as when water is boiling from the heat of the fire to make your name feared by your haters so that the nations may be shaking before you
 while you do acts of power for which we are not looking and which have not come to the ears of men in the past
 the ear has not had news of or the eye seen  any god but you working for the man who is waiting for him
 will you not have mercy on him who takes pleasure in doing righteousness even on those who keep in mind your ways truly you were angry and we went on doing evil and sinning against you in the past
 for we have all become like an unclean person and all our good acts are like a dirty robe and we have all become old like a dead leaf and our sins like the wind take us away
 and there is no one who makes prayer to your name or who is moved to keep true to you for your face is veiled from us and you have given us into the power of our sins
 but now o lord you are our father we are the earth and you are our maker and we are all the work of your hand
 be not very angry o lord and do not keep our sins in mind for ever give ear to our prayer for we are all your people
 your holy towns have become a waste zion has become a waste jerusalem is a mass of broken walls
 our holy and beautiful house where our fathers gave praise to you is burned with fire and all the things of our desire have come to destruction
 in view of all this will you still do nothing o lord will you keep quiet and go on increasing our punishment
 i have been ready to give an answer to those who did not make prayer to me i have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me i said here am i here am i to a nation which gave no respect to my name
 all day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people who go in an evil way after the purposes of their hearts
 a people who make me angry every day making offerings in gardens and burning perfumes on bricks
 who are seated in the resting places of the dead and by night are in the secret places who take pigs flesh for food and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels
 who say keep away do not come near me for fear that i make you holy these are a smoke in my nose a fire burning all day
 see it is recorded before me says the lord i will not keep back my hand till i have sent punishment
 for their sins and the sins of their fathers who were burning perfumes on the mountains and saying evil things against me on the hills so i will take the measure of their sins and will send the punishment for them into their breast
 this is the word of the lord as the new wine is seen in the grapes and they say do not send destruction on it for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants in order that i may not put an end to them all
 and i will take a seed out of jacob and out of judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage and the people i have taken to be mine will have it for themselves and my servants will have their resting place there
 and sharon will be a grass land for the flocks and the valley of achor a resting place for the herds for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me
 but as for you who have given up the lord who have no care for my holy mountain who get ready a table for chance and make offerings of mixed wine to fate
 your fate will be the sword and you will all go down to death because when my voice came to you you made no answer you did not give ear to my word but you did what was evil in my eyes desiring what was not pleasing to me
 for this cause says the lord god my servants will have food but you will be in need of food my servants will have drink but you will be dry my servants will have joy but you will be shamed
 my servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts but you will be crying for sorrow and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit
 and your name will become a curse to my people and the lord god will put you to death and give his servants another name
 so that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true god and he who takes an oath will do so by the true god because the past troubles are gone out of mind and because they are covered from my eyes
 for see i am making a new heaven and a new earth and the past things will be gone completely out of mind
 but men will be glad and have joy for ever in what i am making for i am making jerusalem a delight and her people a joy
 and i will be glad over jerusalem and have joy in my people and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her or the voice of grief
 no longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old and he whose life is shorter than a hundred years will seem as one cursed
 and they will be building houses and living in them planting vine gardens and getting the fruit of them
 they will no longer be building for the use of others or planting for others to have the fruit for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of their hands
 their work will not be for nothing and they will not give birth to children for destruction for they are a seed to whom the lord has given his blessing and their offspring will be with them
 and before they make their request i will give an answer and while they are still making prayer to me i will give ear
 the wolf and the lamb will take their food together and the lion will make a meal of grass like the ox but dust will be the snakes food there will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain says the lord
 the lord says heaven is the seat of my power and earth is the resting place for my feet what sort of house will you make for me and what place will be my resting place
 for all these things my hand has made and they are mine says the lord but to this man only will i give attention to him who is poor and broken in spirit fearing my word
 he who puts an ox to death puts a man to death he who makes an offering of a lamb puts a dog to death he who makes a meal offering makes an offering of pigs blood he who makes an offering of perfumes for a sign gives worship to an image as they have gone after their desires and their soul takes pleasure in their disgusting things
 so i will go after trouble for them and will send on them what they are fearing because no one made answer to my voice or gave ear to my word but they did what was evil in my eyes going after that in which i took no pleasure
 give ear to the word of the lord you who are in fear at his word your countrymen hating you and driving you out because of my name have said let the lords glory be made clear so that we may see your joy but they will be put to shame
 there is a noise of war from the town a sound from the temple the voice of the lord giving punishment to his haters
 before her pains came she gave birth before her pains she gave birth to a man child
 when has such a story come to mens ears who has seen such things will a land come to birth in one day will a nation be given birth in a minute for when zions pains came on her she gave birth to her children straight away
 will i by whom the birth was started not make it complete says the lord will i who make children come to birth let them be kept back says your god
 have joy with jerusalem and be glad with her all you her lovers take part in her joy all you who are sorrowing for her
 so that you may take of the comfort flowing from her breasts and be delighted with the full measure of her glory
 for the lord says see i will make her peace like a river and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream and she will take her children in her arms gently caring for them on her knees
 as to one who is comforted by his mother so will i give you comfort and you will be comforted in jerusalem
 and you will see it and your heart will be glad and your bones will get new strength like young grass and the hand of the lord will be seen at work for his servants and his wrath against his haters
 for the lord is coming with fire and his war carriages will be like the storm wind to give punishment in the heat of his wrath and his passion is like flames of fire
 for with fire and sword will the lord come judging all the earth and his sword will be on all flesh and great numbers will be put to death by him
 as for those who keep themselves separate and make themselves clean in the gardens going after one in the middle taking pigs flesh for food and other disgusting things such as the mouse their works and their thoughts will come to an end together says the lord
 and i am coming to get together all nations and tongues and they will come and will see my glory
 and i will put a sign among them and i will send those who are still living to the nations to tarshish put and lud meshech and rosh tubal and javan to the sea lands far away who have not had word of me or seen my glory and they will give the knowledge of my glory to the nations
 and they will take your countrymen out of all the nations for an offering to the lord on horses and in carriages and in carts and on asses and on camels to my holy mountain jerusalem says the lord as the children of israel take their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord
 and some of them will i take for priests and levites says the lord
 for as the new heaven and the new earth which i will make will be for ever before me says the lord so will your seed and your name be for ever
 and it will be that from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath all flesh will come to give worship before me says the lord
 and they will go out to see the dead bodies of the men who have done evil against me for their worm will ever be living and their fire will never be put out and they will be a thing of fear to all flesh
 now it came about in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of aram and pekah the son of remaliah the king of israel came up to jerusalem to make war against it but were not able to overcome it
 and word came to the family of david that aram had put up its tents in ephraim and the kings heart and the hearts of his people were moved like the trees of the wood shaking in the wind
 then the lord said to isaiah go out now you and shear jashub your son and you will come across ahaz at the end of the stream flowing from the higher pool in the highway of the washermans field
 and say to him take care and be quiet have no fear and do not let your heart be feeble because of these two ends of smoking fire wood because of the bitter wrath of rezin and aram and of the son of remaliah
 because aram has made evil designs against you saying
 let us go up against judah troubling her and forcing our way into her and let us put up a king in her even the son of tabeel
 this is the word of the lord god this design will not come about or be effected
 for the head of aram is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin  and in sixty five years from now ephraim will be broken and will no longer be a people 
 and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliahs son if you will not have faith your kingdom will be broken
 and isaiah said again to ahaz
 make a request to the lord your god for a sign a sign in the deep places of the underworld or in the high heavens
 but ahaz said i will not put the lord to the test by making such a request
 and he said give ear now o family of david is it not enough that you are driving men to disgust will you do the same to my god
 for this cause the lord himself will give you a sign a young woman is now with child and she will give birth to a son and she will give him the name immanuel
 butter and honey will be his food when he is old enough to make a decision between evil and good
 for before the child is old enough to make a decision between evil and good the land whose two kings you are now fearing will have become waste
 the lord is about to send on you and on your people and on your fathers house such a time of trouble as there has not been from the days of the separating of ephraim from judah even the coming of the king of assyria
 and it will be in that day that the lord will make a piping sound for the fly which is in the end of the rivers of egypt and for the bee which is in the land of assyria
 and they will come covering all the waste valleys and the holes of the rocks and the thorns and all the watering places
 in that day will the lord take away the hair of the head and of the feet as well as the hair of the face with a blade got for a price from the other side of the river even with the king of assyria
 and it will be in that day that a man will give food to a young cow and two sheep
 and they will give so much milk that he will be able to have butter for his food for butter and honey will be the food of all who are still living in the land
 and it will be in that day that in every place where before there were a thousand vines valued at a thousand shekels of silver there will be nothing but blackberries and thorns
 men will come there with bows and arrows because all the land will be full of blackberries and thorns
 and they will send out the oxen and the sheep on all the hills which before were worked with the spade  fear of blackberries and thorns
 and the lord said to me take a great writing board and on it put down in common letters maher shalal hash baz
 and take true witnesses to the writing uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah
 and i went in to my wife and she became with child and gave birth to a son then the lord said to me give him the name maher shalal hash baz
 for before the child is able to say father or mother the wealth of damascus and the goods of samaria will be taken away by the king of assyria
 and the lord said again to me
 because this people will have nothing to do with the softly flowing waters of shiloah and have fear of rezin and remaliahs son
 for this cause the lord is sending on them the waters of the river deep and strong even the king of assyria and all his glory and it will come up through all its streams overflowing all its edges
 and it will come on into judah rushing on and overflowing till the waters are up to the neck *** and his outstretched wings will be covering the land from side to side for god is with us
 have knowledge o peoples and be in fear give ear all you far off parts of the earth
 let your designs be formed and they will come to nothing give your orders and they will not be effected for god is with us
 for the lord controlling me with a strong hand gave me orders not to go in the way of this people saying
 do not say it is holy about everything of which this people says it is holy and do not be in fear of what they go in fear of
 but let the lord of armies be holy to you and go in fear of him giving honour to him
 and he will be for a holy place but for a stone of falling and a rock of trouble to the two houses of israel and to the men of jerusalem for a net in which they may be taken
 and numbers of them falling on the stone will be broken and will be taken in the net
 let my teaching be kept secret and my words be given to my disciples only
 and i will be waiting for the lord whose face is veiled from the house of jacob and i will be looking for him
 see i and the children whom the lord has given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of armies whose resting place is in mount zion
 and when they say to you make request for us to those who have control of spirits and to those wise in secret arts who make hollow bird like sounds is it not right for a people to make request to their gods to make request for the living to the dead
 then say to them put your faith in the teaching and the witness  if they do not say such things  for him there is no dawn 
 and he will go through the land in bitter trouble and in need of food and when he is unable to get food he will become angry cursing his king and his god and his eyes will be turned to heaven on high
 and he will be looking down on the earth and there will be trouble and dark clouds black night where there is no seeing
 in earlier times he made the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali of small value but after that he gave it glory by the way of the sea on the other side of jordan galilee of the nations
 the people who went in the dark have seen a great light and for those who were living in the land of the deepest night the light is shining
 you have made them very glad increasing their joy they are glad before you as men are glad in the time of getting in the grain or when they make division of the goods taken in war
 for by your hand the yoke on his neck and the rod on his back even the rod of his cruel master have been broken as in the day of midian
 for every boot of the man of war with his sounding step and the clothing rolled in blood will be for burning food for the fire
 for to us a child has come to us a son is given and the government has been placed in his hands and he has been named wise guide strong god father for ever prince of peace
 of the increase of his rule and of peace there will be no end on the seat of david and in his kingdom to make it strong supporting it with wise decision and righteousness now and for ever by the fixed purpose of the lord of armies this will be done
 the lord has sent a word to jacob and it has come on israel
 and all the people will have experience of it even ephraim and the men of samaria who say in the pride of their uplifted hearts
 the bricks have come down but we will put up buildings of cut stone in their place the sycamores are cut down but they will be changed to cedars
 for this cause the lord has made strong the haters of israel driving them on to make war against him
 aram on the east and the philistines on the west who have come against israel with open mouths for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
 but the heart of the people was not turned to him who sent punishment on them and they made no prayer to the lord of armies
 for this cause the lord took away from israel head and tail high and low in one day
 the man who is honoured and responsible is the head and the prophet who gives false teaching is the tail
 for the guides of this people are the cause of their wandering from the right way and those who are guided by them come to destruction
 for this cause the lord will have no pleasure in their young men and no pity on their widows and the children without fathers for they are all haters of god and evil doers and foolish words come from every mouth for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
 for evil was burning like a fire the blackberries and thorns were burned up the thick woods took fire rolling up in dark clouds of smoke
 the land was dark with the wrath of the lord of armies the people were like those who take mens flesh for food
 on the right a man was cutting off bits and was still in need on the left a man took a meal but had not enough no man had pity on his brother every man was making a meal of the flesh of his neighbour
 manasseh was making a meal of ephraim and ephraim of manasseh and together they were attacking judah for all this his wrath is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still
 the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests who were in anathoth in the land of benjamin
 to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his rule
 and it came again in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah up to the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah till jerusalem was taken away in the fifth month
 now the word of the lord came to me saying
 before you were formed in the body of your mother i had knowledge of you and before your birth i made you holy i have given you the work of being a prophet to the nations
 then said i o lord god  see i have no power of words for i am a child
 but the lord said to me do not say i am a child for wherever i send you you are to go and whatever i give you orders to say you are to say
 have no fear because of them for i am with you to keep you safe says the lord
 then the lord put out his hand touching my mouth and the lord said to me see i have put my words in your mouth
 see this day i have put you over the nations and over the kingdoms for uprooting and smashing down for destruction and overturning for building up and planting
 again the word of the lord came to me saying jeremiah what do you see and i said i see a branch of an almond tree
 then the lord said to me you have seen well for i keep watch over my word to give effect to it
 and the word of the lord came to me a second time saying what do you see and i said i see a boiling pot and its face is from the north
 then the lord said to me out of the north evil will come bursting out on all the people of the land
 for see i will send for all the families of the kingdoms of the north says the lord and they will come everyone placing his high seat at the way into jerusalem and against its walls on every side and against all the towns of judah
 and i will give my decision against them on account of all their evil doing because they have given me up burning perfumes to other gods and worshipping the works of their hands
 so make yourself ready and go and say to them everything i give you orders to say do not be overcome by fear of them or i will send fear on you before them
 for see this day have i made you a walled town and an iron pillar and walls of brass against all the land against the kings of judah against its captains against its priests and against the people of the land
 they will be fighting against you but they will not overcome you for i am with you says the lord to give you salvation
 give ear to the word which the lord says to you o people of israel
 this is what the lord has said do not go in the way of the nations have no fear of the signs of heaven for the nations go in fear of them
 for that which is feared by the people is foolish it is the work of the hands of the workman for a tree is cut down by him out of the woods with his axe
 they make it beautiful with silver and gold they make it strong with nails and hammers so that it may not be moved
 it is like a pillar in a garden of plants and has no voice it has to be lifted for it has no power of walking have no fear of it for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to do any good
 there is no one like you o lord you are great and your name is great in power
 who would not have fear of you o king of the nations for it is your right for among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is no one like you
 but they are together like beasts and foolish the teaching of false gods is wood
 silver hammered into plates is sent from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the gold worker blue and purple is their clothing all the work of expert men
 but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an eternal king when he is angry the earth is shaking with fear and the nations give way before his wrath
 this is what you are to say to them the gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens
 he has made the earth by his power he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out
 at the sound of his voice there is a massing of waters in the heavens and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth he makes the thunder flames for the rain and sends out the wind from his store houses
 then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge every gold worker is put to shame by the image he has made for his metal image is deceit and there is no breath in them
 they are nothing a work of error in the time of their punishment destruction will overtake them
 the heritage of jacob is not like these for the maker of all things is his heritage the lord of armies is his name
 get your goods together and go out of the land o you who are shut up in the walled town
 for the lord has said i will send the people in flight like a stone from the land at this time troubling them so that they will be conscious of it
 sorrow is mine for i am wounded  my wound may not be made well and i said cruel is my disease i may not be free from it
 my tent is pulled down and all my cords are broken my children have gone from me and they are not no longer is there anyone to give help in stretching out my tent and hanging up my curtains
 for the keepers of the sheep have become like beasts not looking to the lord for directions so they have not done wisely and all their flocks have been put to flight
 news is going about see it is coming a great shaking is coming from the north country so that the towns of judah may be made waste and become the living place of jackals
 o lord i am conscious that a mans way is not in himself man has no power of guiding his steps
 o lord put me right but with wise purpose not in your wrath or you will make me small
 let your wrath be let loose on the nations which have no knowledge of you and on the families who give no worship to your name for they have made a meal of jacob truly they have made a meal of him and put an end to him and made his fields a waste
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 give ear to the words of this agreement and say to the men of judah and to the people of jerusalem
 the lord the god of israel has said let that man be cursed who does not give ear to the words of this agreement
 to the order which i gave your fathers on the day when i took them out of the land of egypt out of the oven of iron saying give ear to my voice and do all the orders i have given you so you will be my people and i will be your god
 so that i may give effect to the oath which i made to your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as at this day and i said in answer so be it o lord
 and the lord said to me give out these words in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying give ear to the words of this agreement and do them
 for i gave certain witness to your fathers on the day when i took them up out of the land of egypt and even to this day getting up early and witnessing and saying give ear to my voice
 but they gave no attention and did not give ear but they went on every man in the pride of his evil heart so i sent on them all the curses in this agreement which i gave them orders to keep but they did not
 and the lord said to me there is an evil design at work among the men of judah and the people of jerusalem
 they are turned back to the sins of their fathers who would not give ear to my words they have gone after other gods and become their servants the people of israel and the people of judah have not kept the agreement which i made with their fathers
 so the lord has said i will send evil on them which they will not be able to get away from and they will send up a cry for help to me but i will not give ear to them
 then the towns of judah and the people of jerusalem will go crying for help to the gods to whom they have been burning perfumes but they will give them no salvation in the time of their trouble
 for the number of your gods is as the number of your towns o judah and for every street in jerusalem you have put up altars to the baal for burning perfumes to the baal
 and as for you make no prayers for this people send up no cry or prayer for them for i will not give ear to their cry in the time of their trouble
 about judah what have you to do in my house is it your thought that oaths and holy flesh will get you out of your trouble will you make yourself safe in this way
 you had been named by the lord a branching olive tree fair with beautiful fruit with the noise of a great rushing he has put it on fire and its branches are broken
 for the lord of armies by whom you were planted has given his decision for evil against you because of the evil which the people of israel and the people of judah have done in moving me to wrath by offering perfumes to the baal
 and the lord gave me knowledge of it and i saw it then you made clear to me their doings
 but i was like a gentle lamb taken to be put to death i had no thought that they were designing evil against me saying come and let us make trouble his food cutting him off from the land of the living so that there may be no more memory of his name
 but o lord of armies judging in righteousness testing the thoughts and the heart let me see your punishment come on them for i have put my cause before you
 so this is what the lord of armies has said about the men of anathoth who have made designs against your life saying you are not to be a prophet in the name of the lord or death will overtake you by our hands
 so the lord of armies has said see i will send punishment on them the young men will be put to the sword their sons and their daughters will come to death through need of food
 not one of them will keep his life for i will send evil on the men of anathoth in the year of their punishment
 you are in the right o lord when i put my cause before you still let me take up with you the question of your decisions why does the evil doer do well why are the workers of deceit living in comfort
 they have been planted by you they have taken root they go on and give fruit you are near in their mouths but far from their thoughts
 but you o lord have knowledge of me you see me searching and testing how my heart is with you let them be pulled out like sheep to be put to death make them ready for the day of death
 how long will the land have grief and the plants of all the land be dry because of the sins of the people living in it destruction has overtaken the beasts and the birds because they said god does not see our ways
 if running with the fighting men has made you tired how will you be able to keep up with horses and if in a land of peace you go in flight what will become of you in the thick growth of jordan
 for even your brothers your fathers family even they have been untrue to you crying loudly after you have no faith in them though they say fair words to you
 i have given up my house i have let my heritage go i have given the loved one of my soul into the hands of her haters
 my heritage has become like a lion in the woodland to me her voice has been loud against me so i have hate for her
 my heritage is like a brightly coloured bird to me the cruel birds are attacking her on every side go get together all the beasts of the field make them come for destruction
 the keepers of sheep have been the destruction of my vine garden crushing my heritage under their feet they have made my fair heritage an unplanted waste
 they have made it waste it is weeping to me being wasted all the land is made waste because no man takes it to heart
 those who make waste have come on all the open hilltops in the waste land for the sword of the lord sends destruction from one end of the land to the other end of the land no flesh has peace
 though good grain was planted they have got in thorns they have given themselves pain without profit they will be shamed on account of their produce because of the burning wrath of the lord
 this is what the lord has said against all my evil neighbours who put their hands on the heritage which i gave my people israel see i will have them uprooted from their land uprooting the people of judah from among them
 and it will come about that after they have been uprooted i will again have pity on them and i will take them back every man to his heritage and every man to his land
 and it will be that if they give their minds to learning the ways of my people using my name in their oaths by the living lord as they have been teaching my people to take oaths by the baal then their place will be made certain among my people
 but if they will not give ear then i will have that nation uprooted and given to destruction says the lord
 this is what the lord said to me go and get yourself a linen band and put it round you and do not put it in water
 so as the lord said i got a band for a price and put it round my body
 and the word of the lord came to me a second time saying
 take the band which you got for a price which is round your body and go to parah and put it in a secret place there in a hole of the rock
 so i went and put it in a secret place by parah as the lord had said to me
 then after a long time the lord said to me up  go to parah and get the band which i gave you orders to put there
 so i went to parah and uncovering the hole took the band from the place where i had put it away and the band was damaged and of no use for anything
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 the lord has said in this way i will do damage to the pride of judah and to the great pride of jerusalem
 these evil people who say they will not give ear to my words who go on in the pride of their hearts and have become servants and worshippers of other gods will become like this band which is of no use for anything
 for as a band goes tightly round a mans body so i made all the people of israel and all the people of judah tightly united to me so that they might be a people for me and a name and a praise and a glory but they would not give ear
 so you are to say this word to them this is the word of the lord the god of israel every skin bottle will be full of wine and they will say to you is it not quite clear to us that every skin bottle will be full of wine
 then you are to say to them the lord has said i will make all the people of this land even the kings seated on davids seat and the priests and the prophets and all the people of jerusalem overcome with strong drink
 i will have them smashed against one another fathers and sons together says the lord i will have no pity or mercy i will have no feeling for them to keep me from giving them to destruction
 give ear and let your ears be open be not lifted up for these are the words of the lord
 give glory to the lord your god before he makes it dark and before your feet are slipping on the dark mountains and while you are looking for a light he makes it into deep dark into black night
 but if you do not give ear to it my soul will be weeping in secret for your pride my eye will be weeping bitterly streaming with water because the lords flock has been taken away as prisoners
 say to the king and to the queen mother make yourselves low be seated on the earth for the crown of your glory has come down from your heads
 the towns of the south are shut up and there is no one to make them open judah is taken away as prisoners all judah is taken away as prisoners
 let your eyes be lifted up  o jerusalem  and see those who are coming from the north where is the flock which was given to you your beautiful flock
 what will you say when he puts over you those whom you yourself have made your friends will not pains take you like a woman in childbirth
 and if you say in your heart why have these things come on me because of the number of your sins your skirts have been uncovered and violent punishment overtakes you
 is it possible for the skin of the ethiopian to be changed or the markings on the leopard then it might be possible for you to do good who have been trained to do evil
 so i will send them in all directions as dry grass is taken away by the wind of the waste land
 this is your fate the part measured out to you by me says the lord because you have put me out of your memory and put your faith in what is false
 so i will have your skirts uncovered before your face in order that your shame may be seen
 i have seen your disgusting acts even your false behaviour and your cries of desire and your loose ways on the hills in the field unhappy are you o jerusalem you have no desire to be made clean how long will you be in turning back to me
 the word of the lord came to jeremiah when there was no water
 judah is weeping and its doors are dark with sorrow and people are seated on the earth clothed in black and the cry of jerusalem has gone up
 their great men have sent their servants for water they come to the holes and there is no water to be seen they come back with nothing in their vessels they are overcome with shame and fear covering their heads
 those who do work on the land are in fear for there has been no rain on the land and the farmers are shamed covering their heads
 and the roe giving birth in the field lets her young one be uncared for because there is no grass
 and the asses of the field on the open hilltops are opening their mouths wide like jackals to get air their eyes are hollow because there is no grass
 though our sins give witness against us do something o lord for the honour of your name for again and again we have been turned away from you we have done evil against you
 o you hope of israel its saviour in time of trouble why are you like one who is strange in the land and like a traveller putting up his tent for a night
 why are you like a man surprised like a man of war who is not able to give help but you o lord are with us and we are named by your name do not go away from us
 this is what the lord has said about this people even so they have been glad to go from the right way they have not kept their feet from wandering so the lord has no pleasure in them now he will keep their wrongdoing in mind and send punishment for their sins
 and the lord said to me make no prayer for this people for their good
 when they go without food i will not give ear to their cry when they give burned offerings and meal offerings i will not take pleasure in them but i will put an end to them by the sword and by need of food and by disease
 then i said ah lord god  see the prophets say to them you will not see the sword or be short of food but i will give you certain peace in this place
 then the lord said to me the prophets say false words in my name and i gave them no orders and i said nothing to them what they say to you is a false vision and wonder working words without substance the deceit of their hearts
 so this is what the lord has said about the prophets who make use of my name though i sent them not and say the sword and need of food will not be in this land the sword and need of food will put an end to those prophets
 and the people to whom they are prophets will be pushed out dead into the streets of jerusalem because there is no food and because of the sword and they will have no one to put their bodies into the earth them or their wives or their sons or their daughters for i will let loose their evil doing on them
 and you are to say this word to them let my eyes be streaming with water night and day and let it not be stopped for the virgin daughter of my people is wounded with a great wound with a very bitter blow
 if i go out into the open country there are those put to death by the sword  and if i go into the town there are those who are diseased from need of food  for the prophet and the priest go about in the land and have no knowledge
 have you completely given up judah is your soul turned in disgust from zion why have you given us blows from which there is no one to make us well we were looking for peace but no good came and for a time of well being but there was only a great fear
 we are conscious o lord of our sin and of the wrongdoing of our fathers we have done evil against you
 do not be turned from us in disgust because of your name do not put shame on the seat of your glory keep us in mind let not your agreement with us be broken
 are any of the false gods of the nations able to make rain come are the heavens able to give showers are you not he o lord our god so we will go on waiting for you for you have done all these things
 then the lord said to me even if moses and samuel came before me i would have no desire for this people send them away from before me and let them go
 and it will be when they say to you where are we to go then you are to say to them the lord has said such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are to be in need of food to need of food and such as are to be taken away prisoners to be taken away
 and i will put over them four divisions says the lord the sword causing death dogs pulling the dead bodies about and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth to take their bodies for food and put an end to them
 and i will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah and what he did in jerusalem
 for who will have pity on you o jerusalem and who will have sorrow for you or who will go out of his way to see how you are
 you have given me up says the lord you have gone back so my hand is stretched out against you for your destruction i am tired of changing my purpose
 and i have sent a cleaning wind on them in the public places of the land i have taken their children from them i have given my people to destruction they have not been turned from their ways
 i have let their widows be increased in number more than the sand of the seas i have sent against them against the mother and the young men one who makes waste in the heat of the day causing pain and fears to come on her suddenly
 the mother of seven is without strength her spirit is gone from her her sun has gone down while it is still day she has been shamed and overcome and the rest of them i will give up to the sword before their haters says the lord
 sorrow is mine my mother because you have given birth to me a cause of fighting and argument in all the earth  i have not made men my creditors and i am not in debt to any but every one of them is cursing me
 
 is it possible for iron to be broken even iron from the north and brass
 i will give your wealth and your stores to your attackers without a price because of all your sins even in every part of your land
 they will go away with your haters into a land which is strange to you for my wrath is on fire with a flame which will be burning on you
 o lord you have knowledge keep me in mind and come to my help and give their right reward to those who are attacking me take me not away for you are slow to be angry see how i have undergone shame because of you from all those who make little of your word
 but to me your word is a joy making my heart glad for i am named by your name o lord god of armies
 i did not take my seat among the band of those who are glad and i had no joy i kept by myself because of your hand for you have made me full of wrath
 why is my pain unending and my wound without hope of being made well sorrow is mine for you are to me as a stream offering false hope and as waters which are not certain
 for this cause the lord has said if you will come back then i will again let you take your place before me and if you give out what is of value and not that which has no value you will be as my mouth let them come back to you but do not go back to them
 and i will make you a strong wall of brass to this people they will be fighting against you but they will not overcome you for i am with you to keep you safe says the lord
 i will keep you safe from the hands of the evil doers and i will give you salvation from the hands of the cruel ones
 then again the word of the lord came to me saying
 you are not to take a wife for yourself or have sons or daughters in this place
 for this is what the lord has said about the sons and daughters who come to birth in this place and about their mothers who have given them birth and about their fathers who have given life to them in this land
 death from evil diseases will overtake them there will be no weeping for them and their bodies will not be put to rest they will be like waste on the face of the earth the sword and need of food will put an end to them their dead bodies will be meat for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth
 for this is what the lord has said do not go into the house of sorrow do not go to make weeping or songs of grief for them for i have taken away my peace from this people says the lord even mercy and pity
 death will overtake great as well as small in the land their bodies will not be put in a resting place and no one will be weeping for them or wounding themselves or cutting off their hair for them
 no one will make a feast for them in sorrow to give them comfort for the dead or put to their lips the cup of comfort on account of their father or their mother
 and you are not to go into the house of feasting or be seated with them to take food or drink
 for the lord of armies the god of israel has said see before your eyes and in your days i will put an end in this place to the laughing voices and the voice of joy to the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride
 and it will be that when you say all these words to the people then they will say to you why has the lord done all this evil against us what is our wrongdoing and what is our sin which we have done against the lord our god
 then you will say to them because your fathers have given me up says the lord and have gone after other gods and become their servants and their worshippers and have given me up and have not kept my law
 and you have done worse evil than your fathers for see every one of you is guided by the pride of his evil heart so as not to give ear to me
 for this reason i will send you away out of this land into a land which is strange to you to you and to your fathers there you will be the servants of other gods day and night and you will have no mercy from me
 for this cause see the days are coming says the lord when it will no longer be said by the living lord who took the children of israel up out of the land of egypt
 but by the living lord who took the children of israel up out of the land of the north and from all the countries where he had sent them and i will take them back again to their land which i gave to their fathers
 see i will send for great numbers of fishermen says the lord and they will take them like fish in a net and after that i will send for numbers of bowmen and they will go after them driving them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks
 for my eyes are on all their ways there is no cover for them from my face and their evil doing is not kept secret from my eyes
 and i will give them the reward of their evil doing and their sin twice over because they have made my land unclean and have made my heritage full of the bodies of their unholy and disgusting things
 o lord my strength and my strong tower my safe place in the day of trouble the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say the heritage of our fathers is nothing but deceit even false things in which there is no profit
 will a man make for himself gods which are no gods
 for this reason truly i will make them see this once i will give them knowledge of my hand and my power and they will be certain that my name is the lord
 the sin of judah is recorded with a pen of iron and with the sharp point of a jewel it is cut on their hearts of stone and on the horns of their altars for a sign to them
 their altars and their wood pillars under every branching tree on the high hills and the mountains in the field
 i will give your wealth and all your stores to be taken away in war without a price because of your sins in every part of your land
 and your hand will have to let go your heritage which i gave you and i will make you a servant to your haters in a land which is strange to you for you have put my wrath on fire with a flame which will go on burning for ever
 this is what the lord has said cursed is the man who puts his faith in man and makes flesh his arm and whose heart is turned away from the lord
 for he will be like the brushwood in the upland and will not see when good comes but his living place will be in the dry places in the waste land in a salt and unpeopled land
 a blessing is on the man who puts his faith in the lord and whose hope the lord is
 for he will be like a tree planted by the waters pushing out its roots by the stream he will have no fear when the heat comes but his leaf will be green in a dry year he will have no care and will go on giving fruit
 the heart is a twisted thing not to be searched out by man who is able to have knowledge of it
 i the lord am the searcher of the heart the tester of the thoughts so that i may give to every man the reward of his ways in keeping with the fruit of his doings
 like the partridge getting eggs together but not producing young is a man who gets wealth but not by right before half his days are ended it will go from him and at his end he will be foolish
 a seat of glory placed on high from the first is our holy place
 o lord the hope of israel all who give you up will be put to shame those who go away from you will be cut off from the earth because they have given up the lord the fountain of living waters
 make me well o lord and i will be well be my saviour and i will be safe for you are my hope
 see they say to me where is the word of the lord let it come now
 as for me i have not said let the day of trouble come to them quickly and i have not been hoping for the death giving day you have knowledge of what came from my lips it was open before you
 be not a cause of fear to me you are my safe place in the day of evil
 let them be put to shame who are attacking me but let me not be shamed let them be overcome with fear but let me not be overcome send on them the day of evil and put them to destruction twice over
 this is what the lord has said to me go and take your place in the doorway of benjamin where the kings of judah come in and by which they go out and in all the doorways of jerusalem
 and say to them give ear to the word of the lord you kings of judah and all the people of jerusalem who come in by these doors
 this is what the lord has said see to yourselves that you take up no weight on the sabbath day or take it in through the doors of jerusalem
 and take no weight out of your houses on the sabbath day or do any work but keep the sabbath day holy as i gave orders to your fathers
 but they gave no attention and would not give ear but they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear and might not get teaching
 and it will be that if with all care you give ear to me says the lord and take no weight through the doorways of this town on the sabbath day but keep the sabbath day holy and do no work in it
 then through the doors of this town there will come kings and princes seated on the seat of david going in carriages and on horseback they and their princes and the men of judah and the people of jerusalem and this town will keep its place for ever
 and they will come from the towns of judah and from the places round about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the lowlands and from the mountains and from the south with burned offerings and offerings of beasts and meal offerings and perfume and offerings of praise to the house of the lord
 but if you do not give ear to me to keep the sabbath day holy and to let no weight be lifted and taken through the doors of jerusalem on the sabbath day then i will put a fire in its doorways burning up the great houses of jerusalem and it will never be put out
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 up  go down to the potters house and there i will let my words come to your ears
 then i went down to the potters house and he was doing his work on the stones
 and when the vessel which he was forming out of earth got damaged in the hand of the potter he made it again into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to make it
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 o israel am i not able to do with you as this potter does says the lord see like earth in the potters hand are you in my hands o israel
 whenever i say anything about uprooting a nation or a kingdom and smashing it and sending destruction on it
 if in that very minute that nation of which i was talking is turned away from its evil my purpose of doing evil to them will be changed
 and whenever i say anything about building up a nation or a kingdom and planting it
 if in that very minute it does evil in my eyes going against my orders then my good purpose which i said i would do for them will be changed
 now then say to the men of judah and to the people of jerusalem this is what the lord has said see i am forming an evil thing against you and designing a design against you let every man come back now from his evil way and let your ways and your doings be changed for the better
 but they will say there is no hope we will go on in our designs and every one of us will do what he is moved by the pride of his evil heart to do
 so this is what the lord has said make search among the nations and see who has had word of such things the virgin of israel has done a very shocking thing
 will the white snow go away from the top of sirion will the cold waters flowing from the mountains become dry
 for my people have put me out of their memory burning perfumes to that which is nothing and because of this i will put a cause of falling in their ways even in the old roads and will make them go on side roads in a way not lifted up
 making their land a thing of wonder causing sounds of surprise for ever everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder shaking his head
 i will send them in flight as from an east wind before the attacker i will let them see my back and not my face on the day of their downfall
 then they said come let us make a design against jeremiah for teaching will never be cut off from the priest or wisdom from the wise or the word from the prophet come let us make use of his words for an attack on him and let us give attention with care to what he says
 give thought to me o lord and give ear to the voice of those who put forward a cause against me
 is evil to be the reward of good for they have made a deep hole for my soul keep in mind how i took my place before you to say a good word for them so that your wrath might be turned away from them
 for this cause let their children be without food and give them over to the power of the sword and let their wives be without children and become widows let their men be overtaken by death and their young men be put to the sword in the fight
 let a cry for help go up from their houses when you send an armed band on them suddenly for they have made a hole in which to take me and have put nets for my feet secretly
 but you lord have knowledge of all the designs which they have made against my life let not their evil doing be covered or their sin be washed away from before your eyes but let it be a cause of falling before you so do to them in the time of your wrath
 this is what the lord has said go and get for money a potters bottle made of earth and take with you some of the responsible men of the people and of the priests
 and go out to the valley of the son of hinnom by the way into the door of broken pots and there say in a loud voice the words which i will give you
 say give ear to the word of the lord o kings of judah and people of jerusalem the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send evil on this place which will be bitter to the ears of anyone hearing of it
 because they have given me up and made this place a strange place burning perfumes in it to other gods of whom they and their fathers and the kings of judah had no knowledge and they have made this place full of the blood of those who have done no wrong
 and they have put up the high places of the baal burning their sons in the fire a thing which was not ordered by me and it was never in my mind
 for this cause see a time is coming says the lord when this place will no longer be named topheth or the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of death
 i will make the purpose of judah and jerusalem come to nothing in this place i will have them put to the sword by their haters and by the hands of those who have designs on their life and their dead bodies i will give to be food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth
 and i will make this town a thing of wonder and a cause of surprise everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of surprise because of all its troubles
 i will make them take the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters for food they will be making a meal of one another because of their bitter need and the cruel grip of their haters and those who have made designs against their life
 then let the potters bottle be broken before the eyes of the men who have gone with you
 and say to them this is what the lord of armies has said even so will this people and this town be broken by me as a potters bottle is broken and may not be put together again and the bodies of the dead will be put in the earth in topheth till there is no more room
 this is what i will do to this place says the lord and to its people making this town like topheth
 and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah which they have made unclean will be like the place of topheth even all the houses on whose roofs perfumes have been burned to all the army of heaven and drink offerings drained out to other gods
 then jeremiah came from topheth where the lord had sent him to give the prophets word and he took his place in the open square of the lords house and said to all the people
 the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send on this town and on all her towns all the evil which i have said because they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear to my words
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 go and say in the ears of jerusalem the lord says i still keep the memory of your kind heart when you were young and your love when you became my bride how you went after me in the waste of sand in an unplanted land
 israel was holy to the lord the first fruits of his increase all who made attacks on him were judged as wrongdoers evil came on them says the lord
 give ear to the words of the lord o sons of jacob and all the families of israel
 these are the words of the lord what evil have your fathers seen in me that they have gone far from me and walking after what is false have become false
 and they never said where is the lord who took us up out of the land of egypt who was our guide through the waste of sand through an unplanted land full of deep holes through a dry land of deep shade which no one went through and where no man was living
 and i took you into a fertile land where you were living on its fruit and its wealth but when you came in you made my land unclean and made my heritage a disgusting thing
 the priests did not say where is the lord and those who were expert in the law had no knowledge of me and the rulers did evil against me and the prophets became prophets of the baal going after things without value
 for this reason i will again put forward my cause against you says the lord even against you and against your childrens children
 for go over to the sea lands of kittim and see send to kedar and give deep thought to it and see if there has ever been such a thing
 has any nation ever made a change in their gods though they are no gods but my people have given up their glory in exchange for what is of no profit
 be full of wonder o heavens at this be overcome with fear be completely waste says the lord
 for my people have done two evils they have given up me the fountain of living waters and have made for themselves water holes cut out from the rock broken water holes of no use for storing water
 is israel a servant has he been a house servant from birth why has he been made waste
 the young lions have made an outcry against him with a loud voice they have made his land waste his towns are burned up with no one living in them
 even the children of noph and tahpanhes have put shame on you
 has not this come on you because you have given up the lord your god who was your guide by the way
 and now what have you to do on the way to egypt to get your drink from the waters of the nile or what have you to do on the way to assyria to get your drink from the waters of the river
 the evil you yourselves have done will be your punishment your errors will be your judge be certain then and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing to give up the lord your god and no longer to be moved by fear of me says the lord the lord of armies
 for in the past your yoke was broken by your hands and your cords parted and you said i will not be your servant for on every high hill and under every branching tree your behaviour was like that of a loose woman
 but when you were planted by me you were a noble vine in every way a true seed how then have you been changed into the branching plant of a strange vine
 for even if you are washed with soda and take much soap still your evil doing is marked before me says the lord god
 how are you able to say i am not unclean i have not gone after the baals see your way in the valley be clear about what you have done you are a quick footed camel twisting her way in and out
 an untrained ass used to the waste land breathing up the wind in her desire at her time who is able to send her away all those who are looking for her will have no need to make themselves tired in her month they will get her
 do not let your foot be without shoes or your throat dry from need of water but you said there is no hope no for i have been a lover of strange gods and after them i will go
 as the thief is shamed when he is taken so is israel shamed they their kings and their rulers their priests and their prophets
 who say to a tree you are my father and to a stone you have given me life for their backs have been turned to me not their faces but in the time of their trouble they will say up  and be our saviour
 but where are the gods you have made for yourselves let them come if they are able to give you salvation in the time of your trouble for the number of your gods is as the number of your towns o judah
 why will you put forward your cause against me you have all done evil against me says the lord
 i gave your children blows to no purpose they got no good from training your sword has been the destruction of your prophets like a death giving lion
 o generation see the word of the lord have i been a waste land to israel or a land of dark night why do my people say we have got loose we will not come to you again
 is it possible for a virgin to put out of her memory her ornaments or a bride her robes but my people have put me out of their memories for unnumbered days
 with what care are your ways ordered when you are looking for love  so  your ways
 and in the skirts of your robe may be seen the life blood of those who have done no wrong 
 and still you said i have done no wrong truly his wrath is turned away from me see i will take up the cause against you because you say i have done no wrong
 why do you go about so much for the purpose of changing your way you will be shamed on account of egypt as you were shamed on account of assyria
 truly you will go out from him with your hands on your head for the lord has given up those in whom you have put your faith and they will be of no help to you
 now it came to the ears of pashhur the son of immer the priest who was chief in authority in the house of the lord that jeremiah was saying these things
 and pashhur gave blows to jeremiah and had his feet chained in a framework of wood in the higher doorway of benjamin which was in the house of the lord
 then on the day after pashhur let jeremiah loose then jeremiah said to him the lord has given you the name of magor missabib  cause of fear on every side  not pashhur
 for the lord has said see i will make you a cause of fear to yourself and to all your friends they will come to their death by the sword of their haters and your eyes will see it and i will give all judah into the hands of the king of babylon and he will take them away prisoners into babylon and put them to the sword
 and more than this i will give all the wealth of this town and all its profits and all its things of value even all the stores of the kings of judah will i give into the hands of their haters who will put violent hands on them and take them away to babylon
 and you pashhur and all who are in your house will go away prisoners you will come to babylon and there your body will be put to rest you and all your friends to whom you said false words
 o lord you have been false to me and i was tricked you are stronger than i and have overcome me i have become a thing to be laughed at all the day everyone makes sport of me
 for every word i say is a cry for help i say with a loud voice violent behaviour and wasting because the word of the lord is made a shame to me and a cause of laughing all the day
 and if i say i will not keep him in mind i will not say another word in his name then it is in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones and i am tired of keeping myself in i am not able to do it
 for numbers of them say evil secretly in my hearing  there is fear on every side  they say come let us give witness against him all my nearest friends who are watching for my fall say it may be that he will be taken by deceit and we will get the better of him and give him punishment
 but the lord is with me as a great one greatly to be feared so my attackers will have a fall and they will not overcome me they will be greatly shamed because they have not done wisely even with an unending shame kept in memory for ever
 but o lord of armies testing the upright and seeing the thoughts and the heart let me see your punishment come on them for i have put my cause before you
 make melody to the lord give praise to the lord for he has made the soul of the poor man free from the hands of the evil doers
 a curse on the day of my birth let there be no blessing on the day when my mother had me
 a curse on the man who gave the news to my father saying you have a male child making him very glad
 may that man be like the towns overturned by the lord without mercy let a cry for help come to his ears in the morning and the sound of war in the middle of the day
 because he did not put me to death before my birth took place so my mothers body would have been my last resting place and she would have been with child for ever
 why did i come from my mothers body to see pain and sorrow so that my days might be wasted with shame
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent to him pashhur the son of malchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying
 will you get directions from the lord for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon is making war against us it may be that the lord will do something for us like all the wonders he has done and make him go away from us
 then jeremiah said to them this is what you are to say to zedekiah
 the lord god of israel has said see i am turning back the instruments of war in your hands with which you are fighting against the king of babylon and the chaldaeans who are outside the walls and shutting you in and i will get them together inside this town
 and i myself will be fighting against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even with angry feeling and passion and in great wrath
 and i will send a great disease on the people living in this town on man and on beast causing their death
 and after that says the lord i will give up zedekiah king of judah and his servants and his people even those in the town who have not come to their end from the disease and the sword and from need of food into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those desiring their death he will put them to the sword he will not let anyone get away he will have no pity or mercy
 and to this people you are to say the lord has said see i put before you the way of life and the way of death
 he who keeps in this town will come to his death by the sword and through need of food and through disease but he who goes out and gives himself up to the chaldaeans who are shutting you in will go on living and will keep his life safe
 for my face is turned to this town for evil and not for good says the lord it will be given into the hands of the king of babylon and he will have it burned with fire
 about the family of the king of judah give ear to the word of the lord
 o family of david this is what the lord has said do what is right in the morning and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away or my wrath will go out like fire burning so that no one may put it out because of the evil of your doings
 see i am against you you who are living on the rock of the valley says the lord you who say who will come down against us or who will get into our houses
 i will send punishment on you in keeping with the fruit of your doings says the lord and i will put a fire in her woodlands burning up everything round about her
 this is what the lord has said go down to the house of the king of judah and there give him this word
 and say give ear to the word of the lord o king of judah seated on the seat of david you and your servants and your people who come in by these doors
 this is what the lord has said do what is right judging uprightly and make free from the hands of the cruel one him whose goods have been violently taken away do no wrong and be not violent to the man from a strange country and the child without a father and the widow and let not those who have done no wrong be put to death in this place
 for if you truly do this then there will come in through the doors of this house kings seated on the seat of david going in carriages and on horseback he and his servants and his people
 but if you do not give ear to these words i give you my oath by myself says the lord that this house will become a waste
 for this is what the lord has said about the family of the king of judah you are gilead to me and the top of lebanon but truly i will make you waste with towns unpeopled
 and i will make ready those who will send destruction on you everyone armed for war by them your best cedar trees will be cut down and put in the fire
 and nations from all sides will go past this town and every man will say to his neighbour why has the lord done such things to this great town
 and they will say because they gave up the agreement of the lord their god and became worshippers and servants of other gods
 let there be no weeping for the dead and make no songs of grief for him but make bitter weeping for him who has gone away for he will never come back or see again the country of his birth
 for this is what the lord has said about shallum the son of josiah king of judah who became king in place of josiah his father who went out from this place he will never come back there again
 but death will come to him in the place where they have taken him away prisoner and he will never see this land again
 a curse is on him who is building his house by wrongdoing and his rooms by doing what is not right who makes use of his neighbour without payment and gives him nothing for his work
 who says i will make a wide house for myself and rooms of great size and has windows cut out and has it roofed with cedar and painted with bright red
 are you to be a king because you make more use of cedar than your father did not your father take food and drink and do right judging in righteousness and then it was well for him
 he was judge in the cause of the poor and those in need then it was well was not this to have knowledge of me says the lord
 but your eyes and your heart are fixed only on profit for yourself on causing the death of him who has done no wrong and on violent and cruel acts
 so this is what the lord has said about jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they will make no weeping for him saying ah my brother  or ah sister  they will make no weeping for him saying ah lord  or ah his glory 
 they will do to him what they do to the dead body of an ass his body will be pulled out and placed on the earth outside the doors of jerusalem
 go up to lebanon and give a cry let your voice be loud in bashan crying out from abarim for all your lovers have come to destruction
 my word came to you in the time of your well being but you said i will not give ear this has been your way from your earliest years you did not give attention to my voice
 all the keepers of your sheep will be food for the wind and your lovers will be taken away prisoners truly then you will be shamed and unhonoured because of all your evil doing
 o you who are living in lebanon making your living place in the cedars how greatly to be pitied will you be when pains come on you as on a woman in childbirth 
 by my life says the lord even if coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah was the ring on my right hand even from there i would have you pulled off
 and i will give you into the hands of those desiring your death and into the hands of those whom you are fearing even into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hands of the chaldaeans
 i will send you out and your mother who gave you birth into another country not the land of your birth and there death will come to you
 but to the land on which their souls desire is fixed they will never come back
 is this man coniah a broken vessel of no value is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure why are they violently sent out he and his seed into a land which is strange to them
 o earth earth earth give ear to the word of the lord 
 the lord has said let this man be recorded as having no children a man who will not do well in all his life for no man of his seed will do well seated on the seat of the kingdom of david and ruling again in judah
 a curse is on the keepers who are causing the destruction and loss of the sheep of my field says the lord
 so this is what the lord the god of israel has said against the keepers who have the care of my people you have let my flock be broken up driving them away and not caring for them see i will send on you the punishment for the evil of your doings says the lord
 and i will get the rest of my flock together from all the countries where i have sent them and will make them come back again to their resting place and they will have offspring and be increased
 and i will put over them keepers who will take care of them never again will they be overcome with fear or be troubled and there will not be the loss of one of them says the lord
 see the days are coming says the lord when i will give to david a true branch and he will be ruling as king acting wisely doing what is right and judging uprightly in the land
 in his days judah will have salvation and israel will be living without fear and this is the name by which he will be named the lord is our righteousness
 and so truly the days are coming when they will say no longer by the living lord who took the children of israel up out of the land of egypt
 but by the living lord who took up the seed of israel and made them come out of the north country and from all the countries where i had sent them and they will be living in the land which is theirs
 about the prophets my heart is broken in me all my bones are shaking i am like a man full of strong drink like a man overcome by wine because of the lord and because of his holy words
 for the land is full of men who are untrue to their wives because of the curse the land is full of grief the green fields of the waste land have become dry and they are quick to do evil their strength is for what is not right
 for the prophet as well as the priest is unclean even in my house i have seen their evil doing says the lord
 for this cause their steps will be slipping on their way they will be forced on into the dark and have a fall there for i will send evil on them in the year of their punishment says the lord
 and i have seen ways without sense in the prophets of samaria they became prophets of the baal causing my people israel to go wrong
 and in the prophets of jerusalem i have seen a shocking thing they are untrue to their wives walking in deceit and they make strong the hands of evil doers so that a man may not be turned back from his evil doing they have all become like sodom to me and its people like gomorrah
 so this is what the lord of armies has said about the prophets see i will give them a bitter plant for their food and bitter water for their drink for from the prophets of jerusalem unclean behaviour has gone out into all the land
 this is what the lord of armies has said do not give ear to the words which the prophets say to you they give you teaching of no value it is from themselves that their vision comes and not out of the mouth of the lord
 they keep on saying to those who have no respect for the word of the lord you will have peace and to everyone who goes on his way in the pride of his heart they say no evil will come to you
 for which of them has knowledge of the secret of the lord and has seen him and given ear to his word which of them has taken note of his word and given attention to it
 see the storm wind of the lord even the heat of his wrath has gone out a rolling storm bursting on the heads of the evil doers
 the wrath of the lord will not be turned back till he has done till he has put into effect the purposes of his heart in days to come you will have full knowledge of this
 i did not send these prophets but they went running i said nothing to them but they gave out the prophets word
 but if they had been in my secret then they would have made my people give ear to my words turning them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings
 am i only a god who is near says the lord and not a god at a distance
 in what secret place may a man take cover without my seeing him says the lord is there any place in heaven or earth where i am not says the lord
 my ears have been open to what the prophets have said who say false words in my name saying i have had a dream i have had a dream i have had a dream
 is  my word  in the hearts of the prophets who give out false words even the prophets of the deceit of their hearts
 whose purpose is to take away the memory of my name from my people by their dreams of which every man is talking to his neighbour as their fathers gave up the memory of my name for the baal
 if a prophet has a dream let him give out his dream and he who has my word let him give out my word in good faith what has the dry stem to do with the grain says the lord
 is not my word like fire says the lord and like a hammer smashing the rock to bits
 for this cause i am against the prophets says the lord who take my words every one from his neighbour
 see i am against the prophets says the lord who let their tongues say he has said
 see i am against the prophets of false dreams says the lord who give them out and make my people go out of the way by their deceit and their uncontrolled words but i did not send them or give them orders and they will be of no profit to this people says the lord
 and if this people or the prophet or a priest questioning you says what word of weight is there from the lord then you are to say to them you are the word for i will not be troubled with you any more says the lord
 and as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say a word of weight from the lord  i will send punishment on that man and on his house
 but this is what you are to say every man to his neighbour and every man to his brother what answer has the lord given and what has the lord said
 and you will no longer put people in mind of the word of weight of the lord for every mans word will be a weight on himself for the words of the living god of the lord of armies our god have been twisted by you
 this is what you are to say to the prophet what answer has the lord given to you and what has the lord said
 but if you say the word of weight of the lord this is what the lord has said because you say the weight of the lord and i have sent to you saying you are not to say the weight of the lord
 for this reason truly i will put you completely out of my memory and i will put you and the town which i gave to you and to your fathers away from before my face
 and i will give you a name without honour for ever and unending shame which will never go from the memory of men
 the lord gave me a vision and i saw two baskets full of figs put in front of the temple of the lord after nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had taken prisoner jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the chiefs of judah and the expert workmen and metal workers from jerusalem and had taken them to babylon
 one basket had very good figs like the figs which first come to growth and the other basket had very bad figs so bad that they were of no use for food
 then the lord said to me what do you see jeremiah and i said figs the good figs are very good and the bad very bad and of no use for food they are so bad
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 this is what the lord the god of israel has said like these good figs so in my eyes will be the prisoners of judah whom i have sent from this place into the land of the chaldaeans for their good
 for i will keep my eyes on them for good and i will take them back again to this land building them up and not pulling them down planting them and not uprooting them
 and i will give them a heart to have knowledge of me that i am the lord and they will be my people and i will be their god for they will come back to me with all their heart
 and like the bad figs which are so bad that they are of no use for food so i will give up zedekiah king of judah and his chiefs and the rest of jerusalem who are still in this land and those who are in the land of egypt
 i will give them up to be a cause of fear and of trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth to be a name of shame and common talk and a cutting word and a curse in all the places wherever i will send them wandering
 and i will send the sword and need of food and disease among them till they are all cut off from the land which i gave to them and to their fathers
 the word which came to jeremiah about all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah this was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
 this word jeremiah gave out to all the people of judah and to those living in jerusalem saying
 from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even till this day for twenty three years the word of the lord has been coming to me and i have given it to you getting up early and talking to you but you have not given ear
 and the lord has sent to you all his servants the prophets getting up early and sending them but you have not given attention and your ear has not been open to give hearing
 saying come back now everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and keep your place in the land which the lord has given to you and to your fathers from times long past even for ever
 do not go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship and do not make me angry with the work of your hands causing evil to yourselves
 but you have not given ear to me says the lord so that you have made me angry with the work of your hands causing evil to yourselves
 so this is what the lord of armies has said because you have not given ear to my words
 see i will send and take all the families of the north says the lord and nebuchadrezzar king of babylon my servant and make them come against this land and against its people and against all these nations on every side and i will give them up to complete destruction and make them a cause of fear and surprise and a waste place for ever
 and more than this i will take from them the sound of laughing voices the voice of joy the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride the sound of the stones crushing the grain and the shining of lights
 all this land will be a waste and a cause of wonder and these nations will be the servants of the king of babylon for seventy years
 and it will come about after seventy years are ended that i will send punishment on the king of babylon and on that nation says the lord for their evil doing and on the land of the chaldaeans and i will make it a waste for ever
 and i will make that land undergo everything i have said against it even everything recorded in this book which jeremiah the prophet has said against all the nations
 for a number of nations and great kings will make servants of them even of them and i will give them the reward of their acts even the reward of the work of their hands
 for this is what the lord the god of israel has said to me take the cup of the wine of this wrath from my hand and make all the nations to whom i send you take of it
 and after drinking it they will go rolling from side to side and be off their heads because of the sword which i will send among them
 then i took the cup from the lords hand and gave a drink from it to all the nations to whom the lord sent me
 jerusalem and the towns of judah and their kings and their princes to make them a waste place a cause of fear and surprise and a curse as it is this day
 pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people
 and all the mixed people and all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the philistines and ashkelon and gaza and ekron and the rest of ashdod
 edom and moab and the children of ammon
 and all the kings of tyre and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the lands across the sea
 dedan and tema and buz and all who have the ends of their hair cut
 and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mixed people living in the waste land
 and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes
 and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth
 and you are to say to them this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said take of this cup and be overcome and let it come out again from your lips and from your fall you will never be lifted up again because of the sword which i will send among you
 and it will be if they will not take of the cup in your hand then you are to say to them this is what the lord of armies has said you will certainly take of it
 for see i am starting to send evil on the town which is named by my name and are you to be without any punishment you will not be without punishment for i will send a sword on all people living on the earth says the lord of armies
 so as a prophet give out these words among them and say to them the voice of the lord will be sounding like a lion from on high he will send out his voice from his holy place like the loud voice of a lion against his flock he will give a cry like those who are crushing the grapes against all the people of the earth
 a noise will come even to the end of the earth for the lord has a cause against the nations he will give his decision against all flesh as for the evil doers he will give them to the sword says the lord
 this is what the lord of armies has said see evil is going out from nation to nation and a great storm will come up from the inmost parts of the earth
 and at that day the bodies of those whom the lord has put to death will be seen from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth there will be no weeping for them their bodies will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth they will be like waste on the face of the land
 give cries of grief you keepers of sheep give cries for help rolling yourselves in the dust you chiefs of the flock for the days of your destruction have fully come and i will send you in all directions and your fall will be like that of the males of the flock
 there will be no way of flight for the keepers of sheep no road for the chiefs of the flock to get away safely
 a sound of the cry of the keepers of sheep and the bitter crying of the chiefs of the flock  for the lord has made waste their green fields
 and there is no sound in the fields of peace because of the burning wrath of the lord
 the lion has come out of his secret place for the land has become a waste because of the cruel sword and because of the heat of his wrath
 when jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah first became king this word came from the lord saying
 this is what the lord has said take your place in the open square of the lords house and say to all the towns of judah who come into the lords house for worship everything i give you orders to say to them keep back not a word
 it may be that they will give ear and that every man will be turned from his evil way so that my purpose of sending evil on them because of the evil of their doings may be changed
 and you are to say to them this is what the lord has said if you do not give ear to me and go in the way of my law which i have put before you
 and give ear to the words of my servants the prophets whom i send to you getting up early and sending them though you gave no attention
 then i will make this house like shiloh and will make this town a curse to all the nations of the earth
 and in the hearing of the priests and the prophets and all the people jeremiah said these words in the house of the lord
 now when jeremiah had come to the end of saying everything the lord had given him orders to say to all the people the priests and the prophets and all the people took him by force saying death will certainly be your fate
 why have you said in the name of the lord this house will be like shiloh and this land a waste with no one living in it and all the people had come together to jeremiah in the house of the lord
 and the rulers of judah hearing of these things came up from the kings house to the house of the lord and took their seats by the new door of the lords house
 then the priests and the prophets said to the rulers and to all the people the right fate for this man is death for he has said words against this town in your hearing
 then jeremiah said to all the rulers and to all the people the lord has sent me as his prophet to say against this house and against this town all the words which have come to your ears
 so now make a change for the better in your ways and your doings and give ear to the voice of the lord your god then the lord will let himself be turned from the decision he has made against you for evil
 as for me here i am in your hands do with me whatever seems good and right in your opinion
 only be certain that if you put me to death you will make yourselves and your town and its people responsible for the blood of one who has done no wrong for truly the lord has sent me to you to say all these words in your ears
 then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and the prophets it is not right for this man to be put to death for he has said words to us in the name of the lord our god
 then some of the responsible men of the land got up and said to all the meeting of the people
 micah the morashtite who was a prophet in the days of hezekiah king of judah said to all the people of judah this is what the lord of armies has said zion will become like a ploughed field and jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls and the mountain of the house like the high places of the woodland
 did hezekiah and all judah put him to death did he not in the fear of the lord make prayer for the grace of the lord and the lord let himself be turned from the decision he had made against them for evil by this act we might do great evil against ourselves
 and there was another man who was a prophet of the lord uriah the son of shemaiah of kiriath jearim he said against this town and against this land all the words which jeremiah had said
 and when his words came to the ears of jehoiakim the king and all his men of war and his captains the king would have put him to death but uriah hearing of it was full of fear and went in flight into egypt
 and jehoiakim the king sent elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt
 and they took uriah out of egypt and came back with him to jehoiakim the king who put him to death with the sword and had his dead body put into the resting place of the bodies of the common people
 but ahikam the son of shaphan gave jeremiah his help so that he was not given into the hands of the people to be put to death
 when zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah first became king this word came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 this is what the lord has said to me make for yourself bands and yokes and put them on your neck
 and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the children of ammon and to the king of tyre and to the king of zidon by their servants who come to jerusalem to zedekiah king of judah
 and give them orders to say to their masters this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said say to your masters
 i have made the earth and man and beast on the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm and i will give it to anyone at my pleasure
 and now i have given all these lands into the hands of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and i have given the beasts of the field to him for his use
 and all the nations will be servants to him and to his son and to his sons son till the time comes for his land to be overcome and then a number of nations and great kings will take it for their use
 and it will come about that if any nation does not become a servant to this same nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of babylon then i will send punishment on that nation says the lord by the sword and need of food and by disease till i have given them into his hands
 and you are not to give attention to your prophets or your readers of signs or your dreamers or those who see into the future or those who make use of secret arts who say to you you will not become servants of the king of babylon
 for they say false words to you so that you may be sent away far from your land and so that you may be forced out by me and come to destruction
 but as for that nation which puts its neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and becomes his servant i will let that nation keep on in its land farming it and living in it says the lord
 and i said all this to zedekiah king of judah saying put your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and become his servants and his people so that you may keep your lives
 why are you desiring death you and your people by the sword and because food is gone and by disease as the lord has said of the nation which does not become the servant of the king of babylon
 and you are not to give ear to the prophets who say to you you will not become servants of the king of babylon for what they say is not true
 for i have not sent them says the lord but they are saying what is false in my name so that i might send you out by force causing destruction to come on you and on your prophets
 and i said to the priests and to all the people this is what the lord has said give no attention to the words of your prophets who say to you see in a very little time now the vessels of the lords house will come back again from babylon for what they say to you is false
 give no attention to them become servants of the king of babylon and keep yourselves from death why let this town become a waste
 but if they are prophets and if the word of the lord is with them let them now make request to the lord of armies that the vessels which are still in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem may not go to babylon
 for this is what the lord has said about the rest of the vessels which are still in this town
 which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon did not take away when he took jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah a prisoner from jerusalem to babylon with all the great men of judah and jerusalem
 for this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said about the rest of the vessels in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem
 they will be taken away to babylon and there they will be till the day when i send their punishment on them says the lord then i will take them up and put them back in their place
 and it came about in that year when zedekiah first became king of judah in the fourth year in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azzur the prophet who came from gibeon said to jeremiah in the house of the lord before the priests and all the people
 these are the words of the lord of armies the god of israel by me the yoke of the king of babylon has been broken
 in the space of two years i will send back into this place all the vessels of the lords house which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place to babylon
 and i will let jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah come back to this place with all the prisoners of judah who went to babylon says the lord for i will have the yoke of the king of babylon broken
 then the prophet jeremiah said to the prophet hananiah before the priests and all the people who had come into the house of the lord
 the prophet jeremiah said so be it may the lord do so may the lord give effect to the words which you have said and let the vessels of the lords house and all the people who have been taken away come back from babylon to this place
 but still give ear to this word which i am saying to you and to all the people
 the prophets who were before me and before you from early times gave word to a number of countries and great kingdoms about war and destruction and disease
 the prophet whose words are of peace when his words come true will be seen to be a prophet whom the lord has sent
 then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of the prophet jeremiah and it was broken by his hands
 and before all the people hananiah said the lord has said even so will i let the yoke of the king of babylon be broken off the necks of all the nations in the space of two years then the prophet jeremiah went away
 then after the yoke had been broken off the neck of the prophet jeremiah by hananiah the prophet the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 go and say to hananiah this is what the lord has said yokes of wood have been broken by you but in their place i will make yokes of iron
 for the lord of armies the god of israel has said i have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations making them servants to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they are to be his servants and in addition i have given him the beasts of the field
 then the prophet jeremiah said to hananiah the prophet give ear now hananiah the lord has not sent you but you are making this people put their faith in what is false
 for this reason the lord has said see i will send you away from off the face of the earth this year death will overtake you because you have said words against the lord
 so death came to hananiah the prophet the same year in the seventh month
 now these are the words of the letter which jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem to the responsible men among those who had been taken away and to the priests and the prophets and to all the rest of the people whom nebuchadnezzar had taken away prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
  after jeconiah the king and the queen mother and the unsexed servants and the rulers of judah and jerusalem and the expert workmen and the metal workers had gone away from jerusalem 
 by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah  whom zedekiah king of judah sent to babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon  saying
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said to all those whom i have taken away prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
 go on building houses and living in them and planting gardens and using the fruit of them
 take wives and have sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands so that they may have sons and daughters and be increased in number there and do not become less
 and be working for the peace of the land to which i have had you taken away prisoners and make prayer to the lord for it for in its peace you will have peace
 for this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said do not let yourselves be tricked by the prophets who are among you and the readers of signs and give no attention to their dreams which they may have
 for they are saying to you what is false in my name i have not sent them says the lord
 for this is what the lord has said when seventy years are ended for babylon i will have pity on you and give effect to my good purpose for you causing you to come back to this place
 for i am conscious of my thoughts about you says the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you hope at the end
 and you will go on crying to me and making prayer to me and i will give ear to you
 and you will be searching for me and i will be there when you have gone after me with all your heart
 i will be near you again says the lord and your fate will be changed and i will get you together from all the nations and from all the places where i had sent you away says the lord and i will take you back again to the place from which i sent you away prisoners
 for you have said the lord has given us prophets in babylon
 for this is what the lord has said about the king who is seated on the seat of davids kingdom and about all the people living in this town your countrymen who have not gone out with you as prisoners
 this is what the lord of armies has said see i will send on them the sword and need of food and disease and will make them like bad figs which are of no use for food they are so bad
 i will go after them attacking them with the sword and with need of food and with disease and will make them a cause of fear to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and a wonder and a surprise and a name of shame among all the nations where i have sent them
 because they have not given ear to my words says the lord when i sent to them my servants the prophets getting up early and sending them but you did not give ear says the lord
 and now give ear to the word of the lord all you whom i have sent away prisoners from jerusalem to babylon
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said about ahab the son of kolaiah and about zedekiah the son of maaseiah who are saying to you what is false in my name see i will give them up into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he will put them to death before your eyes
 and their fate will be used as a curse by all the prisoners of judah who are in babylon who will say may the lord make you like zedekiah and like ahab who were burned in the fire by the king of babylon
 because they have done shame in israel and have taken their neighbours wives and in my name have said false words which i did not give them orders to say and i myself am the witness says the lord
 about shemaiah the nehelamite
 shemaiah the nehelamite sent a letter in his name to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying
 the lord has made you priest in place of jehoiada the priest to be an overseer in the house of the lord for every man who is off his head and is acting as a prophet to put such men in prison and in chains
 so why have you made no protest against jeremiah of anathoth who is acting as a prophet to you
 for he has sent to us in babylon saying the time will be long go on building houses and living in them and planting gardens and using the fruit of them
 and zephaniah the priest made clear to jeremiah the prophet what was said in the letter reading it to him
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet saying
 send to all those who have been taken away saying this is what the lord has said about shemaiah the nehelamite because shemaiah has been acting as a prophet to you and i did not send him and has made you put your faith in what is false
 for this cause the lord has said truly i will send punishment on shemaiah and on his seed not a man of his family will have a place among this people and he will not see the good which i am going to do to my people says the lord because he has said words against the lord
 they say if a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another mans will he go back to her again will not that land have been made unclean but though you have been acting like a loose woman with a number of lovers will you now come back to me says the lord
 let your eyes be lifted up to the open hilltops and see where have you not been taken by your lovers you have been seated waiting for them by the wayside like an arabian in the waste land you have made the land unclean with your loose ways and your evil doing
 so the showers have been kept back and there has been no spring rain still your brow is the brow of a loose woman you will not let yourself be shamed
 will you not from this time make your prayer to me crying my father you are the friend of my early years
 will he be angry for ever will he keep his wrath to the end these things you have said and have done evil and have had your way
 and the lord said to me in the days of josiah the king have you seen what israel turning away from me has done she has gone up on every high mountain and under every branching tree acting like a loose woman there
 and i said after she has done all these things she will come back to me but she did not and her false sister judah saw it
 and though she saw that because israel turning away from me had been untrue to me i had put her away and given her a statement in writing ending the relation between us still judah her false sister had no fear but went and did the same
 so that through all her loose behaviour the land became unclean and she was untrue giving herself to stones and trees
 but for all this her false sister judah has not come back to me with all her heart but with deceit says the lord
 and the lord said to me israel in her turning away is seen to be more upright than false judah
 go and give out these words to the north and say come back o israel though you have been turned away from me says the lord my face will not be against you in wrath for i am full of mercy says the lord i will not be angry for ever
 only be conscious of your sin the evil you have done against the lord your god you have gone with strange men under every branching tree giving no attention to my voice says the lord
 come back o children who are turned away says the lord for i am a husband to you and i will take you one from a town and two from a family and will make you come to zion
 and i will give you keepers pleasing to my heart who will give you your food with knowledge and wisdom
 and it will come about when your numbers are increased in the land in those days says the lord that they will no longer say the ark of the agreement of the lord it will not come into their minds they will not have any memory of it or be conscious of the loss of it and it will not be made again
 at that time jerusalem will be named the seat of the lords kingdom and all the nations will come together to it to the name of the lord to jerusalem and no longer will their steps be guided by the purposes of their evil hearts
 in those days the family of judah will go with the family of israel and they will come together out of the land of the north into the land which i gave for a heritage to your fathers
 but i said how am i to put you among the children and give you a desired land a heritage of glory among the armies of the nations and i said you are to say to me my father and not be turned away from me
 truly as a wife is false to her husband so have you been false to me o israel says the lord
 a voice is sounding on the open hilltops the weeping and the prayers of the children of israel because their way is twisted they have not kept the lord their god in mind
 come back you children who have been turned away and i will take away your desire for wandering see we have come to you for you are the lord our god
 truly the hills and the noise of an army on the mountains are a false hope truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel
 but the baal has taken all the work of our fathers from our earliest days their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters
 let us be stretched on the earth in our downfall covering ourselves with our shame for we have been sinners against the lord our god we and our fathers from our earliest years even till this day and we have not given ear to the voice of the lord our god
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 the lord the god of israel has said put down in a book all the words which i have said to you
 for see the days are coming says the lord when i will let the fate of my people israel and judah be changed says the lord and i will make them come back to the land which i gave to their fathers so that they may take it for their heritage
 and these are the words which the lord said about israel and about judah
 this is what the lord has said a voice of shaking fear has come to our ears of fear and not of peace
 put the question and see if it is possible for a man to have birth pains why do i see every man with his hands gripping his sides as a woman does when the pains of birth are on her and all faces are turned green
 ha  for that day is so great that there is no day like it it is the time of jacobs trouble but he will get salvation from it
 for it will come about on that day says the lord of armies that his yoke will be broken off his neck and his bands will be burst and men of strange lands will no longer make use of him as their servant
 but they will be servants to the lord their god and to david their king whom i will give back to them
 so have no fear o jacob my servant says the lord and do not be troubled o israel for see i will make you come back from far away and your seed from the land where they are prisoners and jacob will come back and will be quiet and at peace and no one will give him cause for fear
 for i am with you says the lord to be your saviour for i will put an end to all the nations where i have sent you wandering but i will not put an end to you completely though with wise purpose i will put right your errors and will not let you go quite without punishment
 for the lord has said your disease may not be made well and your wound is bitter
 there is no help for your wound there is nothing to make you well
 your lovers have no more thought for you they go after you no longer for i have given you the wound of a hater even cruel punishment
 why are you crying for help because of your wound for your pain may never be taken away because your evil doing was so great and because your sins were increased i have done these things to you
 for this cause all those who take you for their food will themselves become your food and all your attackers every one of them will be taken prisoners and those who send destruction on you will come to destruction and all those who take away your goods by force will undergo the same themselves
 for i will make you healthy again and i will make you well from your wounds says the lord because they have given you the name of an outlaw saying it is zion cared for by no man
 the lord has said see i am changing the fate of the tents of jacob and i will have pity on his houses the town will be put up on its hill and the great houses will be living places again
 and from them will go out praise and the sound of laughing and i will make them great in number and they will not become less and i will give them glory and they will not be small
 and their children will be as they were in the old days and the meeting of the people will have its place before me and i will send punishment on all who are cruel to them
 and their chief will be of their number their ruler will come from among themselves and i will let him be present before me so that he may come near to me for who may have strength of heart to come near me says the lord
 and you will be my people and i will be your god
 see the storm wind of the lord even the heat of his wrath has gone out a rolling storm bursting on the heads of the evil doers
 the wrath of the lord will not be turned back till he has done till he has put into effect the purposes of his heart in days to come you will have full knowledge of this
 at that time says the lord i will be the god of all the families of israel and they will be my people
 the lord has said grace came in the waste land to a people kept safe from the sword even to israel on the way to his resting place
 from far away he saw the lord my love for you is an eternal love so with mercy i have made you come with me
 i will again make new your buildings o virgin of israel and you will take up your place again you will take up your instruments of music and go out in the dances of those who are glad
 again will your vine gardens be planted on the hill of samaria the planters will be planting and using the fruit
 for there will be a day when those who get in the grapes on the hills of ephraim will be crying up  let us go up to zion to the lord our god
 for the lord has said make a glad song for jacob and give a cry on the top of the mountains give the news give praise and say the lord has given salvation to his people even to the rest of israel
 see i will take them from the north country and get them from the inmost parts of the earth and with them the blind and the feeble footed the woman with child and her who is in birth pains together a very great army they will come back here
 they will come with weeping and going before them i will be their guide guiding them by streams of water in a straight way where there is no falling for i am a father to israel and ephraim is the first of my sons
 give ear to the word of the lord o you nations and give news of it in the sea lands far away and say he who has sent israel wandering will get him together and will keep him as a keeper does his flock
 for the lord has given a price for jacob and made him free from the hands of him who was stronger than he
 so they will come with songs on the high places flowing together to the good things of the lord to the grain and the wine and the oil to the young ones of the flock and of the herd their souls will be like a watered garden and they will have no more sorrow
 then the virgin will have joy in the dance and the young men and the old will be glad for i will have their weeping turned into joy i will give them comfort and make them glad after their sorrow
 i will give the priests their desired fat things and my people will have a full measure of my good things says the lord
 so has the lord said in ramah there is a sound of crying weeping and bitter sorrow rachel weeping for her children she will not be comforted for their loss
 the lord has said this keep your voice from sorrow and your eyes from weeping for your work will be rewarded says the lord and they will come back from the land of their hater
 and there is hope for the future says the lord and your children will come back to the land which is theirs
 certainly ephraims words of grief have come to my ears you have given me training and i have undergone it like a young cow unused to the yoke let me be turned and come back for you are the lord my god
 truly after i had been turned i had regret for my ways and after i had got knowledge i made signs of sorrow i was put to shame truly i was covered with shame because i had to undergo the shame of my early years
 is ephraim my dear son is he the child of my delight for whenever i say things against him i still keep him in my memory so my heart is troubled for him i will certainly have mercy on him says the lord
 put up guiding pillars make road signs for yourself give attention to the highway even the way in which you went be turned again o virgin of israel be turned to these your towns
 how long will you go on turning this way and that o wandering daughter for the lord has made a new thing on the earth a woman changed into a man
 so the lord of armies the god of israel has said again will these words be used in the land of judah and in its towns when i have let their fate be changed may the blessing of the lord be on you o resting place of righteousness o holy mountain
 and judah and all its towns will be living there together the farmers and those who go about with flocks
 for i have given new strength to the tired soul and to every sorrowing soul in full measure
 at this awaking from my sleep i saw and my sleep was sweet to me
 see the days are coming says the lord when i will have israel and judah planted with the seed of man and with the seed of beast
 and it will come about that as i have been watching over them for the purpose of uprooting and smashing down and overturning and sending destruction and causing trouble so i will be watching over them for the purpose of building up and planting says the lord
 in those days they will no longer say the fathers have been tasting bitter grapes and the childrens teeth are put on edge
 but everyone will be put to death for the evil which he himself has done whoever has taken bitter grapes will himself have his teeth put on edge
 see the days are coming says the lord when i will make a new agreement with the people of israel and with the people of judah
 not like the agreement which i made with their fathers on the day when i took them by the hand to be their guide out of the land of egypt which agreement was broken by them and i gave them up says the lord
 but this is the agreement which i will make with the people of israel after those days says the lord i will put my law in their inner parts writing it in their hearts and i will be their god and they will be my people
 and no longer will they be teaching every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying get knowledge of the lord for they will all have knowledge of me from the least of them to the greatest of them says the lord for they will have my forgiveness for their evil doing and their sin will go from my memory for ever
 these are the words of the lord who has given the sun for a light by day ordering the moon and stars for a light by night who puts the sea in motion causing the thunder of its waves the lord of armies is his name
 if the order of these things before me is ever broken says the lord then will the seed of israel come to an end as a nation before me for ever
 this is what the lord has said if the heavens on high may be measured and the bases of the earth searched out then i will give up the seed of israel because of all they have done says the lord
 see the days are coming says the lord for the building of the lords town from the tower of hananel to the doorway of the angle
 and the measuring line will go out in front of it as far as the hill gareb going round to goah
 and all the valley of the dead bodies and all the field of death as far as the stream kidron up to the angle of the horses doorway to the east will be holy to the lord it will not again be uprooted or overturned for ever
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar
 now at that time the king of babylons army was round jerusalem shutting it in and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen in the house of the king of judah
 for zedekiah king of judah had had him shut up saying why have you as a prophet been saying the lord has said see i will give this town into the hands of the king of babylon and he will take it
 and zedekiah king of judah will not get away from the hands of the chaldaeans but will certainly be given up into the hands of the king of babylon and will have talk with him mouth to mouth and see him eye to eye
 and he will take zedekiah away to babylon where he will be till i have pity on him says the lord though you are fighting with the chaldaeans things will not go well for you
 and jeremiah said the word of the lord came to me saying
 see hanamel the son of shallum your fathers brother will come to you and say give the price and get for yourself my property in anathoth for you have the right of the nearest relation
 so hanamel the son of my fathers brother came to me as the lord had said to the place of the armed watchmen and said to me give the price and get my property which is in anathoth in the land of benjamin for you have the nearest relations right to the heritage so get it for yourself then it was clear to me that this was the word of the lord
 so i got for a price the property in anathoth from hanamel the son of my fathers brother and gave him the money seventeen shekels of silver
 and i put it in writing stamping it with my stamp and i took witnesses and put the money into the scales
 so i took the paper witnessing the business one copy rolled up and stamped and one copy open
 and i gave the paper to baruch the son of neriah the son of mahseiah before the eyes of hanamel the son of my fathers brother and of the witnesses who had put their names to the paper and before all the jews who were seated in the place of the armed watchmen
 and i gave orders to baruch in front of them saying
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said take these papers the witness of this business the one which is rolled up and stamped and the one which is open and put them in a vessel of earth so that they may be kept for a long time
 for the lord of armies the god of israel has said there will again be trading in houses and fields and vine gardens in this land
 now after i had given the paper to baruch the son of neriah i made my prayer to the lord saying
 ah lord god  see you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm and there is nothing you are not able to do
 you have mercy on thousands and send punishment for the evil doing of the fathers on their children after them the great the strong god the lord of armies is his name
 great in wisdom and strong in act whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men giving to everyone the reward of his ways and the fruit of his doings
 you have done signs and wonders in the land of egypt and even to this day in israel and among other men and have made a name for yourself as at this day
 and have taken your people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm causing great fear
 and have given them this land which you gave your word to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey
 and they came in and took it for their heritage but they did not give ear to your voice and were not ruled by your law they have done nothing of all you gave them orders to do so you have made all this evil come on them
 see they have made earthworks against the town to take it and the town is given into the hands of the chaldaeans who are fighting against it because of the sword and need of food and disease and what you have said has taken place and truly you see it
 and you have said to me give the money to get yourself a property and have the business witnessed though the town is given into the hands of the chaldaeans
 and the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 see i am the lord the god of all flesh is there anything so hard that i am unable to do it
 so this is what the lord has said see i am giving this town into the hands of the chaldaeans and into the hands of nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon and he will take it
 and the chaldaeans who are fighting against this town will come and put the town on fire burning it together with the houses on the roofs of which perfumes have been burned to the baal and drink offerings have been drained out to other gods moving me to wrath
 for the children of israel and the children of judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes from their earliest years the children of israel have only made me angry with the work of their hands says the lord
 for this town has been to me a cause of wrath and of burning passion from the day of its building till this day so that i put it away from before my face
 because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have done to make me angry they and their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the people of jerusalem
 and they have been turning their backs and not their faces to me and though i was their teacher getting up early and teaching them their ears were not open to teaching
 but they put their disgusting images into the house which is named by my name making it unclean
 and they put up the high places of the baal in the valley of the son of hinnom making their sons and their daughters go through the fire to molech which i did not give them orders to do and it never came into my mind that they would do this disgusting thing causing judah to be turned out of the way
 and now the lord the god of israel has said of this town about which you say it is given into the hands of the king of babylon by the sword and by need of food and by disease
 see i will get them together from all the countries where i have sent them in my wrath and in the heat of my passion and in my bitter feeling and i will let them come back into this place where they may take their rest safely
 and they will be my people and i will be their god
 and i will give them one heart and one way so that they may go on in the worship of me for ever for their good and the good of their children after them
 and i will make an eternal agreement with them that i will never give them up but ever do them good and i will put the fear of me in their hearts so that they will not go away from me
 and truly i will take pleasure in doing them good and all my heart and soul will be given to planting them in this land in good faith
 for the lord has said as i have made all this great evil come on this people so i will send on them all the good which i said about them
 and there will be trading in fields in this land of which you say it is a waste without man or beast it is given into the hands of the chaldaeans
 men will get fields for money and put the business in writing stamping the papers and having them witnessed in the land of benjamin and in the country round jerusalem and in the towns of judah and in the towns of the hill country and in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the south for i will let their fate be changed says the lord
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah the second time while he was still shut up in the place of the armed watchmen saying
 these are the words of the lord who is doing it the lord who is forming it to make it certain the lord is his name
 let your cry come to me and i will give you an answer and let you see great things and secret things of which you had no knowledge
 for this is what the lord the god of israel has said about the houses of this town and the houses of the kings of judah which have been broken down to make earthworks and 
  and to make them full of the dead bodies of men whom i have put to death in my wrath and in my passion and because of whose evil doing i have kept my face covered from this town
 see i will make it healthy and well again i will even make them well i will let them see peace and good faith in full measure
 and i will let the fate of judah and of israel be changed building them up as at first
 and i will make them clean from all their sin with which they have been sinning against me i will have forgiveness for all their sins with which they have been sinning against me and with which they have done evil against me
 and this town will be to me for a name of joy for a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who hearing of all the good which i am doing for them will be shaking with fear because of all the good and the peace which i am doing for it
 this is what the lord has said there will again be sounding in this place of which you say it is a waste without man and without beast even in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem which are waste and unpeopled without man and without beast
 happy sounds the voice of joy the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride the voices of those who say give praise to the lord of armies for the lord is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever the voices of those who go with praise into the house of the lord for i will let the land come back to its first condition says the lord
 this is what the lord of armies has said again there will be in this place which is a waste without man and without beast and in all its towns a resting place where the keepers of sheep will make their flocks take rest
 in the towns of the hill country in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the country round jerusalem and in the towns of judah the flocks will again go under the hand of him who is numbering them says the lord
 see the days are coming says the lord when i will give effect to the good word which i have said about the people of israel and the people of judah
 in those days and at that time i will let a branch of righteousness come up for david and he will be a judge in righteousness in the land
 in those days judah will have salvation and jerusalem will be safe and this is the name which will be given to her the lord is our righteousness
 for the lord has said david will never be without a man to take his place on the seat of the kingdom of israel
 and the priests and the levites will never be without a man to come before me offering burned offerings and perfumes and meal offerings and offerings of beasts at all times
 and the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 the lord has said if it is possible for my agreement of the day and the night to be broken so that day and night no longer come at their fixed times
 then my agreement with my servant david may be broken so that he no longer has a son to take his place on the seat of the kingdom and my agreement with the levites the priests my servants
 as it is not possible for the army of heaven to be numbered or the sand of the sea measured so will i make the seed of my servant david and the levites my servants
 and the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 have you taken note of what these people have said the two families which the lord took for himself he has given up this they say looking down on my people as being in their eyes no longer a nation
 the lord has said if i have not made day and night and if the limits of heaven and earth have not been fixed by me
 then i will give up caring for the seed of jacob and of david my servant so that i will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will let their fate be changed and will have mercy on them
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth which were under his rule and all the peoples were fighting against jerusalem and all its towns saying
 the lord the god of israel has said go and say to zedekiah king of judah this is what the lord has said see i will give this town into the hands of the king of babylon and he will have it burned with fire
 and you will not get away from him but will certainly be taken and given up into his hands and you will see the king of babylon eye to eye and he will have talk with you mouth to mouth and you will go to babylon
 but give ear to the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah this is what the lord has said about you death will not come to you by the sword
 you will come to your end in peace and such burnings as they made for your fathers the earlier kings before you will be made for you and they will be weeping for you and saying ah lord  for i have said the word says the lord
 then jeremiah the prophet said all these things to zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem
 when the army of the king of babylon was fighting against jerusalem and against all the towns of judah which had not been taken against lachish and against azekah for these were the last of the walled towns of judah
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord after king zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in jerusalem to give news in public that servants were to be made free
 that every man was to let his hebrew man servant and his hebrew servant girl go free so that no one might make use of a jew his countryman as a servant
 and this was done by all the rulers and the people who had taken part in the agreement and every one let his man servant and his servant girl go free not to be used as servants any longer they did so and let them go
 but later they took back again the servants and the servant girls whom they had let go free and put them again under the yoke as servants and servant girls
 for this reason the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 the lord the god of israel has said i made an agreement with your fathers on the day when i took them out of egypt out of the prison house saying
 at the end of seven years every man is to let go his countryman who is a hebrew who has become yours for a price and has been your servant for six years you are to let him go free but your fathers gave no attention and did not give ear
 and now turning away from evil you had done what is right in my eyes giving a public undertaking for every man to make his neighbour free and you had made an agreement before me in the house which is named by my name
 but again you have put shame on my name and you have taken back every one his man servant and his servant girl whom you had sent away free and you have put them under the yoke again to be your servants and servant girls
 and so the lord has said you have not given ear to me and undertaken publicly every man to let loose his countryman and his neighbour see i undertake to let loose against you the sword and disease and need of food and i will send you wandering among all the kingdoms of the earth
 and i will give the men who have gone against my agreement and have not given effect to the words of the agreement which they made before me when the ox was cut in two and they went between the parts of it
 the rulers of judah and the rulers of jerusalem the unsexed servants and the priests and all the people of the land who went between the parts of the ox
 even these i will give up into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth
 and zedekiah king of judah and his rulers i will give into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives and into the hands of the king of babylons army which has gone away from you
 see i will give orders says the lord and make them come back to this town and they will make war on it and take it and have it burned with fire and i will make the towns of judah waste and unpeopled
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying
 go into the house of the rechabites and have talk with them and take them into the house of the lord into one of the rooms and give them wine
 then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and all the rechabites
 and i took them into the house of the lord into the room of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah the man of god which was near the rulers room which was over the room of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door
 and i put before the sons of the rechabites basins full of wine and cups and i said to them take some wine
 but they said we will take no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father gave us orders saying you are to take no wine you or your sons for ever
 and you are to make no houses or put in seed or get vine gardens planted or have any but all your days you are to go on living in tents so that you may have a long life in the land where you are living as in a strange country
 and we have kept the rules of jonadab the son of rechab our father in everything which he gave us orders to do drinking no wine all our days we and our wives and our sons and our daughters
 building no houses for ourselves having no vine gardens or fields or seed
 but we have been living in tents and have done everything which jonadab our father gave us orders to do
 but when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land we said come let us go to jerusalem away from the army of the chaldaeans and from the army of the aramaeans and so we are living in jerusalem
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said go and say to the men of judah and the people of jerusalem is there no hope of teaching you to give ear to my words says the lord
 the orders which jonadab the son of rechab gave to his sons to take no wine are done and to this day they take no wine for they do the orders of their father but i have sent my words to you getting up early and sending them and you have not given ear to me
 and i have sent you all my servants the prophets getting up early and sending them saying come back now every man from his evil way and do better and go not after other gods to become their servants and you will go on living in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but your ears have not been open and you have not given attention to me
 though the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have done the orders of their father which he gave them this people has not given ear to me
 for this reason the lord the god of armies the god of israel has said see i will send on judah and on all the people of jerusalem all the evil which i said i would do to them because i sent my words to them but they did not give ear crying out to them but they gave no answer
 but to the rechabites jeremiah said this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said because you have done the orders of jonadab your father and have kept his rules and done everything as he gave you orders to do it
 for this reason the lord of armies the god of israel has said jonadab the son of rechab will never be without a man to take his place before me
 now it came about in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 take a book and put down in it all the words i have said to you against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day when my word came to you in the days of josiah till this day
 it may be that the people of judah hearing of all the evil which it is my purpose to do to them will be turned every man from his evil ways so that they may have my forgiveness for their evil doing and their sin
 then jeremiah sent for baruch the son of neriah and baruch took down from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had said to him writing them in a book
 and jeremiah gave orders to baruch saying i am shut up and am not able to go into the house of the lord
 so you are to go reading there from the book which you have taken down from my mouth the words of the lord in the hearing of the people in the lords house on a day when they go without food and in the hearing of all the men of judah who have come out from their towns
 it may be that their prayer for grace will go up to the lord and that every man will be turned from his evil ways for great is the wrath and the passion made clear by the lord against this people
 and baruch the son of neriah did as jeremiah the prophet gave him orders to do reading from the book the words of the lord in the lords house
 now it came about in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that it was given out publicly that all the people in jerusalem and all the people who came from the towns of judah to jerusalem were to keep from food before the lord
 then baruch gave a public reading of the words of jeremiah from the book in the house of the lord in the room of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the higher square as one goes in by the new doorway of the lords house in the hearing of all the people
 and micaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan after hearing all the words of the lord from the book
 went down to the kings house to the scribes room and all the rulers were seated there elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the rulers
 then micaiah gave them an account of all the words which had come to his ears when baruch was reading the book to the people
 so all the rulers sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi to baruch saying take in your hand the book from which you have been reading to the people and come so baruch the son of neriah took the book in his hand and came down to them
 then they said to him be seated now and give us a reading from it so baruch did so reading it to them
 now it came about that after hearing all the words they said to one another in fear we will certainly give the king an account of all these words
 and questioning baruch they said say now how did you put all these words down in writing from his mouth
 then baruch answering said he said all these things to me by word of mouth and i put them down with ink in the book
 then the rulers said to baruch go and put yourself in a safe place you and jeremiah and let no man have knowledge of where you are
 then they went into the open square to the king but the book they put away in the room of elishama the scribe and they gave the king an account of all the words
 so the king sent jehudi to get the book and he took it from the room of elishama the scribe and jehudi gave a reading of it in the hearing of the king and all the rulers who were by the kings side
 now the king was seated in the winter house and a fire was burning in the fireplace in front of him
 and it came about that whenever jehudi in his reading had got through three or four divisions the king cutting them with his penknife put them into the fire till all the book was burned up in the fire which was burning in the fireplace
 but they had no fear and gave no signs of grief not the king or any of his servants after hearing all these words
 and elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made a strong request to the king not to let the book be burned but he would not give ear to them
 and the king gave orders to jerahmeel the kings son and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord kept them safe
 then after the book in which baruch had put down the words of jeremiah had been burned by the king the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
 take another book and put down in it all the words which were in the first book which jehoiakim king of judah put into the fire
 and about jehoiakim king of judah you are to say this is what the lord has said you have put this book into the fire saying why have you put in it that the king of babylon will certainly come causing the destruction of this land and putting an end to every man and beast in it
 for this reason the lord has said of jehoiakim king of judah he will have no son to take his place on the seat of david his dead body will be put out to undergo the heat of the day and the cold of the night
 and i will send punishment on him and on his seed and on his servants for their evil doing i will send on them and on the people of jerusalem and the men of judah all the evil which i said against them but they did not give ear
 then jeremiah took another book and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who put down in it from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which had been burned in the fire by jehoiakim king of judah and in addition a number of other words of the same sort
 and zedekiah the son of josiah became king in place of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah
 but he and his servants and the people of the land did not give ear to the words of the lord which he said by jeremiah the prophet
 and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying make prayer now to the lord our god for us
  now jeremiah was going about among the people for they had not put him in prison
 and pharaohs army had come out from egypt and the chaldaeans who were attacking jerusalem hearing news of them went away from jerusalem 
 then the word of the lord came to the prophet jeremiah saying
 the lord the god of israel has said this is what you are to say to the king of judah who sent you to get directions from me see pharaohs army which has come out to your help will go back to egypt to their land
 and the chaldaeans will come back again and make war against this town and they will take it and put it on fire
 the lord has said have no false hopes saying to yourselves the chaldaeans will go away from us for they will not go away
 for even if you had overcome all the army of the chaldaeans fighting against you and there were only wounded men among them still they would get up every man in his tent and put this town on fire
 and it came about that when the chaldaean army outside jerusalem had gone away for fear of pharaohs army
 jeremiah went out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin with the purpose of taking up his heritage there among the people
 but when he was at the benjamin door a captain of the watch named irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah who was stationed there put his hand on jeremiah the prophet saying you are going to give yourself up to the chaldaeans
 then jeremiah said that is not true i am not going to the chaldaeans but he would not give ear to him so irijah made him prisoner and took him to the rulers
 and the rulers were angry with jeremiah and gave him blows and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison
 so jeremiah came into the hole of the prison under the arches and was there for a long time
 then king zedekiah sent and got him out and the king questioning him secretly in his house said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said there is then he said you will be given up into the hands of the king of babylon
 then jeremiah said to king zedekiah what has been my sin against you or against your servants or against this people that you have put me in prison
 where now are your prophets who said to you the king of babylon will not come against you and against this land
 and now be pleased to give ear o my lord the king let my prayer for help come before you and do not make me go back to the house of jonathan the scribe for fear that i may come to my death there
 then by the order of zedekiah the king jeremiah was put into the place of the armed watchmen and they gave him every day a cake of bread from the street of the bread makers till all the bread in the town was used up so jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen
 now it came to the ears of shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashhur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashhur the son of malchiah that jeremiah had said to all the people
 these are the words of the lord whoever goes on living in this town will come to his death by the sword or through need of food or by disease but whoever goes out to the chaldaeans will keep his life out of the power of the attackers and be safe
 the lord has said this town will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of babylon and he will take it
 then the rulers said to the king let this man be put to death because he is putting fear into the hearts of the men of war who are still in the town and into the hearts of the people by saying such things to them this man is not working for the well being of the people but for their damage
 then zedekiah the king said see he is in your hands for the king was not able to do anything against them
 so they took jeremiah and put him into the water hole of malchiah the kings son in the place of the armed watchmen and they let jeremiah down with cords and in the hole there was no water but wet earth and jeremiah went down into the wet earth
 now it came to the ears of ebed melech the ethiopian an unsexed servant in the kings house that they had put jeremiah into the water hole the king at that time being seated in the doorway of benjamin
 and ebed melech went out from the kings house and said to the king
 my lord the king these men have done evil in all they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have put into the water hole and he will come to his death in the place where he is through need of food for there is no more bread in the town
 then the king gave orders to ebed melech the ethiopian saying take with you three men from here and get jeremiah out of the water hole before death overtakes him
 so ebed melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king to the place where the clothing was kept and got from there old clothing and bits of old cloth and let them down by cords into the water hole where jeremiah was
 and ebed melech the ethiopian said to jeremiah put these bits of old cloth under your arms under the cords and jeremiah did so
 so pulling jeremiah up with the cords they got him out of the water hole and jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen
 then king zedekiah sent for jeremiah the prophet and took him into the rulers doorway in the house of the lord and the king said to jeremiah i have a question to put to you keep nothing back from me
 then jeremiah said to zedekiah if i give you the answer to your question will you not certainly put me to death and if i make a suggestion to you you will not give it a hearing
 so king zedekiah gave his oath to jeremiah secretly saying by the living lord who gave us our life i will not put you to death or give you up to these men who are desiring to take your life
 then jeremiah said to zedekiah these are the words of the lord the god of armies the god of israel if you go out to the king of babylons captains then you will have life and the town will not be burned with fire and you and your family will be kept from death
 but if you do not go out to the king of babylons captains then this town will be given into the hands of the chaldaeans and they will put it on fire and you will not get away from them
 and king zedekiah said to jeremiah i am troubled on account of the jews who have gone over to the chaldaeans for fear that they may give me up to them and they will put me to shame
 but jeremiah said they will not give you up be guided now by the word of the lord as i have given it to you and it will be well for you and you will keep your life
 but if you do not go out this is what the lord has made clear to me
 see all the rest of the women in the house of the king of judah will be taken out to the king of babylons captains and these women will say your nearest friends have been false to you and have got the better of you they have made your feet go deep into the wet earth and they are turned away back from you
 and they will take all your wives and your children out to the chaldaeans and you will not get away out of their hands but will be taken by the hands of the king of babylon and this town will be burned with fire
 then zedekiah said to jeremiah let no man have knowledge of these words and you will not be put to death
 but if it comes to the ears of the rulers that i have been talking with you and they come and say to you give us word now of what you have said to the king and what the king said to you keeping nothing back and we will not put you to death
 then you are to say to them i made my request to the king that he would not send me back to my death in jonathans house
 then all the rulers came to jeremiah questioning him and he gave them an answer in the words the king had given him orders to say so they said nothing more to him for the thing was not made public
 so jeremiah was kept in the place of the armed watchmen till the day when jerusalem was taken
 and it came about that when jerusalem was taken  in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month nebuchadrezzar king of babylon with all his army came against jerusalem shutting it in on every side
 in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month the town was broken into 
 all the captains of the king of babylon came in and took their places in the middle doorway of the town nergal shar ezer ruler of sin magir the rabmag and nebushazban the rab saris and all the captains of the king of babylon
 and when zedekiah king of judah and all the men of war saw it they went in flight from the town by night by the way of the kings garden through the doorway between the two walls and they went out by the arabah
 but the chaldaean army went after them and overtook zedekiah in the lowlands of jericho and they made him a prisoner and took him up to nebuchadrezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath to be judged by him
 then the king of babylon put the sons of zedekiah to death before his eyes in riblah and the king of babylon put to death all the great men of judah
 and more than this he put out zedekiahs eyes and had him put in chains to take him away to babylon
 and the chaldaeans put the kings house on fire as well as the houses of the people and had the walls of jerusalem broken down
 then nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away to babylon as prisoners all the rest of the workmen who were still in the town as well as those who had given themselves up to him and all the rest of the people
 but nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men let the poorest of the people who had nothing whatever go on living in the land of judah and gave them vine gardens and fields at the same time
 now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave orders about jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men saying
 take him and keep an eye on him and see that no evil comes to him but do with him whatever he says to you
 so nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men sent nebushazban the rab saris and nergal shar ezer the rabmag and all the chief captains of the king of babylon
 and they sent and took jeremiah out of the place of the watchmen and gave him into the care of gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan to take him to his house so he was living among the people
 now the word of the lord came to jeremiah while he was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen saying
 go and say to ebed melech the ethiopian this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see my words will come true for this town for evil and not for good they will come about before your eyes on that day
 but i will keep you safe on that day says the lord you will not be given into the hands of the men you are fearing
 for i will certainly let you go free and you will not be put to the sword but your life will be given to you out of the hands of your attackers because you have put your faith in me says the lord
 if you will come back o israel says the lord you will come back to me and if you will put away your disgusting ways you will not be sent away from before me
 and you will take your oath by the living lord in good faith and wisdom and righteousness and the nations will make use of you as a blessing and in you will they take a pride
 for this is what the lord says to the men of judah and to jerusalem get your unworked land ploughed up do not put in your seeds among thorns
 undergo a circumcision of the heart you men of judah and people of jerusalem or my wrath may come out like fire burning so that no one is able to put it out because of the evil of your doings
 say openly in judah give it out in jerusalem and say let the horn be sounded in the land crying out in a loud voice come together and let us go into the walled towns
 put up a flag for a sign to zion go in flight so that you may be safe waiting no longer for i will send evil from the north and a great destruction
 a lion has gone up from his secret place in the woods and one who makes waste the nations is on his way he has gone out from his place to make your land unpeopled so that your towns will be made waste with no man living in them
 for this put on haircloth with weeping and loud crying for the burning wrath of the lord is not turned back from us
 and it will come about in that day says the lord that the heart of the king will be dead in him and the hearts of the rulers and the priests will be overcome with fear and the prophets with wonder
 then said i ah lord god  your words were not true when you said to this people and to jerusalem you will have peace when the sword has come even to the soul
 at that time it will be said to this people and to jerusalem a burning wind from the open hilltops in the waste land is blowing on the daughter of my people not for separating or cleaning the grain
 a full wind will come for me and now i will give my decision against them
 see he will come up like the clouds and his war carriages like the storm wind his horses are quicker than eagles sorrow is ours for destruction has come on us
 o jerusalem make your heart clean from evil so that you may have salvation how long are evil purposes to have a resting place in you
 for a voice is sounding from dan giving out evil from the hills of ephraim
 make this come to the minds of the nations make a statement openly against jerusalem that attackers are coming from a far country and their voices will be loud against the towns of judah
 like keepers of a field they are against her on every side because she has been fighting against me says the lord
 your ways and your doings have made these things come on you this is your sin truly it is bitter going deep into your heart
 my soul my soul  i am pained to my inmost heart my heart is troubled in me i am not able to be quiet because the sound of the horn the note of war has come to my ears
 news is given of destruction on destruction all the land is made waste suddenly my tents straight away my curtains are made waste
 how long will i go on seeing the flag and hearing the sound of the war horn
 for my people are foolish they have no knowledge of me they are evil minded children without sense all of them they are wise in evil doing but have no knowledge of doing good
 looking at the earth i saw that it was waste and without form and to the heavens that they had no light
 looking at the mountains i saw them shaking and all the hills were moved about
 looking i saw that there was no man and all the birds of heaven had gone in flight
 looking i saw that the fertile field was a waste and all its towns were broken down before the lord and before his burning wrath
 for this is what the lord has said all the land will become a waste i will make destruction complete
 the earth will be weeping for this and the heavens on high will be black because i have said it and i will not go back from it it is my purpose and it will not be changed
 all the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks every town has been given up not a man is living in them
 and you when you are made waste what will you do though you are clothed in red though you make yourself beautiful with ornaments of gold though you make your eyes wide with paint it is for nothing that you make yourself fair your lovers have no more desire for you they have designs on your life
 a voice has come to my ears like the voice of a woman in birth pains the pain of one giving birth to her first child the voice of the daughter of zion fighting for breath stretching out her hands saying now sorrow is mine  for my strength is gone from me before the takers of life
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord after nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had let him go from ramah when he had taken him for he had been put in chains among all the prisoners of jerusalem and judah who were taken away prisoners to babylon
 and the captain of the armed men took jeremiah and said to him the lord your god gave word of the evil which was to come on this place
 *** and the lord has made it come and has done as he said because of your sin against the lord in not giving ear to his voice and that is why this thing has come on you
 now see this day i am freeing you from the chains which are on your hands if it seems good to you to come with me to babylon then come and i will keep an eye on you but if it does not seem good to you to come with me to babylon then do not come see all the land is before you if it seems good and right to you to go on living in the land
 then go back to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon has made ruler over the towns of judah and make your living place with him among the people or go wherever it seems right to you to go so the captain of the armed men gave him food and some money and let him go
 so jeremiah went to gedaliah the son of ahikam in mizpah and was living with him among the people who were still in the land
 now when it came to the ears of all the captains of the forces who were in the field and their men that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam ruler in the land and had put under his care the men and women and children all the poorest of the land those who had not been taken away to babylon
 then they came to gedaliah in mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of the maacathite they and their men
 and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan took an oath to them and their men saying have no fear of the servants of the chaldaeans go on living in the land and become the servants of the king of babylon and all will be well
 as for me i will be living in mizpah as your representative before the chaldaeans who come to us but you are to get in your wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and make living places for yourselves in the towns which you have taken
 in the same way when all the jews who were in moab and among the children of ammon and in edom and in all the countries had news that the king of babylon had let judah keep some of its people and that he had put over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan
 then all the jews came back from all the places to which they had gone in flight and came to the land of judah to gedaliah to mizpah and got in a great store of wine and summer fruit
 now johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces which were in the field came to gedaliah in mizpah
 and said to him has it come to your knowledge that baalis the king of the children of ammon has sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to take your life but gedaliah the son of ahikam put no faith in what they said
 then johanan the son of kareah said to gedaliah in mizpah secretly let me now go and put ishmael the son of nethaniah to death without anyones knowledge why let him take your life so that all the jews who have come together to you may be sent in flight and the rest of the men of judah come to an end
 but gedaliah the son of ahikam said to johanan the son of kareah you are not to do this for what you say about ishmael is false
 now it came about in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the kings seed having with him ten men came to gedaliah the son of ahikam in mizpah and they had a meal together in mizpah
 then ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and attacking gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword put to death him whom the king of babylon had made ruler over the land
 and ishmael put to death all the jews who were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldaean men of war
 now on the second day after he had put gedaliah to death when no one had knowledge of it
 some people came from shechem from shiloh and samaria eighty men with the hair of their faces cut off and their clothing out of order and with cuts on their bodies and in their hands meal offerings and perfumes which they were taking to the house of the lord
 and ishmael the son of nethaniah went out from mizpah with the purpose of meeting them weeping on his way and it came about that when he was face to face with them he said come to gedaliah the son of ahikam
 and when they came inside the town ishmael the son of nethaniah and the men who were with him put them to death and put their bodies into a deep hole
 but there were ten men among them who said to ishmael do not put us to death for we have secret stores in the country of grain and oil and honey so he did not put them to death with their countrymen
 now the hole into which ishmael had put the dead bodies of the men whom he had put to death was the great hole which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah made it full of the bodies of those who had been put to death
 then ishmael took away as prisoners all the rest of the people who were in mizpah the kings daughters and all the people still in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had put under the care of gedaliah the son of ahikam ishmael the son of nethaniah took them away prisoners with the purpose of going over to the children of ammon
 but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the armed forces who were with him had news of all the evil which ishmael the son of nethaniah had done
 they took their men and went out to make war on ishmael the son of nethaniah and they came face to face with him by the great waters in gibeon
 now when all the people who were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces with him then they were glad
 and all the people whom ishmael had taken away prisoners from mizpah turning round came back and went to johanan the son of kareah
 but ishmael the son of nethaniah got away from johanan with eight men and went to the children of ammon
 then johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the rest of the people whom ishmael the son of nethaniah had made prisoners after he had put to death gedaliah the son of ahikam the people from mizpah that is the men of war and the women and the children and the unsexed servants whom he had taken back with him from gibeon
 and they went and were living in the resting place of chimham which is near beth lehem on the way into egypt
 because of the chaldaeans for they were in fear of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had put to death gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon had made ruler over the land
 then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least to the greatest came near
 and said to jeremiah the prophet let our request come before you and make prayer for us to the lord your god even for this small band of us for we are only a small band out of what was a great number as your eyes may see
 that the lord your god may make clear to us the way in which we are to go and what we are to do
 then jeremiah the prophet said to them i have given ear to you see i will make prayer to the lord your god as you have said and it will be that whatever the lord may say in answer to you i will give you word of it keeping nothing back
 then they said to jeremiah may the lord be a true witness against us in good faith if we do not do everything which the lord your god sends you to say to us
 if it is good or if it is evil we will be guided by the voice of the lord our god to whom we are sending you so that it may be well for us when we give ear to the voice of the lord our god
 and it came about that after ten days the word of the lord came to jeremiah
 and he sent for johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces who were still with him and all the people from the least to the greatest
 and said to them these are the words of the lord the god of israel to whom you sent me to put your request before him
 if you still go on living in the land then i will go on building you up and not pulling you down planting you and not uprooting you for my purpose of doing evil to you has been changed
 have no fear of the king of babylon of whom you are now in fear have no fear of him says the lord for i am with you to keep you safe and to give you salvation from his hands
 and i will have mercy on you so that he may have mercy on you and let you go back to your land
 but if you say we have no desire to go on living in this land and do not give ear to the voice of the lord your god
 saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we will not see war or be hearing the sound of the horn or be in need of food there we will make our living place
 then give ear now to the word of the lord o you last of judah the lord of armies the god of israel has said if your minds are fixed on going into egypt and stopping there
 then it will come about that the sword which is the cause of your fear will overtake you there in the land of egypt and need of food which you are fearing will go after you there in egypt and there death will come to you
 such will be the fate of all the men whose minds are fixed on going into egypt and stopping there they will come to their end by the sword by being short of food and by disease not one of them will keep his life or get away from the evil which i will send on them
 for this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said as my wrath and passion have been let loose on the people of jerusalem so will my passion be let loose on you when you go into egypt and you will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame and you will never see this place again
 the lord has said about you o last of judah go not into egypt be certain that i have given witness to you this day
 for you have been acting with deceit in your hearts for you sent me to the lord your god saying make prayer for us to the lord our god and give us word of everything he may say and we will do it
 and this day i have made it clear to you and you have not given ear to the voice of the lord your god in anything for which he has sent me to you
 and now be certain that you will come to your end by the sword and by being short of food and by disease in the place to which you are pleased to go for a living place
 and it came about that when jeremiah had come to the end of giving all the people the words of the lord their god which the lord their god had sent him to say to them even all these words
 then azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the men of pride said to jeremiah you have said what is false the lord our god has not sent you to say you are not to go into the land of egypt and make your living place there
 but baruch the son of neriah is moving you against us to give us up into the hands of the chaldaeans so that they may put us to death and take us away prisoners into babylon
 so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people did not give ear to the order of the lord that they were to go on living in the land of judah
 but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the rest of judah who had come back into the land of judah from all the nations where they had been forced to go
 the men and the women and the children and the kings daughters and every person whom nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men had put under the care of gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah
 and they came into the land of egypt for they did not give ear to the voice of the lord and they came to tahpanhes
 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah in tahpanhes saying
 take in your hand some great stones and put them in a safe place in the paste in the brickwork which is at the way into pharaohs house in tahpanhes before the eyes of the men of judah
 and say to them this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and he will put the seat of his kingdom on these stones which have been put in a safe place here by you and his tent will be stretched over them
 and he will come and overcome the land of egypt those who are for death will be put to death those who are to be prisoners will be made prisoners and those who are for the sword will be given to the sword
 and he will put a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and they will be burned by him and he will make egypt clean as a keeper of sheep makes clean his clothing and he will go out from there in peace
 and the stone pillars of beth shemesh in the land of egypt will be broken by him and the houses of the gods of egypt burned with fire
 the word which came to jeremiah about all the jews who were living in the land of egypt in migdol and at tahpanhes and at noph and in the country of pathros saying
 the lord of armies the god of israel has said you have seen all the evil which i have sent on jerusalem and on all the towns of judah and now this day they are waste and unpeopled
 because of the evil which they have done moving me to wrath by burning perfumes in worship to other gods who were not their gods or yours or the gods of their fathers
 and i sent all my servants the prophets to you getting up early and sending them saying do not do this disgusting thing which is hated by me
 but they gave no attention and their ears were not open so that they might be turned from their evil doing and from burning perfume to other gods
 because of this my passion and my wrath were let loose burning in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are waste and unpeopled as at this day
 so now the lord the god of armies the god of israel has said why are you doing this great evil against yourselves causing every man and woman little child and baby at the breast among you in judah to be cut off till not one is still living
 moving me to wrath with the work of your hands burning perfumes to other gods in the land of egypt where you have gone to make a place for yourselves so that you may become a curse and a name of shame among all the nations of the earth
 have you no memory of the evil doing of your fathers and the evil doing of the kings of judah and the evil doing of their wives and the evil which you yourselves have done and the evil which your wives have done in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
 even to this day their hearts are not broken and they have no fear and have not gone in the way of my law or of my rules which i gave to you and to your fathers
 so this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see my face will be turned against you for evil for the cutting off of all judah
 and i will take the last of judah whose minds are fixed on going into the land of egypt and stopping there and they will all come to their end falling in the land of egypt by the sword and by being short of food and by disease death will overtake them from the least to the greatest death by the sword and by need of food they will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame
 for i will send punishment on those who are living in the land of egypt as i have sent punishment on jerusalem by the sword and by need of food and by disease
 so that not one of the rest of judah who have gone into the land of egypt and are living there will get away or keep his life to come back to the land of judah where they are hoping to come back and be living again for not one will come back but only those who are able to get away
 then all the men who had knowledge that their wives were burning perfumes to other gods and all the women who were present a great meeting answering jeremiah said
 as for the word which you have said to us in the name of the lord we will not give ear to you
 but we will certainly do every word which has gone out of our mouths burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her as we did we and our fathers and our kings and our rulers in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then we had food enough and did well and saw no evil
 but from the time when we gave up burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her we have been in need of all things and have been wasted by the sword and by need of food
 and the women said when we were burning perfumes to the queen of heaven and draining out drink offerings to her did we make cakes in her image and give her our drink offerings without the knowledge of our husbands
 then jeremiah said to all the people to the men and women and all the people who had given him that answer
 the perfumes which you have been burning in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem you and your fathers and your kings and your rulers and the people of the land had the lord no memory of them and did he not keep them in mind
 and the lord was no longer able to put up with the evil of your doings and the disgusting things you did and because of this your land has become a waste and a cause of wonder and a curse with no one living in it as at this day
 because you have been burning perfumes and sinning against the lord and have not given ear to the voice of the lord or gone in the way of his law or his rules or his orders for this reason this evil has come on you as it is today
 further jeremiah said to all the people and all the women give ear to the word of the lord all those of judah who are living in egypt
 this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said you women have said with your mouths and with your hands you have done what you said we will certainly give effect to the oaths we have made to have perfumes burned to the queen of heaven and drink offerings drained out to her then give effect to your oaths and do them
 and now give ear to the word of the lord all you of judah who are living in the land of egypt truly i have taken an oath by my great name says the lord that my name is no longer to be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying by the life of the lord god
 see i am watching over them for evil and not for good all the men of judah who are in the land of egypt will be wasted by the sword and by need of food till there is an end of them
 and those who get away safe from the sword will come back from the land of egypt to the land of judah a very small number and all the rest of judah who have gone into the land of egypt and are living there will see whose word has effect mine or theirs
 and this will be the sign to you says the lord that i will give you punishment in this place so that you may see that my words will certainly have effect against you for evil
 the lord has said see i will give up pharaoh hophra king of egypt into the hands of those who are fighting against him and desiring to take his life as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his hater who had designs against his life
 the words which jeremiah the prophet said to baruch the son of neriah when he put these words down in a book from the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah he said
 this is what the lord the god of israel has said of you o baruch
 you said sorrow is mine  for the lord has given me sorrow in addition to my pain i am tired with the sound of my sorrow and i get no rest
 this is what you are to say to him the lord has said truly the building which i put up will be broken down and that which was planted by me will be uprooted and this through all the land
 and as for you are you looking for great things for yourself have no desire for them for truly i will send evil on all flesh says the lord but your life i will keep safe from attack wherever you go
 the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet about the nations
 of egypt about the army of pharaoh neco king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon overcame in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah
 get out the breastplate and body cover and come together to the fight
 make the horses ready and get up you horsemen and take your places with your head dresses make the spears sharp and put on the breastplates
 what have i seen they are overcome with fear and turned back their men of war are broken and have gone in flight not looking back fear is on every side says the lord
 let not the quick footed go in flight or the man of war get away on the north by the river euphrates they are slipping and falling
 who is this coming up like the nile whose waters are lifting their heads like the rivers
 egypt is coming up like the nile and his waters are lifting their heads like the rivers and he says i will go up covering the earth i will send destruction on the town and its people
 go up you horses go rushing on you carriages of war go out you men of war cush and put gripping the body cover and the ludim with bent bows
 but that day is the day of the lord the lord of armies a day of punishment when he will take payment from his haters and the sword will have all its desire drinking their blood in full measure for there is an offering to the lord the lord of armies in the north country by the river euphrates
 go up to gilead and take sweet oil o virgin daughter of egypt there is no help in all your medical arts nothing will make you well
 your shame has come to the ears of the nations and the earth is full of your cry for the strong man is falling against the strong they have come down together
 the word which the lord said to jeremiah the prophet of how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon would come and make war on the land of egypt
 give the news in migdol make it public in noph say take up your positions and make yourselves ready for on every side of you the sword has made destruction
 why has apis your strong one gone in flight he was not able to keep his place because the lord was forcing him down with strength
  are stopped in their going they are falling and they say one to another let us get up and go back to our people to the land of our birth away from the cruel sword
 give a name to pharaoh king of egypt a noise who has let the time go by
 by my life says the king whose name is the lord of armies truly like tabor among the mountains and like carmel by the sea so will he come
 o daughter living in egypt make ready the vessels of a prisoner for noph will become a waste it will be burned up and become unpeopled
 egypt is a fair young cow but a biting insect has come on her out of the north
 and those who were her fighters for payment are like fat oxen for they are turned back they have gone in flight together they do not keep their place for the day of their fate has come on them the time of their punishment
 she makes a sound like the hiss of a snake when they come on with strength they go against her with axes like wood cutters
 they will be cutting down her woods for they may not be searched out because they are like locusts more than may be numbered
 the daughter of egypt will be put to shame she will be given up into the hands of the people of the north
 the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send punishment on amon of no and on pharaoh and on those who put their faith in him
 and i will give them up into the hands of those who will take their lives and into the hands of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hands of his servants and later it will be peopled as in the past says the lord
 but have no fear o jacob my servant and do not be troubled o israel for see i will make you come back from far away and your seed from the land where they are prisoners and jacob will come back and will be quiet and in peace and no one will give him cause for fear
 have no fear o jacob my servant says the lord for i am with you for i will put an end to all the nations where i have sent you but i will not put an end to you completely though with wise purpose i will put right your errors and will not let you go quite without punishment
 the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet about the philistines before pharaohs attack on gaza
 this is what the lord has said see waters are coming up out of the north and will become an overflowing stream overflowing the land and everything in it the town and those who are living in it and men will give a cry and all the people of the land will be crying out in pain
 at the noise of the stamping of the feet of his war horses at the rushing of his carriages and the thunder of his wheels fathers will give no thought to their children because their hands are feeble
 because of the day which is coming with destruction on all the philistines cutting off from tyre and zidon the last of their helpers for the lord will send destruction on the philistines the rest of the sea land of caphtor
 the hair is cut off from the head of gaza ashkelon has come to nothing the last of the anakim are deeply wounding themselves
 o sword of the lord how long will you have no rest put yourself back into your cover be at peace be quiet
 how is it possible for it to be quiet seeing that the lord has given it orders against ashkelon and against the sea land he has given it directions
 of moab the lord of armies the god of israel has said sorrow on nebo for it has been made waste kiriathaim has been put to shame and is taken the strong place is put to shame and broken down
 the praise of moab has come to an end as for heshbon evil has been designed against her come let us put an end to her as a nation but your mouth will be shut o madmen the sword will go after you
 there is the sound of crying from horonaim wasting and great destruction
 moab is broken her cry has gone out to zoar
 for by the slope of luhith they will go up weeping all the way for on the way down to horonaim the cry of destruction has come to their ears
 go in flight get away with your lives and let your faces be turned to aroer in the arabah
 for because you have put your faith in your strong places you even you will be taken and chemosh will go out as a prisoner his priests and his rulers together
 and the attacker will come against every town not one will be safe and the valley will be made waste and destruction will come to the lowland as the lord has said
 put up a pillar for moab for she will come to a complete end and her towns will become a waste without anyone living in them
 let him be cursed who does the lords work half heartedly let him be cursed who keeps back his sword from blood
 from his earliest days moab has been living in comfort like wine long stored he has not been drained from vessel to vessel he has never gone away as a prisoner so his taste is still in him his smell is unchanged
 so truly the days are coming says the lord when i will send to him men who will have him turned over till there is no more wine in his vessels and his wine skins will be completely broken
 and moab will be shamed on account of chemosh as the children of israel were shamed on account of beth el their hope
 how say you we are men of war and strong fighters
 he who makes moab waste has gone up against her and the best of her young men have gone down to their death says the king whose name is the lord of armies
 the fate of moab is near and trouble is coming on him very quickly
 all you who are round about him give signs of grief for him and all you who have knowledge of his name say how is the strong rod broken even the beautiful branch 
 come down from your glory o people of dibon and take your seat in the place of the waste for the attacker of moab has gone up against you sending destruction on your strong places
 o daughter of aroer take your station by the way on the watch questioning him who is in flight and her who has got away safe say what has been done
 moab has been put to shame she is broken make loud sounds of grief crying out for help give the news in arnon that moab has been made waste
 and punishment has come on the lowlands on holon and jahzah and on mephaath
 and on dibon and on nebo and on beth diblathaim
 and on kiriathaim and on beth gamul and on beth meon
 and on kerioth and on bozrah and on all the towns of the land of moab far and near
 the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken says the lord
 make him full of wine for his heart has been lifted up against the lord and moab will be rolling in the food he was not able to keep down and everyone will be making sport of him
 for did you not make sport of israel was he taken among thieves for whenever you were talking about him you were shaking your head over him
 o people of moab go away from the towns and take cover in the rock be like the dove of the arabah which makes her living place in holes
 we have had word of the pride of moab how great it is how he is lifted up in pride and his great opinion of himself and that his heart is lifted up
 i have knowledge of his wrath says the lord that it is nothing his high sounding words have done nothing
 for this cause i will give cries of grief for moab crying out for moab even for all of it i will be sorrowing for the men of kir heres
 my weeping for you o vine of sibmah will be more than the weeping of jazer your branches have gone over the sea stretching even to jazer destruction has come down on your summer fruits and your cut grapes
 all joy is gone no longer are they glad for the fertile field and for the land of moab i have made the wine come to an end from the crushing vessels no longer will the grapes be crushed with the sound of glad voices
 the cry of heshbon comes even to elealeh to jahaz their voice is sounding from zoar even to horonaim and to eglath shelishiyah for the waters of nimrim will become dry
 and i will put an end in moab says the lord to him who is making offerings in the high place and burning perfumes to his gods
 so my heart is sounding for moab like the sound of pipes and my heart is sounding like pipes for the men of kir heres for the wealth he has got for himself has come to an end
 for everywhere the hair of the head and the hair of the face is cut off on every hand there are wounds and haircloth on every body
 on all the house tops of moab and in its streets there is weeping everywhere for moab has been broken like a vessel in which there is no pleasure says the lord
 how is it broken down  how is moabs back turned in shame  so moab will be a cause of sport and of fear to everyone round about him
 for the lord has said see he will come like an eagle in flight stretching out his wings against moab
 kerioth is taken and the strong places have been forced and the hearts of moabs men of war in that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth pains
 and moab will come to an end as a people because he has been lifting himself up against the lord
 fear and death and the net have come on you o people of moab says the lord
 he who goes in flight from the fear will be overtaken by death and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net for i will make this come on moab even the year of their punishment says the lord
 those who went in flight from the fear are waiting under the shade of heshbon for a fire has gone out from heshbon and a flame from the house of sihon burning up the pride of moab and the crown of the head of the violent ones
 sorrow is yours o moab  the people of chemosh are overcome for your sons have been taken away as prisoners and your daughters made servants
 but still i will let the fate of moab be changed in the last days says the lord
 about the children of ammon these are the words of the lord has israel no sons has he no one to take the heritage why then has milcom taken gad for himself putting his people in its towns
 because of this see the days are coming when i will have a cry of war sounded against rabbah the town of the children of ammon it will become a waste of broken walls and her daughter towns will be burned with fire then israel will take the heritage of those who took his heritage says the lord
 make sounds of grief o heshbon for ai is wasted give loud cries o daughters of rabbah and put haircloth round you give yourselves to weeping running here and there and wounding yourselves for milcom will be taken prisoner together with his rulers and his priests
 why are you lifted up in pride on account of your valleys your flowing valley o daughter ever turning away who puts her faith in her wealth saying who will come against me
 see i will send fear on you says the lord the lord of armies from those who are round you on every side you will be forced out every man straight before him and there will be no one to get together the wanderers
 but after these things i will let the fate of the children of ammon be changed says the lord
 about edom this is what the lord of armies has said is there no more wisdom in teman have wise suggestions come to an end among men of good sense has their wisdom completely gone
 go in flight go back take cover in deep places you who are living in dedan for i will send the fate of edom on him even the time of his punishment
 if men came to get your grapes would they not let some be uncut on the vines if thieves came by night would they not make waste till they had enough
 i have had esau searched out uncovering his secret places so that he may not keep himself covered his seed is wasted and has come to an end and there is no help from his neighbours
 put in my care your children who have no father and i will keep them safe and let your widows put their faith in me
 for the lord has said those for whom the cup was not made ready will certainly be forced to take of it and are you to go without punishment you will not be without punishment but will certainly be forced to take from the cup
 for i have taken an oath by myself says the lord that bozrah will become a cause of wonder a name of shame a waste and a curse and all its towns will be waste places for ever
 word has come to me from the lord and a representative has been sent to the nations to say come together and go up against her and take your places for the fight
 for see i have made you small among the nations looked down on by men
  the pride of your heart has been a false hope o you who are living in the cracks of the rock keeping your place on the top of the hill even if you made your living place as high as the eagle i would make you come down says the lord
 and edom will become a cause of wonder everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of fear at all her punishments
 as at the downfall of sodom and gomorrah and their neighbouring towns says the lord no man will be living in it no son of man will have a resting place there
 see he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of jordan against the resting place of teman but i will suddenly make him go in flight from her and i will put over her the man of my selection for who is like me and who will put forward his cause against me and what keeper of sheep will be able to keep his place before me
 for this cause give ear to the decision of the lord which he has made against edom and to his purposes designed against the people of teman truly they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock truly he will make waste their fields with them
 the earth is shaking with the noise of their fall their cry is sounding in the red sea
 see he will come up like an eagle in flight stretching out his wings against bozrah and the hearts of edoms men of war on that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth pains
 about damascus hamath is put to shame and arpad for the word of evil has come to their ears their heart in its fear is turned to water it will not be quiet
 damascus has become feeble she is turned to flight fear has taken her in its grip pain and sorrows have come on her as on a woman in birth pains
 how has the town of praise been wasted the place of joy 
 so her young men will be falling in her streets and all the men of war will be cut off in that day says the lord of armies
 and i will have a fire lighted on the wall of damascus burning up the great houses of ben hadad
 about kedar and the kingdoms of hazor which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon overcame this is what the lord has said up  go against kedar and make an attack on the children of the east
 their tents and their flocks they will take they will take away for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels they will give a cry to them fear on every side
 go in flight go wandering far off take cover in deep places o people of hazor says the lord for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon has made a design against you he has a purpose against you in mind
 up  go against a nation which is living in comfort and without fear of danger says the lord without doors or locks living by themselves
 and their camels will be taken from them by force and their great herds will come into the hands of their attackers those who have the ends of their hair cut i will send in flight to all the winds and i will send their fate on them from every side says the lord
 and hazor will be a hole for jackals a waste for ever no one will be living in it and no son of man will have a resting place there
 the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet about elam when zedekiah first became king of judah saying
 this is what the lord of armies has said see i will have the bow of elam their chief strength broken
 and i will send on elam four winds from the four quarters of heaven driving them out to all those winds there will be no nation into which the wanderers from elam do not come
 and i will let elam be broken before their haters and before those who are making designs against their lives i will send evil on them even my burning wrath says the lord and i will send the sword after them till i have put an end to them
 i will put the seat of my power in elam and in elam i will put an end to kings and rulers says the lord
 but it will come about that in the last days i will let the fate of elam be changed says the lord
 go quickly through the streets of jerusalem and see now and get knowledge and make a search in her wide places if there is a man if there is one in her who is upright who keeps faith and she will have my forgiveness
 and though they say by the living lord truly their oaths are false
 o lord do not your eyes see good faith you have given them punishment but they were not troubled you have sent destruction on them but they did not take your teaching to heart they have made their faces harder than a rock they would not come back
 then i said but these are the poor they are foolish for they have no knowledge of the way of the lord or of the behaviour desired by their god
 i will go to the great men and have talk with them for they have knowledge of the way of the lord and of the behaviour desired by their god but as for these their one purpose is a broken yoke and burst bands
 and so a lion from the woods will put them to death a wolf of the waste land will make them waste a leopard will keep watch on their towns and everyone who goes out from them will be food for the beasts because of the great number of their sins and the increase of their wrongdoing
 how is it possible for you to have my forgiveness for this your children have given me up taking their oaths by those who are no gods when i had given them food in full measure they were false to their wives taking their pleasure in the houses of loose women
 they were full of desire like horses after a meal of grain everyone went after his neighbours wife
 am i not to give punishment for these things says the lord will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this
 go up against her vines and make waste let the destruction be complete take away her branches for they are not the lords
 for the people of israel and the people of judah have been very false to me says the lord
 they would have nothing to do with the lord saying he will do nothing and no evil will come to us we will not see the sword or be short of food
 and the prophets will become wind and the word is not in them so it will be done to them
 for this reason the lord the god of armies has said because you have said this i will make my words in your mouth a fire and this people wood and they will be burned up by it
 see i will send you a nation from far away o people of israel says the lord a strong nation and an old nation a nation whose language is strange to you so that you may not get the sense of their words
 their arrows give certain death they are all men of war
 they will take all the produce of your fields which would have been food for your sons and your daughters they will take your flocks and your herds they will take all your vines and your fig trees and with the sword they will make waste your walled towns in which you put your faith
 but even in those days says the lord i will not let your destruction be complete
 and it will come about when you say why has the lord our god done all these things to us that you will say to them as you gave me up making yourselves servants to strange gods in your land so will you be servants to strange men in a land which is not yours
 say this openly in jacob and give it out in judah saying
 give ear now to this o foolish people without sense who have eyes but see nothing and ears without the power of hearing
 have you no fear of me says the lord will you not be shaking with fear before me who have put the sand as a limit for the sea by an eternal order so that it may not go past it and though it is ever in motion it is not able to have its way though the sound of its waves is loud they are not able to go past it
 but the heart of this people is uncontrolled and turned away from me they are broken loose and gone
 and they do not say in their hearts now let us give worship to our god who gives the rain the winter and the spring rain at the right time who keeps for us the ordered weeks of the grain cutting
 through your evil doing these things have been turned away and your sins have kept back good from you
 for there are sinners among my people they keep watch like men watching for birds they put a net and take men in it
 as the fowl house is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit for this reason they have become great and have got wealth
 they have become fat and strong they have gone far in works of evil they give no support to the cause of the child without a father so that they may do well they do not see that the poor man gets his rights
 am i not to give punishment for these things says the lord will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this
 a thing of wonder and fear has come about in the land
 the prophets give false words and the priests give decisions by their direction and my people are glad to have it so and what will you do in the end
 the word which the lord said about babylon about the land of the chaldaeans by jeremiah the prophet
 give it out among the nations make it public and let the flag be lifted up give the word and keep nothing back say babylon is taken bel is put to shame merodach is broken her images are put to shame her gods are broken
 for out of the north a nation is coming up against her which will make her land waste and unpeopled they are in flight man and beast are gone
 in those days and in that time says the lord the children of israel will come they and the children of judah together they will go on their way weeping and making prayer to the lord their god
 they will be questioning about the way to zion with their faces turned in its direction saying come and be united to the lord in an eternal agreement which will be kept in mind for ever
 my people have been wandering sheep their keepers have made them go out of the right way turning them loose on the mountains they have gone from mountain to hill having no memory of their resting place
 they have been attacked by all those who came across them and their attackers said we are doing no wrong because they have done evil against the lord in whom is righteousness against the lord the hope of their fathers
 go in flight out of babylon go out of the land of the chaldaeans and be like he goats before the flocks
 for see i am moving and sending up against babylon a band of great nations from the north country and they will put their armies in position against her and from there she will be taken their arrows will be like those of an expert man of war not one will come back without getting its mark
 and the wealth of chaldaea will come into the hands of her attackers all those who take her wealth will have enough says the lord
 because you are glad because you are lifted up with pride you wasters of my heritage because you are playing like a young cow put out to grass and you make a noise like strong horses
 your mother will be put to shame she who gave you birth will be looked down on see she will be the last of the nations a waste place a dry and unwatered land
 because of the wrath of the lord no one will be living in it and it will be quite unpeopled everyone who goes by babylon will be overcome with wonder and make sounds of fear at all her punishments
 put your armies in position against babylon on every side all you bowmen let loose your arrows at her not keeping any back for she has done evil against the lord
 give a loud cry against her on every side she has given herself up her supports are overturned her walls are broken down for it is the payment taken by the lord give her payment as she has done so do to her
 let the planter of seed be cut off from babylon and everyone using the curved blade at the time of the grain cutting for fear of the cruel sword everyone will be turned to his people everyone will go in flight to his land
 israel is a wandering sheep the lions have been driving him away first he was attacked by the king of assyria and now his bones have been broken by nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
 so this is what the lord of armies the god of israel has said see i will send punishment on the king of babylon and on his land as i have given punishment to the king of assyria
 and i will make israel come back to his resting place and he will get his food on carmel and bashan and have his desire in full measure on the hills of ephraim and in gilead
 in those days and in that time says the lord when the evil doing of israel is looked for there will be nothing and in judah no sins will be seen for i will have forgiveness for those whom i will keep safe
 go up against the land of merathaim even against it and against the people of pekod put them to death and send destruction after them says the lord and do everything i have given you orders to do
 there is a sound of war in the land and of great destruction
 how is the hammer of all the earth cut in two and broken  how has babylon become a waste among the nations 
 i have put a net for you and you have been taken o babylon without your knowledge you have been uncovered and taken because you were fighting against the lord
 from his store house the lord has taken the instruments of his wrath for the lord the lord of armies has a work to do in the land of the chaldaeans
 come up against her one and all let her store houses be broken open make her into a mass of stones give her to the curse till there is nothing of her to be seen
 put all her oxen to the sword let them go down to death sorrow is theirs for their day has come the time of their punishment
 the voice of those who are in flight who have got away safe from the land of babylon to give news in zion of punishment from the lord our god even payment for his temple
 send for the archers to come together against babylon all the bowmen put up your tents against her on every side let no one get away give her the reward of her work as she has done so do to her for she has been uplifted in pride against the lord against the holy one of israel
 for this cause her young men will be falling in her streets and all her men of war will be cut off in that day says the lord
 see i am against you o pride says the lord the lord of armies for your day has come the time when i will send punishment on you
 and pride will go with uncertain steps and have a fall and there will be no one to come to his help and i will put a fire in his towns burning up everything round about him
 this is what the lord of armies has said the children of israel and the children of judah are crushed down together all those who took them prisoner keep them in a tight grip they will not let them go
 their saviour is strong the lord of armies is his name he will certainly take up their cause so that he may give rest to the earth and trouble to the people of babylon
 a sword is on the chaldaeans says the lord and on the people of babylon and on her rulers and on her wise men
 a sword is on the men of pride and they will become foolish a sword is on her men of war and they will be broken
 a sword is on all the mixed people in her and they will become like women a sword is on her store houses and they will be taken by her attackers
 a sword is on her waters drying them up for it is a land of images and their minds are fixed on false gods
 for this reason the beasts of the waste land with the wolves will make their holes there and the ostriches will be living in it never again will men be living there it will be unpeopled from generation to generation
 as when sodom and gomorrah and their neighbouring towns were overturned by god says the lord so no man will be living in it and no son of man will have a resting place there
 see a people is coming from the north a great nation and a number of kings will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth
 bows and spears are in their hands they are cruel and have no mercy their voice is like the thunder of the sea and they go on horses everyone in his place like men going to the fight against you o daughter of babylon
 the king of babylon has had news of them and his hands have become feeble trouble has come on him and pain like the pain of a woman in childbirth
 see he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of jordan against the resting place of teman but i will suddenly make them go in flight from her and i will put over her the man of my selection for who is like me and who will put forward his cause against me and what keeper of sheep will keep his place before me
 so give ear to the decision of the lord which he has made against babylon and to his purposes designed against the land of the chaldaeans truly they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock truly he will make waste their fields with them
 at the cry babylon is taken  the earth is shaking and the cry comes to the ears of the nations
 the lord has said see i will make a wind of destruction come up against babylon and against those who are living in chaldaea
 and i will send men to babylon to make her clean and get her land cleared for in the day of trouble they will put up their tents against her on every side
 against her the bow of the archer is bent and he puts on his coat of metal have no mercy on her young men give all her army up to the curse
 and the dead will be stretched out in the land of the chaldaeans and the wounded in her streets
 for israel has not been given up or judah by his god by the lord of armies for their land is full of sin against the holy one of israel
 go in flight out of babylon so that every man may keep his life do not be cut off in her evil doing for it is the time of the lords punishment he will give her her reward
 babylon has been a gold cup in the hand of the lord which has made all the earth overcome with wine the nations have taken of her wine and for this cause the nations have gone off their heads
 sudden is the downfall of babylon and her destruction make cries of grief for her take sweet oil for her pain if it is possible for her to be made well
 we would have made babylon well but she is not made well give her up and let us go everyone to his country for her punishment is stretching up to heaven and lifted up even to the skies
 the lord has made clear our righteousness come and let us give an account in zion of the work of the lord our god
 make bright the arrows take up the body covers the lord has been moving the spirit of the king of the medes because his design against babylon is its destruction for it is the punishment from the lord the payment for his temple
 let the flag be lifted up against the walls of babylon make the watch strong put the watchmen in their places make ready a surprise attack for it is the lords purpose and he has done what he said about the people of babylon
 o you whose living place is by the wide waters whose stores are great your end is come your evil profit is ended
 the lord of armies has taken an oath by himself saying truly i will make you full with men as with locusts and their voices will be loud against you
 he has made the earth by his power he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out
 at the sound of his voice there is a massing of the waters in the heavens and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth he makes the thunder flames for the rain and sends out the wind from his store houses
 then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge every gold worker is put to shame by the image he has made for his metal image is deceit and there is no breath in them
 they are nothing a work of error in the time of their punishment destruction will overtake them
 the heritage of jacob is not like these for the maker of all things is his heritage the lord of armies is his name
 you are my fighting axe and my instrument of war with you the nations will be broken with you kingdoms will be broken
 with you the horse and the horseman will be broken with you the war carriage and he who goes in it will be broken
 with you man and woman will be broken with you the old man and the boy will be broken with you the young man and the virgin will be broken
 with you the keeper of sheep with his flock will be broken and with you the farmer and his oxen will be broken and with you captains and rulers will be broken
 and i will give to babylon and to all the people of chaldaea their reward for all the evil they have done in zion before your eyes says the lord
 see i am against you says the lord o mountain of destruction causing the destruction of all the earth and my hand will be stretched out on you rolling you down from the rocks and making you a burned mountain
 and they will not take from you a stone for the angle of a wall or the base of a building but you will be a waste place for ever says the lord
 let a flag be lifted up in the land let the horn be sounded among the nations make the nations ready against her get the kingdoms of ararat minni and ashkenaz together against her make ready a scribe against her let the horses come up against her like massed locusts
 make the nations ready for war against her the king of the medes and his rulers and all his captains and all the land under his rule
 and the land is shaking and in pain for the purposes of the lord are fixed to make the land of babylon an unpeopled waste
 babylons men of war have kept back from the fight waiting in their strong places their strength has given way they have become like women her houses have been put on fire her locks are broken
 one man running will give word to another and one who goes with news will be handing it on to another to give word to the king of babylon that his town has been taken from every quarter
 and the ways across the river have been taken and the water holes  burned with fire and the men of war are in the grip of fear
 for these are the words of the lord of armies the god of israel the daughter of babylon is like a grain floor when it is stamped down before long the time of her grain cutting will come
 nebuchadrezzar king of babylon has made a meal of me violently crushing me he has made me a vessel with nothing in it he has taken me in his mouth like a dragon he has made his stomach full with my delicate flesh crushing me with his teeth
 may the violent things done to me and my downfall come on babylon the daughter of zion will say and may my blood be on the people of chaldaea jerusalem will say
 for this reason the lord has said see i will give support to your cause and take payment for what you have undergone i will make her sea dry and her fountain without water
 and babylon will become a mass of broken walls a hole for jackals a cause of wonder and surprise without a living man in it
 they will be crying out together like lions their voices will be like the voices of young lions
 when they are heated i will make a feast for them and overcome them with wine so that they may become unconscious sleeping an eternal sleep without awaking says the lord
 i will make them go down to death like lambs like he goats together
 how is babylon taken  and the praise of all the earth surprised  how has babylon become a cause of wonder among the nations 
 the sea has come up over babylon she is covered with the mass of its waves
 her towns have become a waste a dry and unwatered land where no man has his living place and no son of man goes by
 and i will send punishment on bel in babylon and take out of his mouth what went into it no longer will the nations be flowing together to him truly the wall of babylon will come down
 my people go out from her and let every man get away safe from the burning wrath of the lord
 so that your hearts may not become feeble and full of fear because of the news which will go about in the land for a story will go about one year and after that in another year another story and violent acts in the land ruler against ruler
 for this cause truly the days are coming when i will send punishment on the images of babylon and all her land will be shamed and her dead will be falling down in her
 and the heaven and the earth and everything in them will make a song of joy over babylon for those who make her waste will come from the north says the lord
 as babylon had the dead of israel put to the sword so in babylon the dead of all the land will be stretched out
 you who have got away safe from the sword go waiting for nothing have the lord in memory when you are far away and keep jerusalem in mind
 we are shamed because bitter words have come to our ears our faces are covered with shame for men from strange lands have come into the holy places of the lords house
 for this reason see the days are coming says the lord when i will send punishment on her images and through all her land the wounded will be crying out in pain
 even if babylon was lifted up to heaven even if she had the high places of her strength shut in with walls still i would send against her those who will make her waste says the lord
 there is the sound of a cry from babylon and of a great destruction from the land of the chaldaeans
 for the lord is making babylon waste and putting an end to the great voice coming out of her and her waves are thundering like great waters their voice is sounding loud
 for the waster has come on her even on babylon and her men of war are taken their bows are broken for the lord is a rewarding god and he will certainly give payment
 and i will make her chiefs and her wise men her rulers and her captains and her men of war overcome with wine their sleep will be an eternal sleep without awaking says the king the lord of armies is his name
 the lord of armies has said the wide walls of babylon will be completely uncovered and her high doorways will be burned with fire so peoples keep on working for nothing and the weariness of nations comes to an end in the smoke
 the order which jeremiah the prophet gave to seraiah the son of neriah the son of mahseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of judah to babylon in the fourth year of his rule now seraiah was the chief controller of the house
 and jeremiah put in a book all the evil which was to come on babylon
 and jeremiah said to seraiah when you come to babylon see that you give them all these words
 and after reading them say o lord you have said about this place that it is to be cut off so that no one will be living in it not a man or a beast but it will be unpeopled for ever
 and it will be that when you have come to an end of reading this book you are to have a stone fixed to it and have it dropped into the euphrates
 and you are to say so babylon will go down never to be lifted up again because of the evil which i will send on her and weariness will overcome them so far these are the words of jeremiah
 zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king he was king for eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
 and he did evil in the eyes of the lord as jehoiakim had done
 and because of the wrath of the lord this came about in jerusalem and judah till he had sent them away from before him and zedekiah took up arms against the king of babylon
 and in the ninth year of his rule on the tenth day of the tenth month nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came against jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it building earthworks all round it
 so the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of king zedekiah
 in the fourth month on the ninth day of the month the store of food in the town was almost gone so that there was no food for the people of the land
 then an opening was made in the wall of the town and all the men of war went in flight out of the town by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the kings garden  now the chaldaeans were stationed round the town  and they went by the way of the arabah
 and the chaldaean army went after king zedekiah and overtook him on the other side of jericho and all his army went in flight from him in every direction
 then they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath to be judged
 and the king of babylon put the sons of zedekiah to death before his eyes and he put to death all the rulers of judah in riblah
 and he put out zedekiahs eyes and the king of babylon chaining him in iron bands took him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death
 now in the fifth month on the tenth day of the month in the nineteenth year of king nebuchadrezzar king of babylon nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men a servant of the king of babylon came into jerusalem
 and he had the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great house burned with fire
 and the walls round jerusalem were broken down by the chaldaean army which was with the captain
 then nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away as prisoners the rest of the people who were still in the town and those who had given themselves up to the king of babylon and the rest of the workmen
 but nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men let the poorest of the land go on living there to take care of the vines and the fields
 and the brass pillars which were in the house of the lord and the wheeled bases and the great brass water vessel in the house of the lord were broken up by the chaldaeans who took all the brass away to babylon
 and the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons and all the brass vessels used in the lords house they took away
 and the cups and the fire trays and the basins and the pots and the supports for the lights and the spoons and the wide basins the gold of the gold vessels and the silver of the silver vessels the captain of the armed men took away
 the two pillars the great water vessel and the twelve brass oxen which were under it and the ten wheeled bases which king solomon had made for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight
 and as for the pillars one pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits measured all round and it was as thick as a mans hand it was hollow
 and there was a crown of brass on it the crown was five cubits high circled with a network and apples all of brass and the second pillar had the same
 there were ninety six apples on the outside the number of apples all round the network was a hundred
 and the captain of the armed men took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three door keepers
 and from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war and seven of the kings near friends who were in the town and the scribe of the captain of the army who was responsible for getting the people of the land together in military order and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town
 these nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took with him to the king of babylon at riblah
 and the king of babylon put them to death at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was taken prisoner away from his land
 these are the people whom nebuchadrezzar took away prisoner in the seventh year three thousand and twenty three jews
 and in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he took away as prisoners from jerusalem eight hundred and thirty two persons
 in the twenty third year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the captain of the armed men took away as prisoners seven hundred and forty five of the jews all the persons were four thousand and six hundred
 and in the thirty seventh year after jehoiachin king of judah had been taken prisoner in the twelfth month on the twenty fifth day of the month evil merodach king of babylon in the first year after he became king took jehoiachin king of judah out of prison
 and he said kind words to him and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in babylon
 and his prison clothing was changed and he was a guest at the kings table every day for the rest of his life
 and for his food the king gave him a regular amount every day till the day of his death for the rest of his life
 go in flight out of jerusalem so that you may be safe you children of benjamin and let the horn be sounded in tekoa and the flag be lifted up on beth haccherem for evil is looking out from the north and a great destruction
 the fair and delicate one the daughter of zion will be cut off by my hand
 keepers of sheep with their flocks will come to her they will put up their tents round her everyone will get food in his place
 make war ready against her up  let us go up when the sun is high sorrow is ours  for the day is turned and the shades of evening are stretched out
 up  let us go up by night and send destruction on her great houses
 for this is what the lord of armies has said let trees be cut down and an earthwork be placed against jerusalem sorrow on the false town  inside her there is nothing but cruel ways
 as the spring keeps its waters cold so she keeps her evil in her the sound of cruel and violent behaviour is in her before me at all times are disease and wounds
 undergo teaching o jerusalem or my soul will be turned away from you and i will make you a waste an unpeopled land
 this is what the lord of armies has said everything will be taken from the rest of israel as the last grapes are taken from the vine let your hand be turned to the small branches like one pulling off grapes
 to whom am i to give word witnessing so that they may take note see their ears are stopped and they are not able to give attention see the word of the lord has been a cause of shame to them they have no delight in it
 for this reason i am full of the wrath of the lord i am tired of keeping it in may it be let loose on the children in the street and on the band of the young men together for even the husband with his wife will be taken the old man with him who is full of days
 and their houses will be handed over to others their fields and their wives together for my hand will be stretched out against the people of the land says the lord
 for from the least of them even to the greatest everyone is given up to getting money from the prophet even to the priest everyone is working deceit
 and they have made little of the wounds of my people saying peace peace when there is no peace
 let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things they had no shame they were not able to become red with shame so they will come down with those who are falling when my punishment comes on them they will be made low says the lord
 this is what the lord has said take your place looking out on the ways make search for the old roads saying where is the good way and go in it that you may have rest for your souls but they said we will not go in it
 and i put watchmen over you saying give attention to the sound of the horn but they said we will not give attention
 so then give ear you nations and 
 give ear o earth see i will make evil come on this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not given attention to my words and they would have nothing to do with my law
 to what purpose does sweet perfume come to me from sheba and spices from a far country your burned offerings give me no pleasure your offerings of beasts are not pleasing to me
 for this reason the lord has said see i will put stones in the way of this people and the fathers and the sons together will go falling over them the neighbour and his friend will come to destruction
 the lord has said see a people is coming from the north country a great nation will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth
 bows and spears are in their hands they are cruel and have no mercy their voice is like the thunder of the sea and they go on horses everyone in his place like men going to the fight against you o daughter of zion
 the news of it has come to our ears our hands have become feeble trouble has come on us and pain like the pain of a woman in childbirth
 go not out into the field or by the way for there is the sword of the attacker and fear on every side
 o daughter of my people put on haircloth rolling yourself in the dust give yourself to sorrow as for an only son with most bitter cries of grief for he who makes waste will come on us suddenly
 i have made you a tester among my people so that you may have knowledge of their way and put it to the test
 all of them are turned away going about with false stories they are brass and iron they are all workers of deceit
 the blower is blowing strongly the lead is burned away in the fire they go on heating the metal to no purpose for the evil doers are not taken away
 they will be named waste silver because the lord has given them up
 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
 take your place in the doorway of the lords house and give out this word there and say give ear to the word of the lord all you of judah who come inside these doors to give worship to the lord
 the lord of armies the god of israel says let your ways and your doings be changed for the better and i will let you go on living in this place
 put no faith in false words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these
 for if your ways and your doings are truly changed for the better if you truly give right decisions between a man and his neighbour
 if you are not cruel to the man from a strange country and to the child without a father and to the widow and do not put the upright to death in this place or go after other gods causing damage to yourselves
 then i will let you go on living in this place in the land which i gave to your fathers in the past and for ever
 see you put your faith in false words which are of no profit
 will you take the goods of others put men to death and be untrue to your wives and take false oaths and have perfumes burned to the baal and go after other gods which are strange to you
 and come and take your place before me in this house which is named by my name and say we have been made safe so that you may do all these disgusting things
 has this house which is named by my name become a hole of thieves to you truly i even i have seen it says the lord
 but go now to my place which was in shiloh where i put my name at first and see what i did to it because of the evil doing of my people israel
 and now because you have done all these works says the lord and i sent my word to you getting up early and sending but you did not give ear and my voice came to you but you gave no answer
 for this reason i will do to the house which is named by my name and in which you have put your faith and to the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh
 and i will send you away from before my face as i have sent away all your brothers even all the seed of ephraim
 and as for you  jeremiah  make no prayers for this people send up no cry or prayer for them make no request for them to me for i will not give ear
 do you not see what they are doing in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem
 the children go for wood the fathers get the fire burning the women are working the paste to make cakes for the queen of heaven and drink offerings are drained out to other gods moving me to wrath
 are they moving me to wrath says the lord are they not moving themselves to their shame
 so this is what the lord god has said see my wrath and my passion will be let loose on this place on man and beast and on the trees of the field and on the produce of the earth it will be burning and will not be put out
 these are the words of the lord of armies the god of israel put your burned offerings with your offerings of beasts and take flesh for your food
 for i said nothing to your fathers and gave them no orders on the day when i took them out of egypt about burned offerings or offerings of beasts
 but this was the order i gave them saying give ear to my voice and i will be your god and you will be my people go in all the way ordered by me so that all may be well for you
 but they took no note and did not give ear but were guided by the thoughts and the pride of their evil hearts going back and not forward
 from the day when your fathers came out of egypt till this day i have sent my servants the prophets to you getting up early every day and sending them
 but still they took no note and would not give ear but they made their necks stiff doing worse than their fathers
 and you are to say all these words to them but they will not give ear to you you will send out your voice to them but they will give no answer
 and you are to say to them this is the nation which has not given ear to the voice of their god or taken his teaching to heart good faith is dead and is cut off from their mouths
 let your hair be cut off o jerusalem and let it go and let a song of grief go up on the open hilltops for the lord is turned away from the generation of his wrath and has given them up
 for the children of judah have done what is evil in my eyes says the lord they have put their disgusting images in the house which is named by my name making it unclean
 and they have put up the high place of topheth in the valley of the son of hinnom burning their sons and their daughters there in the fire a thing which was not ordered by me and never came into my mind
 for this cause the days are coming says the lord when it will no longer be named topheth or the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of death for they will put the dead into the earth in topheth till there is no more room
 and the bodies of this people will be food for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth and there will be no one to send them away
 and in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem i will put an end to the laughing voices the voice of joy and the voice of the newly married man and the voice of the bride for the land will become a waste
 at that time says the lord they will take the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his rulers and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the people of jerusalem out of their resting places
 and they will put them out before the sun and the moon and all the stars of heaven whose lovers and servants they have been after whom they have gone to whom they have made prayers and to whom they have given worship they will not be put together or placed in the earth they will be waste on the face of the earth
 and death will be desired more than life by the rest of this evil family who are still living in all the places where i have sent them away says the lord of armies
 further you are to say to them this is what the lord has said will those who are falling not be lifted up again will he who has gone away not come back
 why do these people of jerusalem go back for ever turning away they will not give up their deceit they will not come back
 i took note and gave ear but no one said what is right no man had regret for his evil doing saying what have i done everyone goes off on his way like a horse rushing to the fight
 truly the stork in the heavens is conscious of her fixed times the dove and the swallow and the crane keep to the times of their coming but my people have no knowledge of the law of the lord
 how is it that you say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us but see the false pen of the scribes has made it false
 the wise men are shamed they are overcome with fear and taken see they have given up the word of the lord and what use is their wisdom to them
 so i will give their wives to others and their fields to those who will take them for themselves for everyone from the least to the greatest is given up to getting money from the priest even to the prophet everyone is false
 and they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of zion saying peace peace when there is no peace
 let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things they had no shame they were not able to become red with shame so they will come down with those who are falling in the time of their punishment they will be made low says the lord
 i will put an end to them completely says the lord there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig tree and the leaf is dry
 why are we seated doing nothing come together and let us go to the walled towns and let destruction overtake us there for the lord our god has sent destruction on us and given us bitter water for our drink because we have done evil against the lord
 we were looking for peace but no good came and for a time of well being but there is only a great fear
 the loud breathing of the horses comes to our ears from dan at the sound of the outcry of his war horses all the land is shaking with fear for they have come and have made a meal of the land and everything in it the town and the people living in it
 see i will send snakes and poison snakes among you against which the wonder worker has no power and they will give you wounds which may not be made well says the lord
 sorrow has come on me  my heart in me is feeble
 the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people comes from a far land is the lord not in zion is not her king in her why have they made me angry with their images and their strange gods which are no gods
 the grain cutting is past the summer is ended and no salvation has come to us
 for the destruction of the daughter of my people i am broken i am dressed in the clothing of grief fear has taken me in its grip
 is there no life giving oil in gilead is there no expert in medical arts why then have my people not been made well
 if only my head was a stream of waters and my eyes fountains of weeping so that i might go on weeping day and night for the dead of the daughter of my people 
 if only i had in the waste land a nights resting place for travellers so that i might go away far from my people  for they are all untrue a band of false men
 their tongues are bent like a bow to send out false words they have become strong in the land but not for good faith they go on from evil to evil and they have no knowledge of me says the lord
 let everyone keep watch on his neighbour and put no faith in any brother for every brother will certainly be tricking his brother and every neighbour will go about saying evil
 everyone will make sport of his neighbour with deceit not saying what is true their tongues have been trained to say false words they are twisted hating to come back
 there is wrong on wrong deceit on deceit they have given up the knowledge of me says the lord
 so the lord of armies has said see i will make them soft in the fire and put them to the test this i will do because of their evil doing
 his tongue is an arrow causing death the words of his mouth are deceit he says words of peace to his neighbour but in his heart he is waiting secretly for him
 am i not to send punishment for these things says the lord will not my soul take payment from such a nation as this
 give yourselves to weeping crying out in sorrow for the mountains and for the fields of the waste land send up a song of grief because they are burned up so that no one goes through there is no sound of cattle the bird of the heavens and the beast are in flight and are gone
 and i will make jerusalem a mass of broken stones the living place of jackals and i will make the towns of judah a waste with no man living there
 who is the wise man able to see this who is he to whom the word of the lord has come so that he may make it clear why is the land given to destruction and burned up like a waste place so that no one goes through
 and the lord said because they have given up my law which i put before them giving no attention to my voice and not being guided by it
 but they have been walking in the pride of their hearts going after the baals as their fathers gave them teaching
 so the lord of armies the god of israel has said i will give them even this people bitter plants for food and bitter water for drink
 and i will send them wandering among the nations among people strange to them and to their fathers and i will send the sword after them till i have put an end to them
 this is what the lord of armies has said take thought and send for the weeping women so that they may come and send for the wise women so that they may come
 let them quickly make cries of sorrow for us so that drops may be flowing from our eyes till they are streaming with water
 for a sound of weeping goes up from zion a cry how has destruction come on us we are overcome with shame because we have gone away from our land he has sent us out from our house
 but even now give ear to the word of the lord o you women let your ears be open to the word of his mouth training your daughters to give cries of sorrow everyone teaching her neighbour a song of grief
 for death has come up into our windows forcing its way into our great houses cutting off the children in the streets and the young men in the wide places
 the bodies of men will be falling like waste on the open fields and like grain dropped by the grain cutter and no one will take them up
 this is the word of the lord let not the wise man take pride in his wisdom or the strong man in his strength or the man of wealth in his wealth
 but if any man has pride let it be in this that he has the wisdom to have knowledge of me that i am the lord working mercy giving true decisions and doing righteousness in the earth for in these things i have delight says the lord
 see the day is coming says the lord when i will send punishment on all those who have circumcision in the flesh
 on egypt and on judah and on edom and on the children of ammon and on moab and on all who have the ends of their hair cut who are living in the waste land for all these nations and all the people of israel are without circumcision in their hearts
 there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job he was without sin and upright fearing god and keeping himself far from evil
 and he had seven sons and three daughters
 and of cattle he had seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and a thousand oxen and five hundred she asses and a very great number of servants and the man was greater than any of the sons of the east
 his sons regularly went to one anothers houses and every one on his day gave a feast and at these times they sent for their three sisters to take part in their feasts with them
 and at the end of their days of feasting job sent and made them clean getting up early in the morning and offering burned offerings for them all for job said it may be that my sons have done wrong and said evil of god in their hearts and job did this whenever the feasts came round
 and there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the lord and the satan came with them
 and the lord said to the satan where do you come from and the satan said in answer from wandering this way and that on the earth and walking about on it
 and the lord said to the satan have you taken note of my servant job for there is no one like him on the earth a man without sin and upright fearing god and keeping himself far from evil
 and the satan said in answer to the lord is it for nothing that job is a god fearing man
 have you yourself not put a wall round him and his house and all he has on every side blessing the work of his hands and increasing his cattle in the land
 but now put out your hand against all he has and he will be cursing you to your face
 and the lord said to the satan see i give all he has into your hands only do not put a finger on the man himself and the satan went out from before the lord
 and there was a day when his sons and daughters were feasting in the house of their oldest brother
 and a man came to job and said the oxen were ploughing and the asses were taking their food by their side
 and the men of sheba came against them and took them away putting the young men to the sword and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
 and this one was still talking when another came and said the fire of god came down from heaven burning up the sheep and the goats and the young men completely and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
 and this one was still talking when another came and said the chaldaeans made themselves into three bands and came down on the camels and took them away putting the young men to the sword and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
 and this one was still talking when another came and said your sons and your daughters were feasting together in their oldest brothers house
 when a great wind came rushing from the waste land against the four sides of the house and it came down on the young men and they are dead and i was the only one who got away safe to give you the news
 then job got up and after parting his clothing and cutting off his hair he went down on his face to the earth and gave worship and said
 with nothing i came out of my mothers body and with nothing i will go back there the lord gave and the lord has taken away let the lords name be praised
 in all this job did no sin and did not say that gods acts were foolish
 my soul is tired of life i will let my sad thoughts go free in words my soul will make a bitter outcry
 i will say to god do not put me down as a sinner make clear to me what you have against me
 what profit is it to you to be cruel to give up the work of your hands looking kindly on the design of evil doers
 have you eyes of flesh or do you see as man sees
 are your days as the days of man or your years like his
 that you take note of my sin searching after my wrongdoing
 though you see that i am not an evil doer and there is no one who is able to take a man out of your hands
 your hands made me and i was formed by you but then changing your purpose you gave me up to destruction
 o keep in mind that you made me out of earth and will you send me back again to dust
 was i not drained out like milk becoming hard like cheese
 by you i was clothed with skin and flesh and joined together with bones and muscles
 you have been kind to me and your grace has been with me and your care has kept my spirit safe
 but you kept these things in the secret of your heart i am certain this was in your thoughts
 that if i did wrong you would take note of it and would not make me clear from sin
 that if i was an evil doer the curse would come on me and if i was upright my head would not be lifted up being full of shame and overcome with trouble
 and that if there was cause for pride you would go after me like a lion and again put out your wonders against me
 that you would send new witnesses against me increasing your wrath against me and letting loose new armies on me
 why then did you make me come out of my mothers body it would have been better for me to have taken my last breath and for no eye to have seen me
 and for me to have been as if i had not been to have been taken from my mothers body straight to my last resting place
 are not the days of my life small in number let your eyes be turned away from me so that i may have a little pleasure
 before i go to the place from which i will not come back to the land where all is dark and black
 a land of thick dark without order where the very light is dark
 then zophar the naamathite made answer and said
 are all these words to go unanswered and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk
 are your words of pride to make men keep quiet and are you to make sport with no one to put you to shame
 you may say my way is clean and i am free from sin in your eyes
 but if only god would take up the word opening his lips in argument with you
 and would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom and the wonders of his purpose 
 are you able to take gods measure to make discovery of the limits of the ruler of all
 they are higher than heaven what is there for you to do deeper than the underworld and outside your knowledge
 longer in measure than the earth and wider than the sea
 if he goes on his way shutting a man up and putting him to death who may make him go back from his purpose
 for in his eyes men are as nothing he sees evil and takes note of it
 and so a hollow minded man will get wisdom when a young ass of the field gets teaching
 but if you put your heart right stretching out your hands to him
 if you put far away the evil of your hands and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent
 then truly your face will be lifted up with no mark of sin and you will be fixed in your place without fear
 for your sorrow will go from your memory like waters flowing away
 and your life will be brighter than day though it is dark it will become like the morning
 and you will be safe because there is hope after looking round you will take your rest in quiet
 sleeping with no fear of danger and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes
 but the eyes of the evil doers will be wasting away their way of flight is gone and their only hope is the taking of their last breath
 and job made answer and said
 no doubt you have knowledge and wisdom will come to an end with you
 but i have a mind as well as you i am equal to you yes who has not knowledge of such things as these
 it seems that i am to be as one who is a cause of laughing to his neighbour one who makes his prayer to god and is answered  the upright man who has done no wrong is to be made sport of 
 in the thought of him who is in comfort there is no respect for one who is in trouble such is the fate of those whose feet are slipping
 there is wealth in the tents of those who make destruction and those by whom god is moved to wrath are safe even those whose god is their strength
 but put now a question to the beasts and get teaching from them or to the birds of the heaven and they will make it clear to you
 or to the things which go flat on the earth and they will give you wisdom and the fishes of the sea will give you news of it
 who does not see by all these that the hand of the lord has done this
 in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all flesh of man
 are not words tested by the ear even as food is tasted by the mouth
 old men have wisdom and a long life gives knowledge
 with him there is wisdom and strength power and knowledge are his
 truly there is no building up of what is pulled down by him when a man is shut up by him no one may let him loose
 truly he keeps back the waters and they are dry he sends them out and the earth is overturned
 with him are strength and wise designs he who is guided into error together with his guide are in his hands
 he takes away the wisdom of the wise guides and makes judges foolish
 he undoes the chains of kings and puts his band on them
 he makes priests prisoners overturning those in safe positions
 he makes the words of responsible persons without effect and takes away the good sense of the old
 he puts shame on chiefs and takes away the power of the strong
 uncovering deep things out of the dark and making the deep shade bright
 increasing nations and sending destruction on them making wide the lands of peoples and then giving them up
 he takes away the wisdom of the rulers of the earth and sends them wandering in a waste where there is no way
 they go feeling about in the dark without light wandering without help like those overcome with wine
 truly my eye has seen all this word of it has come to my ear and i have knowledge of it
 the same things are in my mind as in yours i am equal to you
 but i would have talk with the ruler of all and my desire is to have an argument with god
 but you put a false face on things all your attempts to put things right are of no value
 if only you would keep quiet it would be a sign of wisdom 
 give ear to the argument of my mouth and take note of the words of my lips
 will you say in gods name what is not right and put false words into his mouth
 will you have respect for gods person in this cause and put yourselves forward as his supporters
 will it be good for you to be searched out by him or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man
 he will certainly put you right if you have respect for persons in secret
 will not his glory put you in fear so that your hearts will be overcome before him
 your wise sayings are only dust and your strong places are only earth
 keep quiet and let me say what is in my mind whatever may come to me
 i will take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand
 truly he will put an end to me i have no hope but i will not give way in argument before him
 and that will be my salvation for an evil doer would not come before him
 give ear with care to my words and keep what i say in your minds
 see now i have put my cause in order and i am certain that i will be seen to be right
 is any one able to take up the argument against me if so i would keep quiet and give up my breath
 only two things do not do to me then i will come before your face
 take your hand far away from me and let me not be overcome by fear of you
 then at the sound of your voice i will give answer or let me put forward my cause for you to give me an answer
 what is the number of my evil doings and my sins give me knowledge of them
 why is your face veiled from me as if i was numbered among your haters
 will you be hard on a leaf in flight before the wind will you make a dry stem go more quickly on its way
 for you put bitter things on record against me and send punishment on me for the sins of my early years
 and you put chains on my feet watching all my ways and making a limit for my steps
 though a man comes to nothing like a bit of dead wood or like a robe which has become food for the worm
 as for man the son of woman his days are short and full of trouble
 he comes out like a flower and is cut down he goes in flight like a shade and is never seen again
 is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed with the purpose of judging him
 if only a clean thing might come out of an unclean  but it is not possible
 if his days are ordered and you have knowledge of the number of his months having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go
 let your eyes be turned away from him and take your hand from him so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day like a servant working for payment
 for there is hope of a tree if it is cut down it will come to life again and its branches will not come to an end
 though its root may be old in the earth and its cut off end may be dead in the dust
 still at the smell of water it will make buds and put out branches like a young plant
 but man comes to his death and is gone he gives up his spirit and where is he
 the waters go from a pool and a river becomes waste and dry
 so man goes down to his last resting place and comes not again till the heavens come to an end they will not be awake or come out of their sleep
 if only you would keep me safe in the underworld putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past giving me a fixed time when i might come to your memory again 
 if death takes a man will he come to life again all the days of my trouble i would be waiting till the time came for me to be free
 at the sound of your voice i would give an answer and you would have a desire for the work of your hands
 for now my steps are numbered by you and my sin is not overlooked
 my wrongdoing is corded up in a bag and my sin is shut up safe
 but truly a mountain falling comes to dust and a rock is moved from its place
 the stones are crushed small by the force of the waters the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing and so you put an end to the hope of man
 you overcome him for ever and he is gone his face is changed in death and you send him away
 his sons come to honour and he has no knowledge of it they are made low but he is not conscious of it
 only his flesh still has pain and his soul is sad
 and eliphaz the temanite made answer and said
 will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value or will he give birth to the east wind
 will he make arguments with words in which is no profit and with sayings which have no value
 truly you make the fear of god without effect so that the time of quiet worship before god is made less by your outcry
 for your mouth is guided by your sin and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself
 it is by your mouth even yours that you are judged to be in the wrong and not by me and your lips give witness against you
 were you the first man to come into the world or did you come into being before the hills
 were you present at the secret meeting of god and have you taken all wisdom for yourself
 what knowledge have you which we have not is there anything in your mind which is not in ours
 with us are men who are grey haired and full of years much older than your father
 are the comforts of god not enough for you and the gentle word which was said to you
 why is your heart uncontrolled and why are your eyes lifted up
 so that you are turning your spirit against god and letting such words go out of your mouth
 what is man that he may be clean and how may the son of woman be upright
 truly he puts no faith in his holy ones and the heavens are not clean in his eyes
 how much less one who is disgusting and unclean a man who takes in evil like water 
 take note and give ear to my words and i will say what i have seen
  the things which wise men have got from their fathers and have not kept secret from us
 for only to them was the land given and no strange people were among them 
 the evil man is in pain all his days and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small
 a sound of fear is in his ears in time of peace destruction will come on him
 he has no hope of coming safe out of the dark and his fate will be the sword
 he is wandering about in search of bread saying where is it and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him
 he is greatly in fear of the dark day trouble and pain overcome him
 because his hand is stretched out against god and his heart is lifted up against the ruler of all
 running against him like a man of war covered by his thick breastplate even like a king ready for the fight
 because his face is covered with fat and his body has become thick
 and he has made his resting place in the towns which have been pulled down in houses where no man had a right to be whose fate was to become masses of broken walls
 he does not get wealth for himself and is unable to keep what he has got the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth
 he does not come out of the dark his branches are burned by the flame and the wind takes away his bud
 let him not put his hope in what is false falling into error for he will get deceit as his reward
 his branch is cut off before its time and his leaf is no longer green
 he is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth or an olive tree dropping its flowers
 for the band of the evil doers gives no fruit and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire
 evil has made them with child and they give birth to trouble and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves
 and job made answer and said
 such things have frequently come to my ears you are comforters who only give trouble
 may words which are like the wind be stopped or what is troubling you to make answer to them
 it would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my souls place joining words together against you and shaking my head at you
 i might give you strength with my mouth and not keep back the comfort of my lips
 if i say what is in my mind my pain becomes no less and if i keep quiet how much of it goes from me
 but now he has overcome me with weariness and fear and i am in the grip of all my trouble
 it has come up as a witness against me and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face
 i am broken by his wrath and his hate has gone after me he has made his teeth sharp against me my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes
 their mouths are open wide against me the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face all of them come together in a mass against me
 god gives me over to the power of sinners sending me violently into the hands of evil doers
 i was in comfort but i have been broken up by his hands he has taken me by the neck shaking me to bits he has put me up as a mark for his arrows
 his bowmen come round about me their arrows go through my body without mercy my life is drained out on the earth
 i am broken with wound after wound he comes rushing on me like a man of war
 i have made haircloth the clothing of my skin and my horn is rolled in the dust
 my face is red with weeping and my eyes are becoming dark
 though my hands have done no violent acts and my prayer is clean
 o earth let not my blood be covered and let my cry have no resting place 
 even now my witness is in heaven and the supporter of my cause is on high
 my friends make sport of me to god my eyes are weeping
 so that he may give decision for a man in his cause with god and between a son of man and his neighbour
 for in a short time i will take the journey from which i will not come back
 my spirit is broken my days are ended the last resting place is ready for me
 truly those who make sport of me are round about me and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing
 be pleased now to be responsible for me to yourself for there is no other who will put his hand in mine
 you have kept their hearts from wisdom for this cause you will not give them honour
 as for him who is false to his friend for a reward light will be cut off from the eyes of his children
 he has made me a word of shame to the peoples i have become a mark for their sport
 my eyes have become dark because of my pain and all my body is wasted to a shade
 the upright are surprised at this and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil doers
 still the upright keeps on his way and he who has clean hands gets new strength
 but come back now all of you come and i will not see a wise man among you
 my days are past my purposes are broken off even the desires of my heart
 they are changing night into day they say the light is near the dark
 if i am waiting for the underworld as my house if i have made my bed in the dark
 if i say to the earth you are my father and to the worm my mother and my sister
 where then is my hope and who will see my desire
 will they go down with me into the underworld will we go down together into the dust
 then bildad the shuhite made answer and said
 how long will it be before you have done talking get wisdom and then we will say what is in our minds
 why do we seem as beasts in your eyes and as completely without knowledge
 but come back now come you who are wounding yourself in your passion will the earth be given up because of you or a rock be moved out of its place
 for the light of the sinner is put out and the flame of his fire is not shining
 the light is dark in his tent and the light shining over him is put out
 the steps of his strength become short and by his design destruction overtakes him
 his feet take him into the net and he goes walking into the cords
 his foot is taken in the net he comes into its grip
 the twisted cord is put secretly in the earth to take him and the cord is placed in his way
 he is overcome by fears on every side they go after him at every step
 his strength is made feeble for need of food and destruction is waiting for his falling footstep
 his skin is wasted by disease and his body is food for the worst of diseases
 he is pulled out of his tent where he was safe and he is taken away to the king of fears
 in his tent will be seen that which is not his burning stone is dropped on his house
 under the earth his roots are dry and over it his branch is cut off
 his memory is gone from the earth and in the open country there is no knowledge of his name
 he is sent away from the light into the dark he is forced out of the world
 he has no offspring or family among his people and in his living place there is no one of his name
 at his fate those of the west are shocked and those of the east are overcome with fear
 truly these are the houses of the sinner and this is the place of him who has no knowledge of god
 and job made answer and said
 how long will you make my life bitter crushing me with words
 ten times now you have made sport of me it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong
 and truly if i have been in error the effect of my error is only on myself
 if you make yourselves great against me using my punishment as an argument against me
 be certain that it is god who has done me wrong and has taken me in his net
 truly i make an outcry against the violent man but there is no answer i give a cry for help but no one takes up my cause
 my way is walled up by him so that i may not go by he has made my roads dark
 he has put off my glory from me and taken the crown from my head
 i am broken down by him on every side and i am gone my hope is uprooted like a tree
 his wrath is burning against me and i am to him as one of his haters
 his armies come on together they make their road high against me and put up their tents round mine
 he has taken my brothers far away from me they have seen my fate and have become strange to me
 my relations and my near friends have given me up and those living in my house have put me out of their minds
 i am strange to my women servants and seem to them as one from another country
 at my cry my servant gives me no answer and i have to make a prayer to him
 my breath is strange to my wife and i am disgusting to the offspring of my mothers body
 even young children have no respect for me when i get up their backs are turned on me
 all the men of my circle keep away from me and those dear to me are turned against me
 my bones are joined to my skin and i have got away with my flesh in my teeth
 have pity on me have pity on me o my friends  for the hand of god is on me
 why are you cruel to me like god for ever saying evil against me
 if only my words might be recorded  if they might be put in writing in a book 
 and with an iron pen and lead be cut into the rock for ever 
 but i am certain that he who will take up my cause is living and that in time to come he will take his place on the dust
 and  without my flesh i will see god
 whom i will see on my side and not as one strange to me my heart is broken with desire
 if you say how cruel we will be to him  because the root of sin is clearly in him
 be in fear of the sword for the sword is the punishment for such things so that you may be certain that there is a judge
 and there was a day when the sons of the gods came together before the lord and the satan came with them
 and the lord said to the satan where do you come from and the satan said in answer from wandering this way and that on the earth and walking about on it
 and the lord said to the satan have you taken note of my servant job for there is no one like him on the earth a man without sin and upright fearing god and keeping himself far from evil and he still keeps his righteousness though you have been moving me to send destruction on him without cause
 and the satan said in answer to the lord skin for skin all a man has he will give for his life
 but now if you only put your hand on his bone and his flesh he will certainly be cursing you to your face
 and the lord said to the satan see he is in your hands only do not take his life
 and the satan went out from before the lord and sent on job an evil disease covering his skin from his feet to the top of his head
 and he took a broken bit of a pot and seated in the dust was rubbing himself with the sharp edge of it
 and his wife said to him are you still keeping your righteousness say a curse against god and put an end to yourself
 and he said to her you are talking like one of the foolish women if we take the good god sends us are we not to take the evil when it comes in all this job kept his lips from sin
 and jobs three friends had word of all this evil which had come on him and they came every one from his place eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite so they came together to a meeting place in order that they might go and make clear to job their grief for him and give him comfort
 and lifting up their eyes when they were still far off it did not seem that the man they saw was job because of the change in him and they gave way to bitter weeping with signs of grief and put dust on their heads
 and they took their seats on the earth by his side for seven days and seven nights but no one said a word to him for they saw that his pain was very great
 then zophar the naamathite made answer and said
 for this cause my thoughts are troubling me and driving me on
 i have to give ear to arguments which put me to shame and your answers to me are wind without wisdom
 have you knowledge of this from early times when man was placed on the earth
 that the pride of the sinner is short and the joy of the evil doer but for a minute
 though he is lifted up to the heavens and his head goes up to the clouds
 like the waste from his body he comes to an end for ever those who have seen him say where is he
 he is gone like a dream and is not seen again he goes in flight like a vision of the night
 the eye which saw him sees him no longer and his place has no more knowledge of him
 his children are hoping that the poor will be kind to them and his hands give back his wealth
 his bones are full of young strength but it will go down with him into the dust
 though evil doing is sweet in his mouth and he keeps it secretly under his tongue
 though he takes care of it and does not let it go but keeps it still in his mouth
 his food becomes bitter in his stomach the poison of snakes is inside him
 he takes down wealth as food and sends it up again it is forced out of his stomach by god
 he takes the poison of snakes into his mouth the tongue of the snake is the cause of his death
 let him not see the rivers of oil the streams of honey and milk
 he is forced to give back the fruit of his work and may not take it for food he has no joy in the profit of his trading
 because he has been cruel to the poor turning away from them in their trouble because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up
 there is no peace for him in his wealth and no salvation for him in those things in which he took delight
 he had never enough for his desire for this cause his well being will quickly come to an end
 even when his wealth is great he is full of care for the hand of everyone who is in trouble is turned against him
 god gives him his desire and sends the heat of his wrath on him making it come down on him like rain
 he may go in flight from the iron spear but the arrow from the bow of brass will go through him
 he is pulling it out and it comes out of his back and its shining point comes out of his side he is overcome by fears
 all his wealth is stored up for the dark a fire not made by man sends destruction on him and on everything in his tent
 the heavens make clear his sin and the earth gives witness against him
 the produce of his house is taken away into another country like things given into the hands of others in the day of wrath
 this is the reward of the evil man and the heritage given to him by god
 then job made answer and said
 give attention with care to my words and let this be your comfort
 let me say what is in my mind and after that go on making sport of me
 as for me is my outcry against man is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled
 take note of me and be full of wonder put your hand on your mouth
 at the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear
 why is life given to the evil doers why do they become old and strong in power
 their children are ever with them and their offspring before their eyes
 their houses are free from fear and the rod of god does not come on them
 their ox is ready at all times to give seed their cow gives birth without dropping her young
 they send out their young ones like a flock and their children have pleasure in the dance
 they make songs to the instruments of music and are glad at the sound of the pipe
 their days come to an end without trouble and suddenly they go down to the underworld
 though they said to god go away from us for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways
 what is the ruler of all that we may give him worship and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him
 truly is not their well being in their power  the purpose of the evil doers is far from me 
 how frequently is the light of the evil doers put out or does trouble come on them how frequently does his wrath take them with cords
 how frequently are they as dry stems before the wind or as grass taken away by the storm wind
 you say god keeps punishment stored up for his children let him send it on the man himself so that he may have the punishment of it 
 let his eyes see his trouble and let him be full of the wrath of the ruler of all 
 for what interest has he in his house after him when the number of his months is ended
 is anyone able to give teaching to god for he is the judge of those who are on high
 one comes to his end in complete well being full of peace and quiet
 his buckets are full of milk and there is no loss of strength in his bones
 and another comes to his end with a bitter soul without ever tasting good
 together they go down to the dust and are covered by the worm
 see i am conscious of your thoughts and of your violent purposes against me
 for you say where is the house of the ruler and where is the tent of the evil doer
 have you not put the question to the travellers and do you not take note of their experience
 how the evil man goes free in the day of trouble and has salvation in the day of wrath
 who will make his way clear to his face and if he has done a thing who gives him punishment for it
 he is taken to his last resting place and keeps watch over it
 the earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him and all men come after him as there were unnumbered before him
 why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit
 then eliphaz the temanite made answer and said
 is it possible for a man to be of profit to god no for a mans wisdom is only of profit to himself
 is it of any interest to the ruler of all that you are upright or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin
 is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you
 is not your evil doing great and there is no end to your sins
 for you have taken your brothers goods when he was not in your debt and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it
 you do not give water to the tired traveller and from him who has no food you keep back bread
 for it was the man with power who had the land and the man with an honoured name who was living in it
 you have sent widows away without hearing their cause and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father
 for this cause nets are round your feet and you are overcome with sudden fear
 your light is made dark so that you are unable to see and you are covered by a mass of waters
 is not god as high as heaven and see the stars how high they are 
 and you say what knowledge has god is he able to give decisions through the deep dark
 thick clouds are covering him so that he is unable to see and he is walking on the arch of heaven
 will you keep the old way by which evil men went
 who were violently taken away before their time who were overcome by the rush of waters
 who said to god go away from us and what is the ruler of all able to do to us
 though he made their houses full of good things but the purpose of the evil doers is far from me 
 the upright saw it and were glad and those who had done no wrong made sport of them
 saying truly their substance is cut off and their wealth is food for the fire
 put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace so will you do well in your undertakings
 be pleased to take teaching from his mouth and let his words be stored up in your heart
 if you come back to the ruler of all making yourself low before him if you put evil far away from your tents
 and put your gold in the dust even your gold of ophir among the rocks of the valleys
 then the ruler of all will be your gold and his teaching will be your silver
 for then you will have delight in the ruler of all and your face will be lifted up to god
 you will make your prayer to him and be answered and you will give effect to your oaths
 your purposes will come about and light will be shining on your ways
 for god makes low those whose hearts are lifted up but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit
 he makes safe the man who is free from sin and if your hands are clean salvation will be yours
 and job made answer and said
 even today my outcry is bitter his hand is hard on my sorrow
 if only i had knowledge of where he might be seen so that i might come even to his seat 
 i would put my cause in order before him and my mouth would be full of arguments
 i would see what his answers would be and have knowledge of what he would say to me
 would he make use of his great power to overcome me no but he would give attention to me
 there an upright man might put his cause before him and i would be free for ever from my judge
 see i go forward but he is not there and back but i do not see him
 i am looking for him on the left hand but there is no sign of him and turning to the right i am not able to see him
 for he has knowledge of the way i take after i have been tested i will come out like gold
 my feet have gone in his steps i have kept in his way without turning to one side or to the other
 i have never gone against the orders of his lips the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart
 but his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it and he gives effect to the desire of his soul
 for what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end and his mind is full of such designs
 for this cause i am in fear before him my thoughts of him overcome me
 for god has made my heart feeble and my mind is troubled before the ruler of all
 for i am overcome by the dark and by the black night which is covering my face
 why are times not stored up by the ruler of all and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days
 the landmarks are changed by evil men they violently take away flocks together with their keepers
 they send away the ass of him who has no father they take the widows ox for debt
 the crushed are turned out of the way all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together
 like asses in the waste land they go out to their work looking for food with care from the waste land they get bread for their children
 they get mixed grain from the field and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth
 they take their rest at night without clothing and have no cover in the cold
 they are wet with the rain of the mountains and get into the cracks of the rock for cover
 the child without a father is forced from its mothers breast and they take the young children of the poor for debt
 others go about without clothing and though they have no food they get in the grain from the fields
 between the lines of olive trees they make oil though they have no drink they are crushing out the grapes
 from the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help but god does not take note of their prayer
 then there are those who are haters of the light who have no knowledge of its ways and do not go in them
 he who is purposing death gets up before day so that he may put to death the poor and those in need
 and the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening saying no eye will see me and he puts a cover on his face and in the night the thief goes about
 in the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses in the daytime they are shutting themselves up they have no knowledge of the light
 for the middle of the night is as morning to them they are not troubled by the fear of the dark
 they go quickly on the face of the waters their heritage is cursed in the earth the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vine garden
 snow waters become dry with the heat so do sinners go down into the underworld
 the public place of his town has no more knowledge of him and his name has gone from the memory of men he is rooted up like a dead tree
 he is not kind to the widow and he has no pity for her child
 but god by his power gives long life to the strong he gets up again though he has no hope of life
 he takes away his fear of danger and gives him support and his eyes are on his ways
 for a short time they are lifted up then they are gone they are made low they are pulled off like fruit and like the heads of grain they are cut off
 and if it is not so now who will make it clear that my words are false and that what i say is of no value
 then bildad the shuhite made answer and said
 rule and power are his he makes peace in his high places
 is it possible for his armies to be numbered and on whom is not his light shining
 how then is it possible for man to be upright before god or how may he be clean who is a son of woman
 see even the moon is not bright and the stars are not clean in his eyes
 how much less man who is an insect and the son of man who is a worm 
 then job made answer and said
 how have you given help to him who has no power  how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength 
 how have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom and fully made clear true knowledge 
 to whom have your words been said and whose spirit came out from you
 the shades in the underworld are shaking the waters and those living in them
 the underworld is uncovered before him and destruction has no veil
 by his hand the north is stretched out in space and the earth is hanging on nothing
 by him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds and the cloud does not give way under them
 by him the face of his high seat is veiled and his cloud stretched out over it
 by him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters to the limits of the light and the dark
 the pillars of heaven are shaking and are overcome by his sharp words
 by his power the sea was made quiet and by his wisdom rahab was wounded
 by his wind the heavens become bright by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through
 see these are only the outskirts of his ways and how small is that which comes to our ears about him  but the thunder of his acts of power is outside all knowledge
 and job again took up the word and said
 by the life of god who has taken away my right and of the ruler of all who has made my soul bitter
  for all my breath is still in me and the spirit of god is my life 
 truly there is no deceit in my lips and my tongue does not say what is false
 let it be far from me  i will certainly not say that you are right  i will come to death before i give up my righteousness
 i will keep it safe and will not let it go my heart has nothing to say against any part of my life
 let my hater be like the evil man and let him who comes against me be as the sinner
 for what is the hope of the sinner when he is cut off when god takes back his soul
 will his cry come to the ears of god when he is in trouble
 will he take delight in the ruler of all and make his prayer to god at all times
 i will give you teaching about the hand of god i will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the ruler of all
 truly you have all seen it yourselves why then have you become completely foolish
 this is the punishment of the evil doer from god and the heritage given to the cruel by the ruler of all
 if his children are increased it is for the sword and his offspring have not enough bread
 when those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease they are not put into the earth and their widows are not weeping for them
 though he may get silver together like dust and make ready great stores of clothing
 he may get them ready but the upright will put them on and he who is free from sin will take the silver for a heritage
 his house has no more strength than a spiders thread or a watchmans tent
 he goes to rest full of wealth but does so for the last time on opening his eyes he sees it there no longer
 fears overtake him like rushing waters in the night the storm wind takes him away
 the east wind takes him up and he is gone he is forced violently out of his place
 god sends his arrows against him without mercy he goes in flight before his hand
 men make signs of joy because of him driving him from his place with sounds of hissing
 truly there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is washed out
 iron is taken out of the earth and stone is changed into brass by the fire
 man puts an end to the dark searching out to the farthest limit the stones of the deep places of the dark
 he makes a deep mine far away from those living in the light of day when they go about on the earth they have no knowledge of those who are under them who are hanging far from men twisting from side to side on a cord
 as for the earth bread comes out of it but under its face it is turned up as if by fire
 its stones are the place of sapphires and it has dust of gold
 no bird has knowledge of it and the hawks eye has never seen it
 the great beasts have not gone over it and the cruel lion has not taken that way
 man puts out his hand on the hard rock overturning mountains by the roots
 he makes deep ways cut through the rock and his eye sees everything of value
 he keeps back the streams from flowing and makes the secret things come out into the light
 but where may wisdom be seen and where is the resting place of knowledge
 man has not seen the way to it and it is not in the land of the living
 the deep waters say it is not in me and the sea says it is not with me
 gold may not be given for it or a weight of silver in payment for it
 it may not be valued with the gold of ophir with the onyx of great price or the sapphire
 gold and glass are not equal to it in price and it may not be exchanged for jewels of the best gold
 there is no need to say anything about coral or crystal and the value of wisdom is greater than that of pearls
 the topaz of ethiopia is not equal to it and it may not be valued with the best gold
 from where then does wisdom come and where is the resting place of knowledge
 for it is kept secret from the eyes of all living unseen by the birds of the air
 destruction and death say we have only had word of it with our ears
 god has knowledge of the way to it and of its resting place
 for his eyes go to the ends of the earth and he sees everything under heaven
 when he made a weight for the wind measuring out the waters
 when he made a law for the rain and a way for the thunder flames
 then he saw it and put it on record he gave it its fixed form searching it out completely
 and he said to man truly the fear of the lord is wisdom and to keep from evil is the way to knowledge
 and job again took up the word and said
 if only i might again be as i was in the months which are past in the days when god was watching over me 
 when his light was shining over my head and when i went through the dark by his light
 as i was in my flowering years when my tent was covered by the hand of god
 while the ruler of all was still with me and my children were round me
 when my steps were washed with milk and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me
 when i went out of my door to go up to the town and took my seat in the public place
 the young men saw me and went away and the old men got up from their seats
 the rulers kept quiet and put their hands on their mouths
 the chiefs kept back their words and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths
 for when it came to their ears men said that i was truly happy and when their eyes saw they gave witness to me
 for i was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help to the child with no father and to him who had no supporter
 the blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me and i put a song of joy into the widows heart
 i put on righteousness as my clothing and was full of it right decisions were to me a robe and a head dress
 i was eyes to the blind and feet to him who had no power of walking
 i was a father to the poor searching out the cause of him who was strange to me
 by me the great teeth of the evil doer were broken and i made him give up what he had violently taken away
 then i said i will come to my end with my children round me my days will be as the sand in number
 my root will be open to the waters and the night mist will be on my branches
 my glory will be ever new and my bow will be readily bent in my hand
 men gave ear to me waiting and keeping quiet for my suggestions
 after i had said what was in my mind they were quiet and let my words go deep into their hearts
 they were waiting for me as for the rain opening their mouths wide as for the spring rains
 i was laughing at them when they had no hope and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear
 i took my place as a chief guiding them on their way and i was as a king among his army 
 then opening his mouth and cursing the day of his birth
 job made answer and said
 let destruction take the day of my birth and the night on which it was said a man child has come into the world
 that day  let it be dark let not god take note of it from on high and let not the light be shining on it
 let the dark and the black night take it for themselves let it be covered with a cloud let the dark shades of day send fear on it
 that night  let the thick dark take it let it not have joy among the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months
 as for that night let it have no fruit let no voice of joy be sounded in it
 let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day who are ready to make leviathan awake
 let its morning stars be dark let it be looking for light but may it not have any let it not see the eyes of the dawn
 because it did not keep the doors of my mothers body shut so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes
 why did death not take me when i came out of my mothers body why did i not when i came out give up my last breath
 why did the knees take me or why the breasts that they might give me milk
 for then i might have gone to my rest in quiet and in sleep have been in peace
 with kings and the wise ones of the earth who put up great houses for themselves
 or with rulers who had gold and whose houses were full of silver
 or as a child dead at birth i might never have come into existence like young children who have not seen the light
 there the passions of the evil are over and those whose strength has come to an end have rest
 there the prisoners are at peace together the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears
 the small and the great are there and the servant is free from his master
 why does he give light to him who is in trouble and life to the bitter in soul
 to those whose desire is for death but it comes not who are searching for it more than for secret wealth
 who are glad with great joy and full of delight when they come to their last resting place
 to a man whose way is veiled and who is shut in by god
 in place of my food i have grief and cries of sorrow come from me like water
 for i have a fear and it comes on me and my heart is greatly troubled
 i have no peace no quiet and no rest nothing but pain comes on me
 but now those who are younger than i make sport of me those whose fathers i would not have put with the dogs of my flocks
 of what use is the strength of their hands to me all force is gone from them
 they are wasted for need of food biting the dry earth their only hope of life is in the waste land
 they are pulling off the salt leaves from the brushwood and making a meal of roots
 they are sent out from among their townsmen men are crying after them as thieves
 they have to get a resting place in the hollows of the valleys in holes of the earth and rocks
 they make noises like asses among the brushwood they get together under the thorns
 they are sons of shame and of men without a name who have been forced out of the land
 and now i have become their song and i am a word of shame to them
 i am disgusting to them they keep away from me and put marks of shame on me
 for he has made loose the cord of my bow and put me to shame he has sent down my flag to the earth before me
 the lines of his men of war put themselves in order and make high their ways of destruction against me
 they have made waste my roads with a view to my destruction his bowmen come round about me
 as through a wide broken place in the wall they come on i am overturned by the shock of their attack
 fears have come on me my hope is gone like the wind and my well being like a cloud
 but now my soul is turned to water in me days of trouble overtake me
 the flesh is gone from my bones and they give me no rest there is no end to my pains
 with great force he takes a grip of my clothing pulling me by the neck of my coat
 truly god has made me low even to the earth and i have become like dust
 you give no answer to my cry and take no note of my prayer
 you have become cruel to me the strength of your hand is hard on me
 lifting me up you make me go on the wings of the wind i am broken up by the storm
 for i am certain that you will send me back to death and to the meeting place ordered for all living
 has not my hand been stretched out in help to the poor have i not been a saviour to him in his trouble
 have i not been weeping for the crushed and was not my soul sad for him who was in need
 for i was looking for good and evil came i was waiting for light and it became dark
 my feelings are strongly moved and give me no rest days of trouble have overtaken me
 i go about in dark clothing uncomforted i get up in the public place crying out for help
 i have become a brother to the jackals and go about in the company of ostriches
 my skin is black and dropping off me and my bones are burning with the heat of my disease
 and my music has been turned to sorrow and the sound of my pipe into the noise of weeping
 i made an agreement with my eyes how then might my eyes be looking on a virgin
 for what is gods reward from on high or the heritage given by the ruler of all from heaven
 is it not trouble for the sinner and destruction for the evil doers
 does he not see my ways and are not my steps all numbered
 if i have gone in false ways or my foot has been quick in working deceit
  let me be measured in upright scales and let god see my righteousness 
 if my steps have been turned out of the way or if my heart went after my eyes or if the property of another is in my hands
 let me put seed in the earth for another to have the fruit of it and let my produce be uprooted
 if my heart went after another mans wife or if i was waiting secretly at my neighbours door
 then let my wife give pleasure to another man and let others make use of her body
 for that would be a crime it would be an act for which punishment would be measured out by the judges
 it would be a fire burning even to destruction and taking away all my produce
 if i did wrong in the cause of my man servant or my woman servant when they went to law with me
 what then will i do when god comes as my judge and what answer may i give to his questions
 did not god make him as well as me did he not give us life in our mothers bodies
 if i kept back the desire of the poor if the widows eye was looking for help to no purpose
 if i kept my food for myself and did not give some of it to the child with no father
  for i was cared for by god as by a father from my earliest days he was my guide from the body of my mother 
 if i saw one near to death for need of clothing and that the poor had nothing covering him
 if his back did not give me a blessing and the wool of my sheep did not make him warm
 if my hand had been lifted up against him who had done no wrong when i saw that i was supported by the judges
 may my arm be pulled from my body and be broken from its base
 for the fear of god kept me back and because of his power i might not do such things
 if i made gold my hope or if i ever said to the best gold i have put my faith in you
 if i was glad because my wealth was great and because my hand had got together a great store
 if when i saw the sun shining and the moon moving on its bright way
 a secret feeling of worship came into my heart and my hand gave kisses from my mouth
 that would have been another sin to be rewarded with punishment by the judges for i would have been false to god on high
 if i was glad at the trouble of my hater and gave cries of joy when evil overtook him
  for i did not let my mouth give way to sin in putting a curse on his life 
 if the men of my tent did not say who has not had full measure of his meat
 the traveller did not take his nights rest in the street and my doors were open to anyone on a journey
 if i kept my evil doings covered and my sin in the secret of my breast
 for fear of the great body of people or for fear that families might make sport of me so that i kept quiet and did not go out of my door
 if only god would give ear to me and the ruler of all would give me an answer  or if what he has against me had been put in writing 
 truly i would take up the book in my hands it would be to me as a crown
 i would make clear the number of my steps i would put it before him like a prince  the words of job are ended
 if my land has made an outcry against me or the ploughed earth has been in sorrow
 if i have taken its produce without payment causing the death of its owners
 then in place of grain let thorns come up and in place of barley evil smelling plants
 so these three men gave no more answers to job because he seemed to himself to be right
 and elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the family of ram was angry burning with wrath against job because he seemed to himself more right than god
 and he was angry with his three friends because they had been unable to give him an answer and had not made jobs sin clear
 now elihu had kept quiet while job was talking because they were older than he
 and when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men he was very angry
 and elihu the son of barachel the buzite made answer and said i am young and you are very old so i was in fear and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you
 i said to myself it is right for the old to say what is in their minds and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom
 but truly it is the spirit in man even the breath of the ruler of all which gives them knowledge
 it is not the old who are wise and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right
 so i say give ear to me and i will put forward my knowledge
 i was waiting for your words i was giving ear to your wise sayings while you were searching out what to say
 i was taking note and truly not one of you was able to make clear jobs error or to give an answer to his words
 take care that you do not say wisdom is here god may overcome him but not man
 i will not put forward words like these or make use of your sayings in answer to him
 fear has overcome them they have no more answers to give they have come to an end of words
 and am i to go on waiting while they have nothing to say while they keep quiet and give no more answers
 i will give my answer i will put forward my knowledge
 for i am full of words i am unable to keep in my breath any longer
 my stomach is like wine which is unable to get out like skins full of new wine it is almost burst
 let me say what is in my mind so that i may get comfort let me give answer with open mouth
 let me not give respect to any man or give names of honour to any living
 for i am not able to give names of honour to any man and if i did my maker would quickly take me away
 and now o job give ear to my words and take note of all i say
 see now my mouth is open my tongue gives out words
 my heart is overflowing with knowledge my lips say what is true
 the spirit of god has made me and the breath of the ruler of all gives me life
 if you are able give me an answer put your cause in order and come forward
 see i am the same as you are in the eyes of god i was cut off from the same bit of wet earth
 fear of me will not overcome you and my hand will not be hard on you
 but you said in my hearing and your voice came to my ears
 i am clean without sin i am washed and there is no evil in me
 see he is looking for something against me in his eyes i am as one of his haters
 he puts chains on my feet he is watching all my ways
 truly in saying this you are wrong for god is greater than man
 why do you put forward your cause against him saying he gives no answer to any of my words
 for god gives his word in one way even in two and man is not conscious of it
 in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep comes on men while they take their rest on their beds
 then he makes his secrets clear to men so that they are full of fear at what they see
 in order that man may be turned from his evil works and that pride may be taken away from him
 to keep back his soul from the underworld and his life from destruction
 pain is sent on him as a punishment while he is on his bed there is no end to the trouble in his bones
 he has no desire for food and his soul is turned away from delicate meat
 his flesh is so wasted away that it may not be seen and his bones 
 and his soul comes near to the underworld and his life to the angels of death
 if now there may be an angel sent to him one of the thousands which there are to be between him and god and to make clear to man what is right for him
 and if he has mercy on him and says let him not go down to the underworld i have given the price for his life
 then his flesh becomes young again and he comes back to the days of his early strength
 he makes his prayer to god and he has mercy on him he sees gods face with cries of joy he gives news of his righteousness to men
 he makes a song saying i did wrong turning from the straight way but he did not give me the reward of my sin
 he kept my soul from the underworld and my life sees the light in full measure
 truly god does all these things to man twice and three times
 keeping back his soul from the underworld so that he may see the light of life
 take note o job give ear to me keep quiet while i say what is in my mind
 if you have anything to say give me an answer for it is my desire that you may be judged free from sin
 if not give attention to me and keep quiet and i will give you wisdom
 and elihu made answer and said
 give ear you wise to my words and you who have knowledge give attention to me
 for words are tested by the ear as food is tasted by the mouth
 let us make the decision for ourselves as to what is right let us have the knowledge among ourselves of what is good
 for job has said i am upright and it is god who has taken away my right
 though i am right still i am in pain my wound may not be made well though i have done no wrong
 what man is like job a man who freely makes sport of god
 and goes in the company of evil doers walking in the way of sinners
 for he has said it is no profit to a man to take delight in god
 now then you wise take note you men of knowledge give ear to me let it be far from god to do evil and from the ruler of all to do wrong
 for he gives to every man the reward of his work and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways
 truly god does not do evil and the ruler of all is not a false judge
 who put the earth into his care or made him responsible for the world
 if he made his spirit come back to him taking his breath into himself again
 all flesh would come to an end together and man would go back to the dust
 if you are wise take note of this give ear to the voice of my words
 how may a hater of right be a ruler and will you say that the upright ruler of all is evil
 he who says to a king you are an evil doer and to rulers you are sinners
 who has no respect for rulers and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor for they are all the work of his hands
 suddenly they come to an end even in the middle of the night the blow comes on the men of wealth and they are gone and the strong are taken away without the hand of man
 for his eyes are on the ways of a man and he sees all his steps
 there is no dark place and no thick cloud in which the workers of evil may take cover
 for he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged
 he sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause and puts others in their place
 for he has knowledge of their works overturning them in the night so that they are crushed
 the evil doers are broken by his wrath he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers
 because they did not go after him and took no note of his ways
 so that the cry of the poor might come up to him and the prayer of those in need come to his ears
 
 
 
 
 
 men of knowledge and all wise men hearing me will say
 jobs words do not come from knowledge they are not the fruit of wisdom
 may job be tested to the end because his answers have been like those of evil men
 for in addition to his sin he is uncontrolled in heart before our eyes he makes sport of god increasing his words against him
 and elihu made answer and said
 does it seem to you to be right and righteousness before god to say
 what profit is it to me and how am i better off than if i had done wrong
 i will make answer to you and to your friends
 let your eyes be turned to the heavens and lifted up to see the skies they are higher than you
 if you have done wrong is he any the worse for it and if your sins are great in number what is it to him
 if you are upright what do you give to him or what does he take from your hand
 your evil doing may have an effect on a man like yourself or your righteousness on a son of man
 because the hand of the cruel is hard on them men are making sounds of grief they are crying out for help because of the arm of the strong
 but no one has said where is god my maker who gives songs in the night
 who gives us more knowledge than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heaven
 there they are crying out because of the pride of the evil doers but he gives them no answer
 but god will not give ear to what is false or the ruler of all take note of it
 how much less when you say that you do not see him that the cause is before him and you are waiting for him
 and now  
 and jobs mouth is open wide to give out what is of no profit increasing words without knowledge
 and elihu went on to say
 give me a little more time and i will make it clear to you for i have still something to say for god
 i will get my knowledge from far and i will give righteousness to my maker
 for truly my words are not false one who has all knowledge is talking with you
 truly god gives up the hard hearted and will not give life to the sinner
 his eyes are ever on the upright and he gives to the crushed their right
 lifting them up to the seat of kings and making them safe for ever
 and if they have been prisoned in chains and taken in cords of trouble
 then he makes clear to them what they have done even their evil works in which they have taken pride
 their ear is open to his teaching and he gives them orders so that their hearts may be turned from evil
 if they give ear to his voice and do his word then he gives them long life and years full of pleasure
 but if not they come to their end and give up their breath without knowledge
 those who have no fear of god keep wrath stored up in their hearts they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners
 they come to their end while they are still young their life is short like that of those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of their gods
 he makes the wrong done to the poor the way of their salvation opening their ears by their trouble
 
 
 
 
 
 take care not to be turned to sin for you have taken evil for your part in place of sorrow
 truly god is lifted up in strength who is a ruler like him
 who ever gave orders to him or said to him you have done wrong
 see that you give praise to his work about which men make songs
 all people are looking on it man sees it from far
 truly god is great greater than all our knowledge the number of his years may not be searched out
 for he takes up the drops from the sea he sends them through his mist as rain
 flowing down from the sky and dropping on the peoples
 and who has knowledge of how the clouds are stretched out or of the thunders of his tent
 see he is stretching out his mist covering the tops of the mountains with it
 for by these he gives food to the peoples and bread in full measure
 he takes the light in his hands sending it against the mark
 the thunder makes clear his passion and the storm gives news of his wrath
 at this my heart is shaking it is moved out of its place
 give ear to the rolling noise of his voice to the hollow sound which goes out of his mouth
 he sends it out through all the heaven and his thunder flame to the ends of the earth
 after it a voice is sounding thundering out the word of his power he does not keep back his thunder flames from his mouth his voice is sounding
 he does wonders more than may be searched out great things of which we have no knowledge
 for he says to the snow make the earth wet and to the rain storm come down
 he puts an end to the work of every man so that all may see his work
 then the beasts go into their holes and take their rest
 out of its place comes the storm wind and the cold out of its store houses
 by the breath of god ice is made and the wide waters are shut in
 the thick cloud is weighted with thunder flame and the cloud sends out its light
 and it goes this way and that round about turning itself by his guiding to do whatever he gives orders to be done on the face of his world of men
 for a rod or for a curse or for mercy causing it to come on the mark
 give ear to this o job and keep quiet in your place and take note of the wonders worked by god
 have you knowledge of gods ordering of his works how he makes the light of his cloud to be seen
 have you knowledge of the balancings of the clouds the wonders of him who has all wisdom
 you whose clothing is warm when the earth is quiet because of the south wind
 will you with him make the skies smooth and strong as a polished looking glass
 make clear to me what we are to say to him we are unable to put our cause before him because of the dark
 how may he have knowledge of my desire for talk with him or did any man ever say may destruction come on me
 and now the light is not seen for it is dark because of the clouds but a wind comes clearing them away
 a bright light comes out of the north gods glory is greatly to be feared
 there is no searching out of the ruler of all his strength and his judging are great he is full of righteousness doing no wrong
 for this cause men go in fear of him he has no respect for any who are wise in heart
 and the lord made answer to job out of the storm wind and said
 who is this who makes the purpose of god dark by words without knowledge
 get your strength together like a man of war i will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
 where were you when i put the earth on its base say if you have knowledge
 by whom were its measures fixed say if you have wisdom or by whom was the line stretched out over it
 on what were its pillars based or who put down its angle stone
 when the morning stars made songs together and all the sons of the gods gave cries of joy
 or where were you when the sea came to birth pushing out from its secret place
 when i made the cloud its robe and put thick clouds as bands round it
 ordering a fixed limit for it with locks and doors
 and said so far you may come and no farther and here the pride of your waves will be stopped
 have you from your earliest days given orders to the morning or made the dawn conscious of its place
 so that it might take a grip of the skirts of the earth shaking all the evil doers out of it
 it is changed like wet earth under a stamp and is coloured like a robe
 and from the evil doers their light is kept back and the arm of pride is broken
 have you come into the springs of the sea walking in the secret places of the deep
 have the doors of death been open to you or have the door keepers of the dark ever seen you
 have you taken note of the wide limits of the earth say if you have knowledge of it all
 which is the way to the resting place of the light and where is the store house of the dark
 so that you might take it to its limit guiding it to its house
 no doubt you have knowledge of it for then you had come to birth and the number of your days is great
 have you come into the secret place of snow or have you seen the store houses of the ice drops
 which i have kept for the time of trouble for the day of war and fighting
 which is the way to the place where the wind is measured out and the east wind sent out over the earth
 by whom has the way been cut for the flowing of the rain and the flaming of the thunder
 causing rain to come on a land where no man is living on the waste land which has no people
 to give water to the land where there is waste and destruction and to make the dry land green with young grass
 has the rain a father or who gave birth to the drops of night mist
 out of whose body came the ice and who gave birth to the cold mist of heaven
 the waters are joined together hard as a stone and the face of the deep is covered
 are the bands of the pleiades fixed by you or are the cords of orion made loose
 do you make mazzaroth come out in its right time or are the bear and its children guided by you
 have you knowledge of the laws of the heavens did you give them rule over the earth
 is your voice sent up to the cloud so that you may be covered by the weight of waters
 do you send out the thunder flames so that they may go and say to you here we are
 who has put wisdom in the high clouds or given knowledge to the lights of the north
 by whose wisdom are the clouds numbered or the water skins of the heavens turned to the earth
 when the earth becomes hard as metal and is joined together in masses
 do you go after food for the she lion or get meat so that the young lions may have enough
 when they are stretched out in their holes and are waiting in the brushwood
 who gives in the evening the meat he is searching for when his young ones are crying to god when the young lions with loud noise go wandering after their food
 have you knowledge of the rock goats or do you see the roes giving birth to their young
 is the number of their months fixed by you or is the time when they give birth ordered by you
 they are bent down they give birth to their young they let loose the fruit of their body
 their young ones are strong living in the open country they go out and do not come back again
 who has let the ass of the fields go free or made loose the bands of the loud voiced beast
 to whom i have given the waste land for a heritage and the salt land as a living place
 he makes sport of the noise of the town the voice of the driver does not come to his ears
 he goes looking for his grass lands in the mountains searching out every green thing
 will the ox of the mountains be your servant or is his nights resting place by your food store
 will he be pulling your plough with cords turning up the valleys after you
 will you put your faith in him because his strength is great will you give the fruit of your work into his care
 will you be looking for him to come back and get in your seed to the crushing floor
 is the wing of the ostrich feeble or is it because she has no feathers
 that she puts her eggs on the earth warming them in the dust
 without a thought that they may be crushed by the foot and broken by the beasts of the field
 she is cruel to her young ones as if they were not hers her work is to no purpose she has no fear
 for god has taken wisdom from her mind and given her no measure of knowledge
 when she is shaking her wings on high she makes sport of the horse and of him who is seated on him
 do you give strength to the horse is it by your hand that his neck is clothed with power
 is it through you that he is shaking like a locust in the pride of his loud sounding breath
 he is stamping with joy in the valley he makes sport of fear
 in his strength he goes out against the arms of war turning not away from the sword
 the bow is sounding against him he sees the shining point of spear and arrow
 shaking with passion he is biting the earth he is not able to keep quiet at the sound of the horn
 when it comes to his ears he says aha  he is smelling the fight from far off and hearing the thunder of the captains and the war cries
 is it through your knowledge that the hawk takes his flight stretching out his wings to the south
 or is it by your orders that the eagle goes up and makes his resting place on high
 on the rock is his house and on the mountain top his strong place
 from there he is watching for food his eye sees it far off
 his young have blood for their drink and where the dead bodies are there is he to be seen
 and eliphaz the temanite made answer and said
 if one says a word will it be a weariness to you but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind
 truly you have been a helper to others and you have made feeble hands strong
 he who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words and you have given strength to bent knees
 but now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you you are touched by it and your mind is troubled
 is not your fear of god your support and your upright way of life your hope
 have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man or when were the god fearing ever cut off
 what i have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed and evil planted get the same for themselves
 by the breath of god destruction takes them and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off
 though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice may be loud the teeth of the young lions are broken
 the old lion comes to his end for need of food and the young of the she lion go wandering in all directions
 a word was given to me secretly and the low sound of it came to my ears
 in troubled thoughts from visions of the night when deep sleep comes on men
 fear came on me and shaking and my bones were full of trouble
 and a breath was moving over my face the hair of my flesh became stiff
 something was present before me but i was not able to see it clearly there was a form before my eyes a quiet voice came to my ears saying
 may a man be upright before god or a man be clean before his maker
 truly he puts no faith in his servants and he sees error in his angels
 how much more those living in houses of earth whose bases are in the dust  they are crushed more quickly than an insect
 between morning and evening they are completely broken they come to an end for ever and no one takes note
 if their tent cord is pulled up do they not come to an end and without wisdom
 
 will he who is protesting give teaching to the ruler of all let him who has arguments to put forward against god give an answer
 and job said in answer to the lord
 truly i am of no value what answer may i give to you i will put my hand on my mouth
 i have said once and even twice what was in my mind but i will not do so again
 then the lord made answer to job out of the storm wind and said
 get your strength together like a man of war i will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
 will you even make my right of no value will you say that i am wrong in order to make clear that you are right
 have you an arm like god have you a voice of thunder like his
 put on the ornaments of your pride be clothed with glory and power
 let your wrath be overflowing let your eyes see all the sons of pride and make them low
 send destruction on all who are lifted up pulling down the sinners from their places
 let them be covered together in the dust let their faces be dark in the secret place of the underworld
 then i will give praise to you saying that your right hand is able to give you salvation
 see now the great beast whom i made even as i made you he takes grass for food like the ox
 his strength is in his body and his force in the muscles of his stomach
 his tail is curving like a cedar the muscles of his legs are joined together
 his bones are pipes of brass his legs are like rods of iron
 he is the chief of the ways of god made by him for his pleasure
 he takes the produce of the mountains where all the beasts of the field are at play
 he takes his rest under the trees of the river and in the pool under the shade of the water plants
 he is covered by the branches of the trees the grasses of the stream are round him
 truly if the river is overflowing it gives him no cause for fear he has no sense of danger even if jordan is rushing against his mouth
 will anyone take him when he is on the watch or put metal teeth through his nose
 is it possible for leviathan to be pulled out with a fish hook or for a hook to be put through the bone of his mouth
 will you put a cord into his nose or take him away with a cord round his tongue
 will he make prayers to you or say soft words to you
 will he make an agreement with you so that you may take him as a servant for ever
 will you make sport with him as with a bird or put him in chains for your young women
 will the fishermen make profit out of him will they have him cut up for the traders
 will you put sharp pointed irons into his skin or fish spears into his head
 only put your hand on him and see what a fight you will have you will not do it again 
 truly the hope of his attacker is false he is overcome even on seeing him 
 he is so cruel that no one is ready to go against him who then is able to keep his place before me
 who ever went against me and got the better of me there is no one under heaven 
 i will not keep quiet about the parts of his body or about his power and the strength of his frame
 who has ever taken off his outer skin who may come inside his inner coat of iron
 who has made open the doors of his face fear is round about his teeth
 his back is made of lines of plates joined tight together one against the other like a stamp
 one is so near to the other that no air may come between them
 they take a grip of one another they are joined together so that they may not be parted
 his sneezings give out flames and his eyes are like the eyes of the dawn
 out of his mouth go burning lights and flames of fire are jumping up
 smoke comes out of his nose like a pot boiling on the fire
 his breath puts fire to coals and a flame goes out of his mouth
 strength is in his neck and fear goes dancing before him
 the plates of his flesh are joined together fixed and not to be moved
 his heart is as strong as a stone hard as the lower crushing stone
 when he gets ready for the fight the strong are overcome with fear
 the sword may come near him but is not able to go through him the spear or the arrow or the sharp pointed iron
 iron is to him as dry grass and brass as soft wood
 the arrow is not able to put him to flight stones are no more to him than dry stems
 a thick stick is no better than a leaf of grass and he makes sport of the onrush of the spear
 under him are sharp edges of broken pots as if he was pulling a grain crushing instrument over the wet earth
 the deep is boiling like a pot of spices and the sea like a perfume vessel
 after him his way is shining so that the deep seems white
 on earth there is not another like him who is made without fear
 everything which is high goes in fear of him he is king over all the sons of pride
 and job said in answer to the lord
 i see that you are able to do every thing and to give effect to all your designs
 who is this who makes dark the purpose of god by words without knowledge for i have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out
 give ear to me and i will say what is in my mind i will put questions to you and you will give me the answers
 word of you had come to my ears but now my eye has seen you
 for this cause i give witness that what i said is false and in sorrow i take my seat in the dust
 and it came about after he had said these words to job that the lord said to eliphaz the temanite i am very angry with you and your two friends because you have not said what is right about me as my servant job has
 and now take seven oxen and seven sheep and go to my servant job and give a burned offering for yourselves and my servant job will make prayer for you that i may not send punishment on you because you have not said what is right about me as my servant job has
 and eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did as the lord had said and the lord gave ear to job
 and the lord made up to job for all his losses after he had made prayer for his friends and all job had before was increased by the lord twice as much
 and all his brothers and sisters and his friends of earlier days came and took food with him in his house and made clear their grief for him and gave him comfort for all the evil which the lord had sent on him and they all gave him a bit of money and a gold ring
 and the lords blessing was greater on the end of jobs life than on its start and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats and six thousand camels and two thousand oxen and a thousand she asses
 and he had seven sons and three daughters
 and he gave the first the name of jemimah the second keziah and the third keren happuch
 and there were no women so beautiful as the daughters of job in all the earth and their father gave them a heritage among their brothers
 and after this job had a hundred and forty years of life and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generations
 and job came to his end old and full of days
 give now a cry for help is there anyone who will give you an answer and to which of the holy ones will you make your prayer
 for wrath is the cause of death to the foolish and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion
 i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly the curse came on his house
 now his children have no safe place and they are crushed before the judges for no one takes up their cause
 their produce is taken by him who has no food and their grain goes to the poor and he who is in need of water gets it from their spring
 for evil does not come out of the dust or trouble out of the earth
 but trouble is mans fate from birth as the flames go up from the fire
 but as for me i would make my prayer to god and i would put my cause before him
 who does great things outside our knowledge wonders without number
 who gives rain on the earth and sends water on the fields
 lifting up those who are low and putting the sad in a safe place
 who makes the designs of the wise go wrong so that they are unable to give effect to their purposes
 he takes the wise in their secret designs and the purposes of the twisted are cut off suddenly
 in the daytime it becomes dark for them and in the sunlight they go feeling about as if it was night
 but he keeps safe from their sword those who have no father and the poor from the power of the strong
 so the poor man has hope and the mouth of the evil doer is stopped
 truly that man is happy who has training from the hand of god so do not let your heart be shut to the teaching of the ruler of all
 for after his punishment he gives comfort and after wounding his hands make you well
 he will keep you safe from six troubles and in seven no evil will come near you
 when there is need of food he will keep you from death and in war from the power of the sword
 he will keep you safe from the evil tongue and you will have no fear of wasting when it comes
 you will make sport of destruction and need and will have no fear of the beasts of the earth
 for you will be in agreement with the stones of the earth and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you
 and you will be certain that your tent is at peace and after looking over your property you will see that nothing is gone
 you will be certain that your seed will be great and your offspring like the plants of the earth
 you will come to your last resting place in full strength as the grain is taken up to the crushing floor in its time
 see we have made search with care and it is so it has come to our ears see that you take note of it for yourself
 and job made answer and said
 if only my passion might be measured and put into the scales against my trouble 
 for then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas because of this my words have been uncontrolled
 for the arrows of the ruler of all are present with me and their poison goes deep into my spirit his army of fears is put in order against me
 does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass or does the ox make sounds over his food
 will a man take food which has no taste without salt or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain
 my soul has no desire for such things they are as disease in my food
 if only i might have an answer to my prayer and god would give me my desire 
 if only he would be pleased to put an end to me and would let loose his hand so that i might be cut off 
 so i would still have comfort and i would have joy in the pains of death for i have not been false to the words of the holy one
 have i strength to go on waiting or have i any end to be looking forward to
 is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh brass
 i have no help in myself and wisdom is completely gone from me
 he whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the ruler of all
 my friends have been false like a stream like streams in the valleys which come to an end
 which are dark because of the ice and the snow falling into them
 under the burning sun they are cut off and come to nothing because of the heat
 the camel trains go out of their way they go up into the waste and come to destruction
 the camel trains of tema were searching with care the bands of sheba were waiting for them
 they were put to shame because of their hope they came and their hope was gone
 so have you now become to me you see my sad condition and are in fear
 did i say give me something or make a payment for me out of your wealth
 or get me out of the power of my hater or give money so that i may be free from the power of the cruel ones
 give me teaching and i will be quiet and make me see my error
 how pleasing are upright words  but what force is there in your arguments
 my words may seem wrong to you but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind
 truly you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors and would make a profit out of your friend
 now then let your eyes be turned to me for truly i will not say what is false to your face
 let your minds be changed and do not have an evil opinion of me yes be changed for my righteousness is still in me
 is there evil in my tongue is not the cause of my trouble clear to me
 has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment
 as a servant desiring the shades of evening and a workman looking for his payment
 so i have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose and nights of weariness are given to me
 when i go to my bed i say when will it be time to get up but the night is long and i am turning from side to side till morning light
 my flesh is covered with worms and dust my skin gets hard and then is cracked again
 my days go quicker than the cloth workers thread and come to an end without hope
 o keep in mind that my life is wind my eye will never again see good
 the eye of him who sees me will see me no longer your eyes will be looking for me but i will be gone
 a cloud comes to an end and is gone so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again
 he will not come back to his house and his place will have no more knowledge of him
 so i will not keep my mouth shut i will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit my soul will make a bitter outcry
 am i a sea or a sea beast that you put a watch over me
 when i say in my bed i will have comfort there i will get rest from my disease
 then you send dreams to me and visions of fear
 so that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains
 i have no desire for life i would not be living for ever  keep away from me for my days are as a breath
 what is man that you have made him great and that your attention is fixed on him
 and that your hand is on him every morning and that you are testing him every minute
 how long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me so that i may have a minutes breathing space
 if i have done wrong what have i done to you o keeper of men why have you made me a mark for your blows so that i am a weariness to myself
 and why do you not take away my sin and let my wrongdoing be ended for now i go down to the dust and you will be searching for me with care but i will be gone
 then bildad the shuhite made answer and said
 how long will you say these things and how long will the words of your mouth be like a strong wind
 does god give wrong decisions or is the ruler of all not upright in his judging
 if your children have done evil against him then their punishment is from his hand
 if you will make search for god with care and put your request before the ruler of all
 if you are clean and upright then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again
 and though your start was small your end will be very great
 put the question now to the past generations and give attention to what has been searched out by their fathers
  for we are but of yesterday and have no knowledge because our days on earth are gone like a shade 
 will they not give you teaching and say words of wisdom to you
 will the river plant come up in its pride without wet earth will the grass get tall without water
 when it is still green without being cut down it becomes dry and dead before any other plant
 so is the end of all who do not keep god in mind and the hope of the evil doer comes to nothing
 whose support is cut off and whose hope is no stronger than a spiders thread
 he is looking to his family for support but it is not there he puts his hope in it but it comes to nothing
 he is full of strength before the sun and his branches go out over his garden
 his roots are twisted round the stones forcing their way in between them
 if he is taken away from his place then it will say i have not seen you
 such is the joy of his way and out of the dust another comes up to take his place
 truly god will not give up him who is without sin and will not take evil doers by the hand
 the time will come when your mouth will be full of laughing and cries of joy will come from your lips
 your haters will be clothed with shame and the tent of the sinner will not be seen again
 and job made answer and said
 truly i see that it is so and how is it possible for a man to get his right before god
 if a man was desiring to go to law with him he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions
 he is wise in heart and great in strength who ever made his face hard against him and any good came of it
 it is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge overturning them in his wrath
 who is moving the earth out of its place so that its pillars are shaking
 who gives orders to the sun and it does not give its light and who keeps the stars from shining
 by whose hand the heavens were stretched out and who is walking on the waves of the sea
 who made the bear and orion and the pleiades and the store houses of the south
 who does great things not to be searched out yes wonders without number
 see he goes past me and i see him not he goes on before but i have no knowledge of him
 if he puts out his hand to take by whom may it be turned back who may say to him what are you doing
 gods wrath may not be turned back the helpers of rahab were bent down under him
 how much less may i give an answer to him using the right words in argument with him
 even if my cause was good i would not be able to give an answer i would make request for grace from him who was against me
 if i had sent for him to be present and he had come i would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice
 for i would be crushed by his storm my wounds would be increased without cause
 he would not let me take my breath but i would be full of bitter grief
 if it is a question of strength he says here i am  and if it is a question of a cause at law he says who will give me a fixed day
 though i was in the right he would say that i was in the wrong i have done no evil but he says that i am a sinner
 i have done no wrong i give no thought to what becomes of me i have no desire for life
 it is all the same to me so i say he puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together
 if death comes suddenly through disease he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong
 the land is given into the power of the evil doer the faces of its judges are covered if not by him then who has done it
 my days go quicker than a post runner they go in flight they see no good
 they go rushing on like reed boats like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food
 if i say i will put my grief out of mind i will let my face be sad no longer and i will be bright
 i go in fear of all my pains i am certain that i will not be free from sin in your eyes
 you will not let me be clear of sin  why then do i take trouble for nothing
 if i am washed with snow water and make my hands clean with soap
 then you will have me pushed into the dust so that i will seem disgusting to my very clothing
 for he is not a man as i am that i might give him an answer that we might come together before a judge
 there is no one to give a decision between us who might have control over us
 let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me
 then i would say what is in my mind without fear of him for there is no cause of fear in myself
 the word of the lord which came to joel the son of pethuel
 give ear to this you old men and take note you people of the land has this ever been in your days or in the days of your fathers
 give the story of it to your children and let them give it to their children and their children to another generation
 what the worm did not make a meal of has been taken by the locust and what the locust did not take has been food for the plant worm and what the plant worm did not take has been food for the field fly
 come out of your sleep you who are overcome with wine and give yourselves to weeping give cries of sorrow all you drinkers of wine because of the sweet wine for it has been cut off from your mouths
 for a nation has come up over my land strong and without number his teeth are the teeth of a lion and he has the back teeth of a great lion
 by him my vine is made waste and my fig tree broken he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the earth its branches are made white
 make sounds of grief like a virgin dressed in haircloth for the husband of her early years
 the meal offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of the lord the priests the lords servants are sorrowing
 the fields are wasted the land has become dry for the grain is wasted the new wine is kept back the oil is poor
 the farmers are shamed the workers in the vine gardens give cries of grief for the wheat and the barley for the produce of the fields has come to destruction
 the vine has become dry and the fig tree is feeble the pomegranate and the palm tree and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are dry because joy has gone from the sons of men
 put haircloth round you and give yourselves to sorrow you priests give cries of grief you servants of the altar come in and clothed in haircloth let the night go past you servants of my god for the meal offering and the drink offering have been kept back from the house of your god
 let a time be fixed for going without food have a holy meeting let the old men even all the people of the land come together to the house of the lord your god crying out to the lord
 sorrow for the day  for the day of the lord is near and as destruction from the ruler of all it will come
 is not food cut off before our eyes joy and delight from the house of our god
 the grains have become small and dry under the spade the store houses are made waste the grain stores are broken down for the grain is dry and dead
 what sounds of pain come from the beasts  the herds of cattle are at a loss because there is no grass for them even the flocks of sheep are no longer to be seen
 o lord my cry goes up to you for fire has put an end to the grass lands of the waste and all the trees of the field are burned with its flame
 the beasts of the field are turning to you with desire for the water streams are dry and fire has put an end to the grass lands of the waste
 let the horn be sounded in zion and a war cry in my holy mountain let all the people of the land be troubled for the day of the lord is coming
 for a day of dark and deep shade is near a day of cloud and black night like a black cloud a great and strong people is covering the mountains there has never been any like them and will not be after them again from generation to generation
 before them fire sends destruction and after them flame is burning the land is like the garden of eden before them and after them an unpeopled waste truly nothing has been kept safe from them
 their form is like the form of horses and they are running like war horses
 like the sound of war carriages they go jumping on the tops of the mountains like the noise of a flame of fire burning up the grain stems like a strong people lined up for the fight
 at their coming the people are bent with pain all faces become red together
 they are running like strong men they go over the wall like men of war every man goes straight on his way their lines are not broken
 no one is pushing against another everyone goes straight on his way bursting through the sword points their order is not broken
 they make a rush on the town running on the wall they go up into the houses and in through the windows like a thief
 the earth is troubled before them and the heavens are shaking the sun and the moon have become dark and the stars keep back their shining
 and the lord is thundering before his forces for very great is his army for he is strong who gives effect to his word for the day of the lord is great and greatly to be feared and who has strength against it
 but even now says the lord come back to me with all your heart keeping from food with weeping and with sorrow
 let your hearts be broken and not your clothing and come back to the lord your god for he is full of grace and pity slow to be angry and great in mercy ready to be turned from his purpose of punishment
 may it not be that he will again let his purpose be changed and let a blessing come after him even a meal offering and a drink offering for the lord your god
 let a horn be sounded in zion let a time be fixed for going without food have a holy meeting
 get the people together make the mass of the people holy send for the old men get together the children and babies at the breast let the newly married man come out of his room and the bride from her tent
 let the priests the servants of the lord be weeping between the covered way and the altar and let them say have mercy on your people o lord do not give up your heritage to shame so that the nations become their rulers why let them say among the peoples where is their god
 then the lord had a care for the honour of his land and had pity on his people
 and the lord made answer and said to his people see i will send you grain and wine and oil in full measure and i will no longer let you be shamed among the nations
 i will send the one from the north far away from you driving him into a dry and waste land with his front to the sea of the east and his back to the sea of the west and the smell of him will go up even his evil smell will go up
 have no fear o land be glad with great joy for the lord has done great things
 have no fear you beasts of the field for the grass lands of the waste are becoming green for the trees are producing fruit the fig tree and the vine give out their strength
 be glad then you children of zion and have joy in the lord your god for he gives you food in full measure making the rain come down for you the early and the late rain as at the first
 and the floors will be full of grain and the crushing places overflowing with wine and oil
 i will give back to you the years which were food for the locust the plant worm the field fly and the worm my great army which i sent among you
 you will have food in full measure and give praise to the name of the lord your god who has done wonders for you
 and you will be certain that i am in israel and that i am the lord your god and there is no other and my people will never be shamed
 and after that it will come about says the lord that i will send my spirit on all flesh and your sons and your daughters will be prophets your old men will have dreams your young men will see visions
 and on the servants and the servant girls in those days i will send my spirit
 and i will let wonders be seen in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke
 the sun will be made dark and the moon turned to blood before the great day of the lord comes a day to be feared
 and it will be that whoever makes his prayer to the name of the lord will be kept safe for in mount zion and in jerusalem some will be kept safe as the lord has said and will be among the small band marked out by the lord
 for in those days and in that time when i let the fate of judah and jerusalem be changed
 i will get together all the nations and make them come down into the valley of jehoshaphat and there i will take up with them the cause of my people and of my heritage israel whom they have sent wandering among the nations and of my land which has been parted by them
 and they have put the fate of my people to the decision of chance giving a boy for the price of a loose woman and a girl for a drink of wine
 and further what are you to me o tyre and zidon and all the circle of philistia will you give me back any payment and if you do quickly and suddenly i will send it back on your head
 for you have taken my silver and my gold putting in the houses of your gods my beautiful and pleasing things
 and the children of judah and the children of jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the greeks to send them far away from their land
 see i will have them moved from the place where you have sent them and will let what you have done come back on your head
 i will give your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of judah for a price and they will give them for a price to the men of sheba a nation far off for the lord has said it
 give this out among the nations make ready for war get the strong men awake let all the men of war come near let them come up
 get your plough blades hammered into swords and your vine knives into spears let the feeble say i am strong
 come quickly all you nations round about and get yourselves together there make your strong ones come down o lord
 let the nations be awake and come to the valley of jehoshaphat for there i will be seated as judge of all the nations round about
 put in the blade for the grain is ready come get you down for the wine crusher is full the vessels are overflowing for great is their evil doing
 masses on masses in the valley of decision  for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision
 the sun and the moon have become dark and the stars keep back their shining
 and the lord will be thundering from zion and his voice will be sounding from jerusalem and the heavens and the earth will be shaking but the lord will be a breastplate for his people and a strong place for the children of israel
 and you will be certain that i am the lord your god living in zion my holy mountain and jerusalem will be holy and no strange person will ever again go through her
 and it will come about in that day that the mountains will be dropping sweet wine and the hills will be flowing with milk and all the streams of judah will be flowing with water and a fountain will come out from the house of the lord watering the valley of acacia trees
 egypt will be a waste and edom a land of destruction because of the evil done to the children of judah because they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause
 but judah will be peopled for ever and jerusalem from generation to generation
 and i will send punishment for their blood for which punishment has not been sent for the lord is living in zion
 and the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amittai saying
 up  go to nineveh that great town and let your voice come to it for their evil doing has come up before me
 and jonah got up to go in flight to tarshish away from the lord and he went down to joppa and saw there a ship going to tarshish so he gave them the price of the journey and went down into it to go with them to tarshish away from the lord
 and the lord sent out a great wind on to the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea so that the ship seemed in danger of being broken
 then the sailors were full of fear every man crying to his god and the goods in the ship were dropped out into the sea to make the weight less but jonah had gone down into the inmost part of the ship where he was stretched out in a deep sleep
 and the ships captain came to him and said to him what are you doing sleeping up  say a prayer to your god if by chance god will give a thought to us so that we may not come to destruction
 and they said to one another come let us put this to the decision of chance and see on whose account this evil has come on us so they did so and jonah was seen to be the man
 then they said to him now make clear to us what is your work and where you come from what is your country and who are your people
 and he said to them i am a hebrew a worshipper of the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the dry land
 and the men were in great fear and they said to him what is this you have done for the men had knowledge of his flight from the lord because he had not kept it from them
 and they said to him what are we to do to you so that the sea may become calm for us for the sea was getting rougher and rougher
 and he said to them take me up and put me into the sea and the sea will become calm for you for i am certain that because of me this great storm has come on you
 and the men were working hard to get back to the land but they were not able to do so for the sea got rougher and rougher against them
 so crying to the lord they said give ear to our prayer o lord give ear and do not let destruction overtake us because of this mans life do not put on us the sin of taking life without cause for you o lord have done what seemed good to you
 so they took jonah up and put him into the sea and the sea was no longer angry
 then great was the mens fear of the lord and they made an offering to the lord and took oaths to him
 and the lord made ready a great fish to take jonah into its mouth and jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights
 then jonah made prayer to the lord his god from the inside of the fish and said
 in my trouble i was crying to the lord and he gave me an answer out of the deepest underworld i sent up a cry and you gave ear to my voice
 for you have put me down into the deep into the heart of the sea and the river was round about me all your waves and your rolling waters went over me
 and i said i have been sent away from before your eyes how may i ever again see your holy temple
 the waters were circling round me even to the neck the deep was about me the sea grass was twisted round my head
 i went down to the bases of the mountains as for the earth her walls were about me for ever but you have taken up my life from the underworld o lord my god
 when my soul in me was overcome i kept the memory of the lord and my prayer came in to you into your holy temple
 the worshippers of false gods have given up their only hope
 but i will make an offering to you with the voice of praise i will give effect to my oaths salvation is the lords
 and at the lords order the fish sent jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land
 and the word of the lord came to jonah a second time saying
 up  go to nineveh that great town and give it the word which i have given you
 so jonah got up and went to nineveh as the lord had said now nineveh was a very great town three days journey from end to end
 and jonah first of all went a days journey into the town and crying out said in forty days destruction will overtake nineveh
 and the people of nineveh had belief in god and a time was fixed for going without food and they put on haircloth from the greatest to the least
 and the word came to the king of nineveh and he got up from his seat of authority and took off his robe and covering himself with haircloth took his seat in the dust
 and he had it given out in nineveh by the order of the king and his great men no man or beast herd or flock is to have a taste of anything let them have no food or water
 and let man and beast be covered with haircloth and let them make strong prayers to god and let everyone be turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands
 who may say that god will not be turned changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath so that destruction may not overtake us
 and god saw what they did how they were turned from their evil way and gods purpose was changed as to the evil which he said he would do to them and he did it not
 but this seemed very wrong to jonah and he was angry
 and he made prayer to the lord and said o lord is this not what i said when i was still in my country this is why i took care to go in flight to tarshish for i was certain that you were a loving god full of pity slow to be angry and great in mercy and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil
 so now o lord give ear to my prayer and take my life from me for death is better for me than life
 and the lord said have you any right to be angry
 then jonah went out of the town and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town
 and the lord god made a vine come up over jonah to give him shade over his head and jonah was very glad because of the vine
 but early on the morning after god made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine and it became dry and dead
 then when the sun came up god sent a burning east wind and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that jonah was overcome and requesting death for himself said death is better for me than life
 and the lord said to jonah have you any right to be angry about the vine and he said i have a right to be truly angry
 and the lord said you had pity on the vine for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible which came up in a night and came to an end in a night
 and am i not to have mercy on nineveh that great town in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left as well as much cattle
 now after the death of moses the servant of the lord the word of the lord came to joshua the son of nun moses helper saying
 moses my servant is dead so now get up  go over jordan you and all this people into the land which i am giving to them to the children of israel
 every place on which you put your foot i have given to you as i said to moses
 from the waste land and this mountain lebanon as far as the great river the river euphrates and all the land of the hittites to the great sea in the west will be your country
 while you are living all will give way before you as i was with moses so i will be with you i will not take away my help from you or give you up
 take heart and be strong for you will give to this people for their heritage the land which i gave by an oath to their fathers
 only take heart and be very strong take care to do all the law which moses my servant gave you not turning from it to the right hand or to the left so that you may do well in all your undertakings
 let this book of the law be ever on your lips and in your thoughts day and night so that you may keep with care everything in it then a blessing will be on all your way and you will do well
 have i not given you your orders take heart and be strong have no fear and do not be troubled for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
 then joshua gave their orders to those who were in authority over the people saying
 go through the tents and give orders to the people saying get ready a store of food for in three days you are to go over this river jordan and take for your heritage the land which the lord your god is giving you
 and to the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh joshua said
 keep in mind what moses the servant of the lord said to you the lord your god is sending you rest and will give you this land
 your wives your little ones and your cattle will be kept here in the land which moses gave you on this side of jordan but you the fighting men are to go over before your brothers armed to give them help
 till the lord has given your brothers rest as he has given it to you and they have taken their heritage in the land which the lord your god is giving them then you will go back to the land of your heritage which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the east side of jordan
 then they said to joshua in answer whatever you say to us we will do and wherever you send us we will go
 as we gave attention to moses in all things so we will give attention to you and may the lord your god be with you as he was with moses
 whoever goes against your orders and does not give attention to all your words will be put to death only take heart and be strong
 now when it came to the ears of adoni zedek king of jerusalem that joshua had taken ai and had given it up to the curse  for as he had done to jericho and its king so he had done to ai and its king  and that the people of gibeon had made peace with israel and were living among them
 he was in great fear because gibeon was a great town like one of the kings towns greater than ai and all the men in it were men of war
 so adoni zedek king of jerusalem sent to hoham king of hebron and to piram king of jarmuth and to japhia king of lachish and to debir king of eglon saying
 come up to me and give me help and let us make an attack on gibeon for they have made peace with joshua and the children of israel
 so the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon were banded together and went up with all their armies and took up their position before gibeon and made war against it
 and the men of gibeon sent to joshua to the tent circle at gilgal saying be not slow to send help to your servants come up quickly to our support and keep us safe for all the kings of the amorites from the hill country have come together against us
 so joshua went up from gilgal with all his army and all his men of war
 and the lord said to joshua have no fear of them for i have given them into your hands they will all give way before you
 so joshua having come up from gilgal all night made a sudden attack on them
 and the lord made them full of fear before israel and they put great numbers of them to death at gibeon and went after them by the way going up to beth horon driving them back to azekah and makkedah
 and in their flight before israel on the way down from beth horon the lord sent down great stones from heaven on them all the way to azekah causing their death those whose death was caused by the stones were more than those whom the children of israel put to death with the sword
 it was on the day when the lord gave up the amorites into the hands of the children of israel that joshua said to the lord before the eyes of israel sun be at rest over gibeon and you o moon in the valley of aijalon
 and the sun was at rest and the moon kept its place till the nation had given punishment to their attackers  is it not recorded in the book of jashar  so the sun kept its place in the middle of the heavens and was waiting and did not go down for the space of a day
 and there was no day like that before it or after it when the lord gave ear to the voice of a man for the lord was fighting for israel
 and joshua with all israel went back to the tent circle at gilgal
 but these five kings went in flight secretly to a hole in the rock at makkedah
 and word was given to joshua that the five kings had been taken in a hole in the rock at makkedah
 and joshua said let great stones be rolled against the mouth of the hole and let men keep watch by it
 but do you without waiting go after their army attacking them from the back do not let them get into their towns for the lord your god has given them into your hands
 now when joshua and the children of israel had come to the end of their war of complete destruction and had put to death all but a small band who had got safely into the walled towns
 all the people went back to joshua to the tent circle at makkedah in peace and no one said a word against the children of israel
 then joshua said take away the stones from the mouth of the hole in the rock and make those five kings come out to me
 and they did so and made those five kings come out of the hole to him the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon
 and when they had made those kings come out to joshua joshua sent for all the men of israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him come near and put your feet on the necks of these kings so they came near and put their feet on their necks
 and joshua said to them have no fear and do not be troubled be strong and take heart for so will the lord do to all against whom you make war
 then joshua had them put to death hanging them on five trees where they were till evening
 and when the sun went down they were taken down from the trees by joshuas orders and put into the hole where they had gone to be safe and great stones were placed at the mouth of the hole where they are to this day
 that day joshua took makkedah and put it and its king to the sword every soul in it he gave up to the curse without mercy and he did to the king of makkedah as he had done to the king of jericho
 then joshua and all israel with him went on from makkedah and came to libnah and made an attack on it
 and again the lord gave it and its king into the hands of israel and he put it and every person in it to the sword till their destruction was complete and he did to its king as he had done to the king of jericho
 then joshua and all israel with him went on from libnah to lachish and took up their position against it and made an attack on it
 and the lord gave lachish into the hands of israel and on the second day he took it putting it and every person in it to the sword without mercy as he had done to libnah
 then horam king of gezer came up to the help of lachish and joshua overcame him and his people putting all of them to death
 and joshua and all israel with him went on from lachish to eglon and they took up their position against it and made an attack on it
 and that day they took it putting it and every person in it to the sword as he had done to lachish
 and joshua and all israel with him went up from eglon to hebron and made an attack on it
 and took it overcoming it and putting it and its king and its towns and every person in it to the sword as he had done to eglon he put them all to death and gave it up to the curse with every person in it
 and joshua and all israel with him went on to make an attack on debir
 and he took it with its king and all its towns and he put them to the sword giving every person in it to the curse all were put to death as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and its king
 so joshua overcame all the land the hill country and the south and the lowland and the mountain slopes and all their kings all were put to death and every living thing he gave up to the curse as the lord the god of israel had given him orders
 joshua overcame them from kadesh barnea to gaza and all the land of goshen as far as gibeon
 and all these kings and their land joshua took at the same time because the lord the god of israel was fighting for israel
 then joshua and all israel with him went back to their tents at gilgal
 now jabin king of hazor hearing of these things sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of shimron and to the king of achshaph
 and to the kings on the north in the hill country and in the arabah south of chinneroth and in the lowland and in the highlands of dor on the west
 and to the canaanites on the east and on the west and to the amorites and the hittites and the perizzites and the jebusites in the hill country and the hivites under hermon in the land of mizpah
 and they went out they and all their armies with them a great people in number like the sand on the seaside with horses and war carriages in great number
 and all these kings came together and put their forces in position at the waters of merom to make war on israel
 and the lord said to joshua have no fear of them for tomorrow at this time i will give them all up dead before israel you are to have the leg muscles of their horses cut and their war carriages burned with fire
 so joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of merom and made an attack on them
 and the lord gave them up into the hands of israel and they overcame them driving them back to great zidon and to misrephoth maim and into the valley of mizpeh to the east and they put them all to death no man got away safely
 and joshua did to them as the lord had said to him he had the leg muscles of their horses cut and their war carriages burned with fire
 at that time joshua went on to take hazor and put its king to the sword for in earlier times hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms
 and they put every person in it to death without mercy giving every living thing up to the curse and burning hazor
 and all the towns of these kings and all the kings joshua took and put them to the sword he gave them up to the curse as moses the servant of the lord had said
 as for the towns made on hills of earth not one was burned by israel but hazor which was burned by joshua
 and all the goods taken from these towns and their cattle the children of israel kept for themselves but every man they put to death without mercy till their destruction was complete and there was no one living
 as the lord had given orders to moses his servant so moses gave orders to joshua and so joshua did every order which the lord had given to moses was done
 so joshua took all that land the hill country and all the south and all the land of goshen and the lowland and the arabah the hill country of israel and its lowland
 from mount halak which goes up to seir as far as baal gad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he overcame and put to death
 for a long time joshua made war on all those kings
 not one town made peace with the children of israel but only the hivites of gibeon they took them all in war
 for the lord made them strong in heart to go to war against israel so that he might give them up to the curse without mercy and that destruction might come on them as the lord had given orders to moses
 and joshua came at that time and put an end to the anakim in the hill country in hebron in debir in anab and in all the hill country of judah and israel joshua gave them and their towns to the curse
 not one of the anakim was to be seen in the land of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod some were still living
 so joshua took all the land as the lord had said to moses and joshua gave it to the children of israel as their heritage making division of it among them by their tribes and the land had rest from war
 now these are the kings of the land whom the children of israel overcame taking as their heritage their land on the east side of jordan from the valley of the arnon to mount hermon and all the arabah to the east
 sihon king of the amorites who was living in heshbon ruling from aroer which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon and the town in the middle of the valley and half gilead as far as the river jabbok the limits of the children of ammon
 and the arabah to the sea of chinneroth to the east and to the sea of the arabah that is the salt sea to the east the way to beth jeshimoth and on the south under the slopes of pisgah
 and the land of og king of bashan of the rest of the rephaim who was living at ashtaroth and at edrei
 ruling in the mountain of hermon and in salecah and in all bashan as far as the limits of the geshurites and the maacathites and half gilead to the land of sihon king of heshbon
 moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel overcame them and moses the servant of the lord gave their land for a heritage to the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
 and these are the kings of the land whom joshua and the children of israel overcame on the west side of jordan from baal gad in the valley of lebanon to mount halak which goes up to seir and joshua gave the land to the tribes of israel for a heritage in keeping with their divisions
 in the hill country and in the lowland and in the arabah and on the mountain slopes and in the waste land and in the south the hittites the amorites and the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites
 the king of jericho one the king of ai which is near beth el one
 the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one
 the king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one
 the king of eglon one the king of gezer one
 the king of debir one the king of geder one
 the king of hormah one the king of arad one
 the king of libnah one the king of adullam one
 the king of makkedah one the king of beth el one
 the king of tappuah one the king of hepher one
 the king of aphek one the king of lassharon one
 the king of madon one the king of hazor one
 the king of shimron meron one the king of achshaph one
 the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one
 the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam in carmel one
 the king of dor on the hill of dor one the king of goiim in gilgal one
 the king of tirzah one all the kings together were thirty one
 now joshua was old and full of years and the lord said to him you are old and full of years and there is still very much land to be taken
 this is the land which is still to be taken all the country of the philistines and all the geshurites
 from the shihor which is before egypt to the edge of ekron to the north which is taken to be canaanite property the five chiefs of the philistines the gazites and the ashdodites the ashkelonites the gittites and the ekronites as well as the avvim
 on the south all the land of the canaanites and mearah which is the property of the zidonians to aphek as far as the limit of the amorites
 and the land of the gebalites and all lebanon looking east from baal gad under mount hermon as far as hamath
 all the people of the hill country from lebanon to misrephoth maim all the zidonians them will i send out from before the children of israel only make division of it to israel for a heritage as i have given you orders to do
 so now make division of this land for a heritage to the nine tribes and the half tribe of manasseh
 with him the reubenites and the gadites have been given their heritage which moses gave them on the east side of jordan as moses the servant of the lord gave them
 from aroer on the edge of the valley of the arnon and the town in the middle of the valley and all the table land from medeba to dibon
 and all the towns of sihon king of the amorites who was ruling in heshbon to the limits of the children of ammon
 and gilead and the land of the geshurites and the maacathites and all mount hermon and all bashan to salecah
 all the kingdom of og in bashan who was ruling in ashtaroth and in edrei  he was one of the last of the rephaim  these did moses overcome driving them out of their country
 however the people of israel did not send out the geshurites or the maacathites but geshur and maacath are living among israel to this day
 only to the tribe of levi he gave no heritage the offerings of the lord the god of israel made by fire are his heritage as he said to him
 and moses gave their heritage to the tribe of reuben by their families
 their limit was from aroer on the edge of the valley of the arnon and the town in the middle of the valley and all the table land by medeba
 heshbon and all her towns in the table land dibon and bamoth baal and beth baal meon
 and jahaz and kedemoth and mephaath
 and kiriathaim and sibmah and zereth shahar in the mountain of the valley
 and beth peor and the slopes of pisgah and beth jeshimoth
 and all the towns of the table land and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites who was ruling in heshbon whom moses overcame together with the chiefs of midian evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba the chiefs of sihon who were living in the land
 and balaam the son of beor the prophet the children of israel put to death with the sword
 and the limit of the children of reuben was the edge of jordan this was the heritage of the children of reuben by their families with its towns and its unwalled places
 and moses gave their heritage to the tribe of gad by their families
 and their limit was jazer and all the towns of gilead and half the land of the children of ammon to aroer before rabbah
 and from heshbon to ramath mizpeh and betonim and from mahanaim to the edge of debir
 and in the valley beth haram and beth nimrah and succoth and zaphon the rest of the kingdom of sihon king of heshbon having jordan for its limit to the end of the sea of chinnereth on the east side of jordan
 this is the heritage of the children of gad by their families with its towns and its unwalled places
 and moses gave their heritage to the half tribe of manasseh by their families
 and their limit was from mahanaim all bashan all the kingdom of og king of bashan and all havvoth jair in bashan sixty towns
 and half gilead and ashtaroth and edrei towns of the kingdom of og in bashan were for the children of machir the son of manasseh for half of the children of machir by their families
 these are the heritages of which moses made distribution in the lowlands of moab on the other side of jordan in jericho to the east
 but to the tribe of levi moses gave no heritage the lord the god of israel is their heritage as he said to them
 and these are the heritages which the children of israel took in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the tribes of the children of israel gave out to them
 their heritage by the lords decision as he gave orders by moses for the nine tribes and the half tribe
 for moses had given their heritage to the two tribes and the half tribe on the other side of jordan but to the levites he gave no heritage among them
 because the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim and they gave the levites no part in the land only towns for their living places with the grass lands for their cattle and for their property
 as the lord had given orders to moses so the people of israel did and they made division of the land
 then the children of judah went to joshua in gilgal and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite said to him you have knowledge of what the lord said to moses the man of god about me and about you in kadesh barnea
 i was forty years old when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnea to make a search through the land and the account which i gave him was in keeping with his desire
 my brothers however who went up with me made the heart of the people like water but i was true to the lord with all my heart
 and on that day moses took an oath saying truly the land where your feet have been placed will become a heritage for you and your children for ever because you have been true to the lord your god with all your heart
 and now as you see the lord has kept me safe these forty five years from the time when the lord said this to moses while israel was wandering in the waste land and now i am eighty five years old
 and still i am as strong today as i was when moses sent me out as my strength was then so is it now for war and for all the business of life
 so now give me this hill country named by the lord at that time for you had an account of it then how the anakim were there and great walled towns it may be that the lord will be with me and i will be able to take their land as the lord said
 and joshua gave him his blessing and he gave hebron to caleb the son of jephunneh for his heritage
 so hebron became the heritage of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite to this day because with all his heart he was true to the lord the god of israel
 in earlier times the name of hebron had been kiriath arba named after arba the greatest of the anakim and the land had rest from war
 now the part of the land marked out for the children of judah by families went up to the edge of edom as far as the waste land of zin to the south to the farthest point of it on the south
 their south limit was from the farthest part of the salt sea from the inlet looking to the south
 from there it goes south of the slope up to akrabbim and on to zin then south past kadesh barnea and on by hezron and up to addar turning in the direction of karka
 then on to azmon ending at the stream of egypt and the end of the limit is at the sea this will be your limit on the south
 and the east limit is the salt sea as far as the end of jordan and the limit of the north part of the land is from the inlet of the sea at the end of jordan
 then the line goes up to beth hoglah past the north of beth arabah and up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben
 then the line goes up to debir from the valley of achor and so to the north in the direction of gilgal which is opposite the slope up to adummim on the south side of the river and the line goes on to the waters of en shemesh ending at en rogel
 then the line goes up by the valley of the son of hinnom to the south side of the jebusite  which is jerusalem  then up to the top of the mountain in front of the valley of hinnom to the west which is at the farthest point of the valley of rephaim on the north
 and the limit is marked out from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the waters of nephtoah and out to the towns of mount ephron as far as baalah  which is kiriath jearim 
 then turning west the line goes from baalah to mount seir and on to the side of mount jearim  which is chesalon  on the north then down to beth shemesh and on past timnah
 and out to the side of ekron to the north then it is marked out to shikkeron and on to mount baalah ending at jabneel the end of the line is at the sea
 and the limit on the west is the edge of the great sea this is the line going round the land marked out for the children of judah by their families
 and to caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the children of judah as the lord had given orders to joshua that is kiriath arba named after arba the father of anak which is hebron
 and the three sons of anak sheshai and ahiman and talmai the children of anak were forced out from there by caleb
 from there he went up against the people of debir  now the name of debir before that was kiriath sepher 
 and caleb said i will give achsah my daughter as wife to the man who overcomes kiriath sepher and takes it
 and othniel the son of kenaz calebs brother took it so he gave him his daughter achsah for his wife
 now when she came to him he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father and she got down from her ass and caleb said to her what is it
 and she said give me a blessing because you have put me in dry south land now give me springs of water so he gave her the higher spring and the lower spring
 this is the heritage of the tribe of judah by their families

 in the waste land beth arabah middin and secacah
 and nibshan and the town of salt and en gedi six towns with their unwalled places
 and as for the jebusites living in jerusalem the children of judah were unable to make them go out but the jebusites are living with the children of judah at jerusalem to this day
 and the limit of the land marked out for the children of joseph went out from jordan at jericho at the waters of jericho on the east in the waste land going up from jericho through the hill country to beth el
 and it goes out from beth el to luz and on as far as the limit of the archites to ataroth
 and it goes down to the west to the limit of the japhletites to the limit of beth horon the lower as far as gezer ending at the sea
 and the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their heritage
 and the limit of the land of the children of ephraim by their families was marked out in this way the limit of their heritage to the east was ataroth addar to beth horon the higher
 the line goes out to the west at michmethath on the north then turning to the east to taanath shiloh going past it on the east of janoah
 and from janoah down to ataroth and to naarah and touching jericho it goes on to jordan
 from tappuah the line goes on to the west to the river of kanah ending at the sea this is the heritage of the children of ephraim by their families
 together with the towns marked out for the children of ephraim in the heritage of manasseh all the towns with their unwalled places
 and the canaanites who were living in gezer were not forced out but the canaanites have been living among ephraim to this day as servants doing forced work
 and this was the part marked out for the tribe of manasseh because he was the oldest son of joseph as for machir the oldest son of manasseh the father of gilead because he was a man of war he had gilead and bashan
 and as for the rest of the children of manasseh their heritage was given to them by families for the children of abiezer and for the children of helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by their families
 but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh had no sons but only daughters and these are the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and tirzah
 and they came before eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and before the chiefs saying the lord gave orders to moses to give us a heritage among our brothers so in agreement with the orders of the lord he gave them a heritage among their fathers brothers
 and ten parts were given to manasseh in addition to the land of gilead and bashan which is on the other side of jordan
 because the daughters of manasseh had a heritage among his sons and the land of gilead was the property of the other sons of manasseh
 and the limit of manassehs land was from asher to michmethath which is before shechem the line goes on to the right hand to the people of en tappuah
 the land of tappuah was the property of manasseh but tappuah on the edge of manasseh was the property of the children of ephraim
 and the limit goes down to the stream kanah to the south of the stream these towns were ephraims among the towns of manasseh manassehs limit was on the north side of the stream ending at the sea
 to the south it is ephraims and to the north it is manassehs and the sea is his limit and they are touching asher on the north and issachar on the east
 in issachar and asher manasseh had beth shean and its daughter towns and ibleam and its daughter towns and the people of dor and its daughter towns and the people of en dor and its daughter towns and the people of taanach and its daughter towns and the people of megiddo and its daughter towns that is the three hills
 but the children of manasseh were not able to make the people of those towns go out but the canaanites would go on living in that land
 and when the children of israel had become strong they put the canaanites to forced work in place of driving them out
 then the children of joseph said to joshua why have you given me only one part and one stretch of land for my heritage for through the blessing given to me by the lord up to now i am a great people
 then joshua said to them if you are such a great people go up into the woodlands clearing a place there for yourselves in the land of the perizzites and the rephaim if the hill country of ephraim is not wide enough for you
 and the children of joseph said the hill country is not enough for us and all the canaanites living in the valley have iron war carriages those in beth shean and its towns as well as those in the valley of jezreel
 then joshua said to the children of joseph to ephraim and manasseh you are a great people and have great power you are not to have one property only
 for the hill country of gilead will be yours  the woodland and cut down  its outskirts will be yours  get the canaanites out for they have iron war carriages  strong
 and all the meeting of the children of israel came together at shiloh and put up the tent of meeting there and the land was crushed before them
 but there were still seven tribes among the children of israel who had not taken up their heritage
 then joshua said to the children of israel why are you so slow to go in and take up your heritage in the land which the lord the god of your fathers has given you
 take from among you three men from every tribe and i will send them to go through the land and make a record of it for distribution as their heritage then let them come back to me
 and let them make division of it into seven parts let judah keep inside his limit on the south and let the children of joseph keep inside their limit on the north
 and you are to have the land marked out in seven parts and come back to me with the record and i will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the lord our god
 for the levites have no part among you to be the lords priests is their heritage and gad and reuben and the half tribe of manasseh have had their heritage on the east side of jordan given to them by moses the servant of the lord
 so the men got up and went and joshua gave orders to those who went to make a record of the land saying go up and down through the land and make a record of it and come back here to me and i will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the lord in shiloh
 so the men went travelling through the land and made a record of it by towns in seven parts in a book and came back to joshua to the tent circle at shiloh
 and joshua made the distribution for them in shiloh by the decision of the lord marking out the land for the children of israel by their divisions

 and all the unwalled places round about these towns as far as baalath beer ramah to the south this is the heritage of the tribe of simeon by their families

 and eltekeh and gibbethon and baalath
 and jehud and bene berak and gath rimmon
 and on the west was  opposite joppa
  but the limit of the children of dan was not wide enough for them so the children of dan went up and made war on leshem and took it putting it to the sword without mercy and they took it for their heritage and made a place for themselves there giving it the name of leshem dan after the name of their father dan 
 this is the heritage of the tribe of the children of dan by their families these towns with their unwalled places
 so the distribution of the land and its limits was complete and the children of israel gave joshua the son of nun a heritage among them
 by the orders of the lord they gave him the town for which he made request timnath serah in the hill country of ephraim there after building the town he made his living place
 these are the heritages which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of families of the tribes of the children of israel gave out at shiloh by the decision of the lord at the door of the tent of meeting so the distribution of the land was complete
 then joshua the son of nun sent two men from shittim secretly with the purpose of searching out the land and jericho so they went and came to the house of a loose woman of the town named rahab where they took their rest for the night
 and it was said to the king of jericho see some men have come here tonight from the children of israel with the purpose of searching out the land
 then the king of jericho sent to rahab saying send out the men who have come to you and are in your house for they have come with the purpose of searching out all the land
 and the woman took the two men and put them in a secret place then she said yes the men came to me but i had no idea where they came from
 and when it was the time for shutting the doors at dark they went out i have no idea where the men went but if you go after them quickly you will overtake them
 but she had taken them up to the roof covering them with the stems of flax which she had put out in order there
 so the men went after them on the road to jordan as far as the river crossing and when they had gone out after them the door into the town was shut
 and before the men went to rest she came up to them on the roof
 and said to them it is clear to me that the lord has given you the land and that the fear of you has come on us
 for we have had news of how the lord made the red sea dry before you when you came out of egypt and what you did to the two kings of the amorites on the other side of jordan to sihon and og whom you gave up to the curse
 and because of this news our hearts became like water and there was no more spirit in any of us because of you for the lord your god is god in heaven on high and here on earth
 so now will you give me your oath by the lord that because i have been kind to you you will be kind to my fathers house
 and that you will keep safe my father and mother and my brothers and sisters and all they have so that death may not come on us
 and the men said to her our life for yours if you keep our business secret and when the lord has given us the land we will keep faith and be kind to you
 then she let them down from the window by a cord for the house where she was living was on the town wall
 and she said to them get away into the hill country or the men who have gone after you will overtake you keep yourselves safe there for three days till the searchers have come back and then go on your way
 and the men said to her we will only be responsible for this oath which you have made us take
 if when we come into the land you put this cord of bright red thread in the window from which you let us down and get your father and mother and your brothers and all your family into the house
 then if anyone goes out of your house into the street his blood will be on his head we will not be responsible but if any damage comes to anyone in the house his blood will be on our heads
 but if you say anything about our business here then we will be free from the oath you have made us take
 and she said let it be as you say then she sent them away and they went and she put the bright red cord in the window
 and they went into the hill country and were there three days till the men who had gone after them had come back and those who went after them were searching for them everywhere without coming across them
 then the two men came down from the hill country and went over and came back to joshua the son of nun and they gave him a complete account of what had taken place
 and they said to joshua truly the lord has given all the land into our hands and all the people of the land have become like water because of us
 and the lord said to joshua
 say to the children of israel let certain towns be marked out as safe places as i said to you by the mouth of moses
 so that any man who in error and without design has taken the life of another may go in flight to them and they will be safe places for you from him who has the right of punishment for blood
 and if anyone goes in flight to one of those towns and comes into the public place of the town and puts his cause before the responsible men of the town they will take him into the town and give him a place among them where he may be safe
 and if the one who has the right of punishment comes after him they are not to give the taker of life up to him because he was the cause of his neighbours death without designing it and not in hate
 and he is to go on living in that town till he has to come before the meeting of the people to be judged  till the death of him who is high priest at that time  then the taker of life may come back to his town and to his house to the town from which he had gone in flight
 so they made selection of kedesh in galilee in the hill country of naphtali and shechem in the hill country of ephraim and kiriath arba  which is hebron  in the hill country of judah
 and on the east side of jordan at jericho they made selection of bezer in the waste land in the table land out of the tribe of reuben and ramoth in gilead out of the tribe of gad and golan in bashan out of the tribe of manasseh
 these were the towns marked out for all the children of israel and for the man from a strange country living among them so that anyone causing the death of another in error might go in flight there and not be put to death by him who has the right of punishment for blood till he had come before the meeting of the people
 then the heads of the families of the levites came to eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and to the heads of families of the tribes of the children of israel
 and said to them in shiloh in the land of canaan the lord gave orders by moses that we were to have towns for living in with their grass lands for our cattle
 and the children of israel out of their heritage gave to the levites these towns with their grass lands by the order of the lord
 and the heritage came out for the families of the kohathites the children of aaron the priest who were of the levites were given thirteen towns from the tribes of judah simeon and benjamin
 the rest of the children of kohath by their families were given ten towns from the tribes of ephraim and dan and the half tribe of manasseh

 these were for the children of aaron among the families of the kohathites of the children of levi for they came first in the distribution

 thirteen towns with their grass lands were given to the children of aaron the priests

 and they gave them shechem with its grass lands in the hill country of ephraim the town where the taker of life might be safe and gezer with its grass lands
 and kibzaim and beth horon with their grass lands four towns
 and from the tribe of dan elteke and gibbethon with their grass lands
 aijalon and gath rimmon with their grass lands four towns
 and from the half tribe of manasseh taanach and gath rimmon with their grass lands two towns
 all the towns of the rest of the families of the children of kohath were ten with their grass lands
 and to the children of gershon of the families of the levites they gave from the half tribe of manasseh golan in bashan with its grass lands the town where the taker of life might be safe and ashtaroth with its grass lands two towns
 and from the tribe of issachar kishion and daberath with their grass lands
 jarmuth and en gannim with their grass lands four towns
 and from the tribe of asher mishal and abdon with their grass lands
 helkath and rehob with their grass lands four towns
 and from the tribe of naphtali kedesh in galilee with its grass lands the town where the taker of life might be safe and hammoth dor and kartan with their grass lands three towns
 all the towns of the gershonites with their families were thirteen with their grass lands
 and to the rest of the levites that is the families of the children of merari they gave from the tribe of zebulun jokneam and kartah with their grass lands
 dimnah and nahalal with their grass lands four towns
 and from the tribe of reuben bezer and jahaz with their grass lands
 kedemoth and mephaath with their grass lands four towns
 and from the tribe of gad ramoth in gilead the town where the taker of life might be safe and mahanaim with their grass lands
 heshbon and jazer with their grass lands four towns
 all these towns were given to the children of merari by their families that is the rest of the families of the levites and their heritage was twelve towns
 all the towns of the levites among the heritage of the children of israel were forty eight towns with their grass lands
 every one of these towns had grass lands round it
 so the lord gave to israel all the land which he gave by oath to their fathers so it became their heritage and their living place
 and the lord gave them peace on every side as he had said to their fathers all those who were against them gave way before them for the lord gave them all up into their hands
 the lord kept faith with the house of israel about all the good which he said he would do for them and all his words came true
 then joshua sent for the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
 and said to them you have kept all the orders of moses the lords servant and have done everything i gave you orders to do
 you have now been with your brothers for a long time till this day you have been doing the orders of the lord your god
 and now the lord your god has given your brothers rest as he said so now you may go back to your tents to the land of your heritage which moses the lords servant gave to you on the other side of jordan
 only take great care to do the orders and the law which moses the lords servant gave you to have love for the lord your god and to go in all his ways and to keep his laws and to be true to him and to be his servants with all your heart and with all your soul
 then joshua gave them his blessing and sent them away and they went back to their tents
 now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given a heritage in bashan but to the other half joshua gave a heritage among their brothers on the west side of jordan now when joshua sent them away to their tents he gave them his blessing
 and said to them go back with much wealth to your tents and with very much cattle with silver and gold and brass and iron and with a very great store of clothing give your brothers a part of the goods taken in the war
 so reuben and gad and the half tribe of manasseh went back parting from the children of israel at shiloh in the land of canaan to go to the land of gilead to the land of their heritage which had been given to them by the lords order to moses
 now when they came to the country by jordan in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh put up there by jordan a great altar seen from far
 and news came to the children of israel see the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have put up an altar opposite the land of canaan in the country by jordan on the side which is israels
 then all the meeting of the children of israel hearing this came together at shiloh to go up against them to war
 and the children of israel sent phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh to the land of gilead
 and with him they sent ten chiefs one for every tribe of the children of israel every one of them the head of his house among the families of israel
 and they came to the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh to the land of gilead and said to them
 this is what all the meeting of the people of the lord has said what is this wrong which you have done against the god of israel turning back this day from the lord and building an altar for yourselves and being false to the lord
 was not the sin of baal peor great enough from which we are not clear even to this day though punishment came on the people of the lord
 that now you are turned back from the lord and because you are false to him today tomorrow his wrath will be let loose on all the people of israel
 but if the land you now have is unclean come over into the lords land where his house is and take up your heritage among us but do not be false to the lord and to us by building yourselves an altar in addition to the altar of the lord our god
 did not achan the son of zerah do wrong about the cursed thing causing wrath to come on all the people of israel and not on him only came the punishment of death
 then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh said in answer to the heads of the families of israel
 god even god the lord god even god the lord he sees and israel will see  if it is in pride or in sin against the lord
 that we have made ourselves an altar being false to the lord keep us not safe from death this day and if for the purpose of offering burned offerings on it and meal offerings or peace offerings let the lord himself send punishment for it
 and if we have not in fact done this designedly and with purpose having in our minds the fear that in time to come your children might say to our children what have you to do with the lord the god of israel
 for the lord has made jordan a line of division between us and you the children of reuben and the children of gad you have no part in the lord so your children will make our children give up fearing the lord
 so we said let us now make an altar for ourselves not for burned offerings or for the offerings of beasts
 but to be a witness between us and you and between the future generations that we have the right of worshipping the lord with our burned offerings and our offerings of beasts and our peace offerings so that your children will not be able to say to our children in time to come you have no part in the lord
 for we said to ourselves if they say this to us or to future generations then we will say see this copy of the lords altar which our fathers made not for burned offerings or offerings of beasts but for a witness between us and you
 never let it be said that we were false to the lord turning back this day from him and building an altar for burned offerings and meal offerings and offerings of beasts in addition to the altar of the lord our god which is before his house
 then phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the meeting and the heads of the families of israel who were with him hearing what the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh said were pleased
 and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said to the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh now we are certain that the lord is among us because you have not done this wrong against the lord and you have kept us from falling into the hands of the lord
 then phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the chiefs went back from the land of gilead from the children of reuben and the children of gad and came to the children of israel in canaan and gave them the news
 and the children of israel were pleased about this and they gave praise to god and had no more thought of going to war against the children of reuben and the children of gad for the destruction of their land
 and the children of reuben and the children of gad gave to that altar the name of ed for they said it is a witness between us that the lord is god
 now after a long time when the lord had given israel rest from wars on every side and joshua was old and full of years
 joshua sent for all israel for their responsible men and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers and said to them i am old and full of years
 you have seen everything the lord your god has done to all these nations because of you for it is the lord your god who has been fighting for you
 now i have given to you as the heritage of your tribes all these nations which are still in the land together with those cut off by me from jordan as far as the great sea on the west
 the lord your god will send them away by force driving them out before you and you are to take their land for your heritage as the lord your god said to you
 so be very strong to keep and do whatever is recorded in the book of the law of moses not turning away from it to the right or to the left
 have nothing to do with these nations who still are living among you let not their gods be named by you or used in your oaths do not be their servants or give them worship
 but be true to the lord your god as you have been till this day
 for the lord has sent out from before you nations great and strong and they have all given way before you till this day
 one man of you is able to put to flight a thousand for it is the lord your god who is fighting for you as he has said to you
 so keep watch on yourselves and see that you have love for the lord your god
 for if you go back joining yourselves to the rest of these nations who are still among you getting married to them and living with them and they with you
 then you may be certain that the lord your god will not go on driving these nations out from before you but they will become a danger and a cause of sin to you a whip for your sides and thorns in your eyes till you are cut off from this good land which the lord your god has given you
 now i am about to go the way of all the earth and you have seen and are certain all of you in your hearts and souls that in all the good things which the lord said about you he has kept faith with you everything has come true for you
 and you will see that as all the good things which the lord your god undertook to do for you have come to you so the lord will send down on you all the evil things till he has made your destruction complete and you are cut off from the good land which the lord your god has given you
 if the agreement of the lord your god which was given to you by his orders is broken and you become the servants of other gods and give them worship then the wrath of the lord will be burning against you and you will quickly be cut off from the good land which he has given you
 then joshua got all the tribes of israel together at shechem and he sent for the responsible men of israel and their chiefs and their judges and their overseers and they took their place before god
 and joshua said to all the people these are the words of the lord the god of israel in the past your fathers terah the father of abraham and the father of nahor were living on the other side of the river and they were worshipping other gods
 and i took your father abraham from the other side of the river guiding him through all the land of canaan i made his offspring great in number and gave him isaac
 and to isaac i gave jacob and esau to esau i gave mount seir as his heritage but jacob and his children went down to egypt
 and i sent moses and aaron troubling egypt by all the signs i did among them and after that i took you out
 i took your fathers out of egypt and you came to the red sea and the egyptians came after your fathers to the red sea with their war carriages and their horsemen
 and at their cry the lord made it dark between you and the egyptians and made the sea go over them covering them with its waters your eyes have seen what i did in egypt then for a long time you were living in the waste land
 and i took you into the lands of the amorites on the other side of jordan and they made war on you and i gave them into your hands and you took their land and i sent destruction on them before you
 then balak the son of zippor king of moab went up to war against israel and he sent for balaam the son of beor to put a curse on you
 but i did not give ear to balaam and so he went on blessing you and i kept you safe from him
 then you went over jordan and came to jericho and the men of jericho made war on you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites and the hivites and the jebusites and i gave them up into your hands
 and i sent the hornet before you driving out the two kings of the amorites before you not with your sword and your bow
 and i gave you a land on which you had done no work and towns not of your building and you are now living in them and your food comes from vine gardens and olive gardens not of your planting
 so now go in fear of the lord and be his servants with true hearts put away the gods worshipped by your fathers across the river and in egypt and be servants of the lord
 and if it seems evil to you to be the servants of the lord make the decision this day whose servants you will be of the gods whose servants your fathers were across the river or of the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but i and my house will be the servants of the lord
 then the people in answer said never will we give up the lord to be the servants of other gods
 for it is the lord our god who has taken us and our fathers out of the land of egypt out of the prison house and who did all those great signs before our eyes and kept us safe on all our journeys and among all the peoples through whom we went
 and the lord sent out from before us all the peoples the amorites living in the land so we will be the servants of the lord for he is our god
 and joshua said to the people you are not able to be the servants of the lord for he is a holy god a god who will not let his honour be given to another he will have no mercy on your wrongdoing or your sins
 if you are turned away from the lord and become the servants of strange gods then turning against you he will do you evil cutting you off after he has done you good
 and the people said to joshua no  but we will be the servants of the lord
 and joshua said to the people you are witnesses against yourselves that you have made the decision to be the servants of the lord and they said we are witnesses
 then he said put away the strange gods among you turning your hearts to the lord the god of israel
 and the people said to joshua we will be the servants of the lord our god and we will give ear to his voice
 so joshua made an agreement with the people that day and gave them a rule and a law in shechem
 and joshua put these words on record writing them in the book of the law of god and he took a great stone and put it up there under the oak tree which was in the holy place of the lord
 and joshua said to all the people see now this stone is to be a witness against us for all the words of the lord have been said to us in its hearing so it will be a witness against you if you are false to the lord your god
 then joshua let the people go away every man to his heritage
 now after these things the death of joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord took place he being then a hundred and ten years old
 and they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in timnath serah in the hill country of ephraim to the north of mount gaash
 and israel was true to the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the older men who were still living after joshuas death and had seen what the lord had done for israel
 and the bones of joseph which the children of israel had taken up from egypt they put in the earth in shechem in the property which jacob had got from the sons of hamor the father of shechem for a hundred shekels and they became the heritage of the children of joseph
 then the death of eleazar the son of aaron took place and his body was put in the earth in the hill of phinehas his son which had been given to him in the hill country of ephraim
 then joshua got up early in the morning and moving on from shittim he and all the children of israel came to jordan and were there for the night before going over
 and at the end of three days the men in authority over the people went through the tents
 giving the people their orders and saying when you see the ark of the agreement of the lord your god lifted up by the priests the levites then get up from your places and go after it
 but let there be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits come no nearer to it so that you may see the way you have to go for you have not been over this way before
 and joshua said to the people make yourselves holy for tomorrow the lord will do works of wonder among you
 then joshua said to the priests take up the ark of the agreement and go over in front of the people so they took up the ark of the agreement and went in front of the people
 and the lord said to joshua from now on i will give you glory in the eyes of all israel so that they may see that as i was with moses so i will be with you
 and you are to give orders to the priests who take up the ark of the agreement and say when you come to the edge of the waters of jordan go no further
 and joshua said to the children of israel come to me here and give ear to the words of the lord your god
 and joshua said by this you will see that the living god is among you and that he will certainly send out from before you the canaanite and the hittite and the hivite and the perizzite and the girgashite and the amorite and the jebusite
 see the ark of the agreement of the lord of all the earth is going over before you into jordan
 so take twelve men out of the tribes of israel a man from every tribe
 and when the feet of the priests who take up the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth come to rest in the waters of jordan the waters of jordan will be cut off all the waters flowing down from higher up and will come together in a mass
 so when the people went out from their tents to go over jordan the priests who took up the ark of the agreement were in front of the people
 and when those who took up the ark came to jordan and the feet of the priests who took up the ark were touching the edge of the water  for the waters of jordan are overflowing all through the time of the grain cutting 
 then the waters flowing down from higher up were stopped and came together in a mass a long way back at adam a town near zarethan and the waters flowing down to the sea of the arabah the salt sea were cut off and the people went across opposite jericho
 and the priests who took up the ark of the agreement of the lord kept their places with their feet on dry land in the middle of jordan while all israel went over on dry land till all the nation had gone over jordan
 now when all the nation had come to the other side of jordan the lord said to joshua
 take twelve men from the people a man for every tribe
 and say to them take up from the middle of jordan from the place where the feet of the priests were resting twelve stones and take them over with you and put them down in the place where you take your rest tonight
 so joshua sent for the twelve men whom he had ready one man out of every tribe of the children of israel
 and he said to them go over before the ark of the lord your god into the middle of jordan and let every one of you take up a stone on his back one for every tribe of the children of israel
 so that this may be a sign among you when your children say to you in time to come what is the reason for these stones
 then you will say to them because the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the lords agreement when it went over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones will be a sign for the children of israel keeping it in their memory for ever
 so the children of israel did as joshua gave them orders and took twelve stones from the middle of jordan as the lord had said to joshua one for every tribe of the children of israel these they took across with them to their nights resting place and put them down there
 and joshua put up twelve stones in the middle of jordan where the feet of the priests who took up the ark of the agreement had been placed and there they are to this day
 for the priests who took up the ark kept there in the middle of jordan till all the orders given to joshua by moses from the lord had been done then the people went over quickly
 and when all the people had come to the other side the ark of the lord went over and the priests before the eyes of the people
 and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh went over armed before the children of israel as moses had said to them
 about forty thousand armed for war went over before the lord to the fight to the lowlands of jericho
 that day the lord made joshua great in the eyes of all israel and all the days of his life they went in fear of him as they had gone in fear of moses
 then the lord said to joshua
 give orders to the priests who take up the ark of witness to come up out of jordan
 so joshua gave orders to the priests saying come up now out of jordan
 and when the priests who took up the ark of the lords agreement came up out of jordan and their feet came out on to dry land the waters of jordan went back to their place overflowing its edges as before
 so on the tenth day of the first month the people came up out of jordan and put up their tents in gilgal on the east side of jericho
 and the twelve stones which they took out of jordan joshua put up in gilgal
 and he said to the children of israel when your children say to their fathers in time to come what is the reason for these stones
 then give your children the story and say israel came over this river jordan on dry land
 for the lord your god made the waters of jordan dry before you till you had gone across as he did to the red sea drying it up before us till we had gone across
 so that all the peoples of the earth may see that the hand of the lord is strong and that they may go in fear of the lord your god for ever
 now when the news came to all the kings of the amorites on the west side of jordan and all the kings of the canaanites living by the sea how the lord had made the waters of jordan dry before the children of israel till they had gone across their hearts became like water and there was no more spirit in them because of the children of israel
 at that time the lord said to joshua make yourself stone knives and give the children of israel circumcision a second time
 so joshua made stone knives and gave the children of israel circumcision at gibeath ha araloth
 and this is the reason why joshua did so all the males of the people who came out of egypt all the fighting men had been overtaken by death in the waste land on the way after they came out of egypt
 all the people who came out had undergone circumcision but all the people whose birth had taken place in the waste land on their journey from egypt had not
 for the children of israel were wandering in the waste land for forty years till all the nation that is all the fighting men who had come out of egypt were dead because they did not give ear to the voice of the lord to whom the lord said with an oath that he would not let them see the land which the lord had given his word to their fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey
 and their children who came up in their place now underwent circumcision by the hands of joshua not having had it before for there had been no circumcision on the journey
 so when all the nation had undergone circumcision they kept in their tents till they were well again
 and the lord said to joshua today the shame of egypt has been rolled away from you so that place was named gilgal to this day
 so the children of israel put up their tents in gilgal and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening in the lowlands of jericho
 and on the day after the passover they had for their food the produce of the land unleavened cakes and dry grain on the same day
 and there was no more manna from the day after they had for their food the produce of the land the children of israel had manna no longer but that year the produce of the land of canaan was their food
 now when joshua was near jericho lifting up his eyes he saw a man in front of him with his sword uncovered in his hand and joshua went up to him and said are you for us or against us
 and he said no but i have come as captain of the armies of the lord then joshua falling down with his face to the earth in worship said what has my lord to say to his servant
 and the captain of the lords army said to joshua take off your shoes from your feet for the place where you are is holy and joshua did so
  now jericho was all shut up because of the children of israel there was no going out or coming in 
 and the lord said to joshua see i have given into your hands jericho with its king and all its men of war
 now let all your fighting men make a circle round the town going all round it once do this for six days
 and let seven priests go before the ark with seven loud sounding horns in their hands on the seventh day you are to go round the town seven times the priests blowing their horns
 and at the sound of a long note on the horns let all the people give a loud cry and the wall of the town will come down flat and all the people are to go straight forward
 then joshua the son of nun sent for the priests and said to them take up the ark of the agreement and let seven priests take seven horns in their hands and go before the ark of the lord
 and he said to the people go forward circling the town and let the armed men go before the ark of the lord
 so after joshua had said this to the people the seven priests with their seven horns went forward before the lord blowing on their horns and the ark of the lords agreement went after them
 and the armed men went before the priests who were blowing the horns and the mass of the people went after the ark blowing their horns
 and to the people joshua gave an order saying you will give no cry and make no sound and let no word go out of your mouth till the day when i say give a loud cry then give a loud cry
 so he made the ark of the lord go all round the town once then they went back to the tents for the night
 and early in the morning joshua got up and the priests took up the ark of the lord
 and the seven priests with their seven horns went on before the ark of the lord blowing their horns the armed men went before them and the mass of the people went after the ark of the lord blowing their horns
 the second day they went all round the town once and then went back to their tents and so they did for six days
 then on the seventh day they got up early at the dawn of the day and went round the town in the same way but that day they went round it seven times
 and the seventh time at the sound of the priests horns joshua said to the people now give a loud cry for the lord has given you the town
 and the town will be put to the curse and everything in it will be given to the lord only rahab the loose woman and all who are in the house with her will be kept safe because she kept secret the men we sent
 and as for you keep yourselves from the cursed thing for fear that you may get a desire for it and take some of it for yourselves and so be the cause of a curse and great trouble on the tents of israel
 but all the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron are holy to the lord they are to come into the store house of the lord
 so the people gave a loud cry and the horns were sounded and on hearing the horns the people gave a loud cry and the wall came down flat so that the people went up into the town every man going straight before him and they took the town
 and they put everything in the town to the curse men and women young and old ox and sheep and ass they put to death without mercy
 then joshua said to the two men who had been sent to make a search through the land go into the house of the loose woman and get her out and all who are with her as you gave her your oath
 so the searchers went in and got out rahab and her father and mother and her brothers and all she had and they got out all her family and they took them outside the tents of israel
 then after burning up the town and everything in it they put the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron into the store house of the lords house
 but joshua kept rahab the loose woman and her fathers family and all she had from death and so she got a living place among the children of israel to this day because she kept safe the men whom joshua had sent to make a search through the land
 then joshua gave the people orders with an oath saying let that man be cursed before the lord who puts his hand to the building up of this town with the loss of his first son will he put the first stone of it in place and with the loss of his youngest son he will put up its doors
 so the lord was with joshua and news of him went through all the land
 but the children of israel did wrong about the cursed thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the family of judah took of the cursed thing moving the lord to wrath against the children of israel
 now joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is by the side of beth aven on the east side of beth el and said to them go up and make a search through the land and the men went up and saw how ai was placed
 then they came back to joshua and said to him do not send all the people up but let about two or three thousand men go up and make an attack on ai there is no need for all the people to be tired with the journey there for it is only a small town
 so about three thousand of the people went up and were sent in flight by the men of ai
 the men of ai put to death about thirty six of them driving them from before the town as far as the stoneworks and overcoming them on the way down and the hearts of the people became like water
 then joshua in great grief went down on the earth before the ark of the lord till the evening and all the chiefs of israel with him and they put dust on their heads
 and joshua said o lord god why have you taken us over jordan only to give us up into the hands of the amorites for our destruction if only it had been enough for us to keep on the other side of jordan 
 o lord what am i to say now that israel have given way before their attackers
 for when the news comes to the canaanites and all the people of the land they will come up shutting us in and cutting off our name from the earth and what will you do for the honour of your great name
 then the lord said to joshua get up what are you doing with your face to the earth
 israel has done wrong sinning against the agreement which i made with them they have even taken of the cursed thing acting falsely like thieves they have put it among their goods
 for this reason the children of israel have given way turning their backs in flight before their attackers because they are cursed i will no longer be with you if you do not put the cursed thing away from among you
 up  make the people holy say to them make yourselves holy before tomorrow for the lord the god of israel has said there is a cursed thing among you o israel and you will give way before your attackers in the fight till the cursed thing has been taken away from among you
 so in the morning you are to come near tribe by tribe and the tribe marked out by the lord is to come near family by family and the family marked out by the lord is to come near house by house and the house marked out by the lord is to come near man by man
 then the man who is taken with the cursed thing is to be burned with everything which is his because he has gone against the agreement of the lord and has done an act of shame in israel
 so joshua got up early in the morning and made israel come before him by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken
 then he made judah come forward and the family of the zerahites was taken and he made the family of the zerahites come forward man by man and zabdi was taken
 then the house of zabdi came forward man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken
 and joshua said to achan my son give glory and praise to the lord the god of israel give me word now of what you have done and keep nothing back from me
 and achan answering said to joshua truly i have done wrong against the lord the god of israel and this is what i have done
 when i saw among their goods a fair robe of babylon and two hundred shekels of silver and a mass of gold fifty shekels in weight i was overcome by desire and took them and they are put away in the earth in my tent and the silver is under it
 so joshua sent men quickly and looking in his tent they saw where the robe had been put away secretly with the silver under it
 and they took them from the tent and came back with them to joshua and the children of israel and put them before the lord
 then joshua and all israel took achan the son of zerah and the silver and the robe and the mass of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and everything he had and they took them up into the valley of achor
 and joshua said why have you been a cause of trouble to us today the lord will send trouble on you and all israel took part in stoning him they had him stoned to death and then burned with fire
 and over him they put a great mass of stones which is there to this day then the heat of the lords wrath was turned away so that place was named the valley of achor to this day
 then the lord said to joshua have no fear and do not be troubled take with you all the fighting men and go up against ai for i have given into your hands the king of ai and his people and his town and his land
 and you are to do to ai and its king as you did to jericho and its king but their goods and their cattle you may take for yourselves let a secret force be stationed to make a surprise attack on the town from the back
 so joshua and the fighting men got ready to go up against ai and joshua took thirty thousand men of war and sent them out by night
 and he gave them their orders saying go and take up your position secretly at the back of the town do not go very far away and let all of you be ready
 and i and all the people with me will come near the town and when they come out against us as they did before we will go in flight from them
 and they will come out after us till we have got them away from the town for they will say they have gone in flight from us as before so we will go in flight before them
 then you will get up from your secret position and take the town for the lord your god will give it up into your hands
 and when you have taken the town put fire to it as the lord has said see i have given you your orders
 so joshua sent them out and they took up a secret position between beth el and ai on the west side of ai but joshua kept with the people that night
 and early in the morning joshua got up and put the people in order and he and the chiefs of israel went up before the people to ai
 and all the fighting men who were with him went up and came near the town and took up a position on the north side of ai facing the town with a valley between him and the town
 and taking about five thousand men he put them in position for a surprise attack on the west side of ai between beth el and ai
 so all the people were in their places the army on the north side of the town and the secret force on the west and that night joshua went down into the valley
 now when the king of ai saw it he got up quickly and went out to war against israel he and all his people to the slope going down to the valley but he had no idea that a secret force was waiting at the back of the town
 then joshua and all israel acting as if they were overcome before them went in flight by way of the waste land
 and all the people in ai came together to go after them and they went after joshua moving away from the town
 there was not a man in ai and beth el who did not go out after israel and the town was open and unwatched while they went after israel
 and the lord said to joshua let your spear be stretched out against ai for i will give it into your hands so joshua took up his spear stretching it out in the direction of the town
 then the secret force came quickly from their place and running forward when they saw his hand stretched out went into the town and took it and put fire to it straight away
 then the men of ai looking back saw the smoke of the town going up to heaven and were unable to go this way or that and the people who had gone in flight to the waste land were turned back on those who were coming after them
 and when joshua and all israel saw that the town had been taken by the surprise attack and that the smoke of the town had gone up turning round they overcame the men of ai
 then the other force came out of the town against them so that they were being attacked on this side and on that and israel overcame them and let not one of them get away with his life
 but the king of ai they made prisoner and took him to joshua
 then after the destruction of all the people of ai in the field and in the waste land where they went after them and when all the people had been put to death without mercy all israel went back to ai and put to death all who were in it without mercy
 on that day twelve thousand were put to death men and women all the people of ai
 for joshua did not take back his hand with the outstretched spear till the destruction of the people of ai was complete
 but the cattle and the goods from that town israel took for themselves as the lord had given orders to joshua
 so joshua gave ai to the flames and made it a waste mass of stones for ever as it is to this day
 and he put the king of ai to death hanging him on a tree till evening and when the sun went down joshua gave them orders to take his body down from the tree and put it in the public place of the town covering it with a great mass of stones which is there to this day
 then joshua put up an altar to the lord the god of israel in mount ebal
 in the way ordered by moses the servant of the lord as it is recorded in the book of the law of moses an altar of uncut stones untouched by any iron instrument and on it they made burned offerings and peace offerings to the lord
 and he made there on the stones a copy of the law of moses writing it before the eyes of the children of israel
 and all israel those who were israelites by birth as well as the men from other lands living with them and their responsible men and their overseers and judges took their places round the ark in front of the priests the levites whose work it was to take up the ark of the lords agreement half of them were stationed in front of mount gerizim and half in front of mount ebal in agreement with the orders for the blessing of the children of israel which moses the servant of the lord had given
 and after he gave them all the words of the law the blessing and the curse as it is all recorded in the book of the law
 reading to all the meeting of israel with the women and the children and the men from other lands who were living among them every word of the orders which moses had given
 now on hearing the news of these things all the kings on the west side of jordan in the hill country and the lowlands and by the great sea in front of lebanon the hittites and the amorites the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites
 came together with one purpose to make war against joshua and israel
 and the men of gibeon hearing what joshua had done to jericho and ai
 acting with deceit got food together as if for a long journey and took old food bags for their asses and old and cracked wine skins kept together with cord
 and put old stitched up shoes on their feet and old clothing on their backs and all the food they had with them was dry and broken up
 and they came to joshua to the tent circle at gilgal and said to him and to the men of israel we have come from a far country so now make an agreement with us
 and the men of israel said to the hivites it may be that you are living among us how then may we make an agreement with you
 and they said to joshua we are your servants then joshua said to them who are you and where do you come from
 and they said to him your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of the lord your god for the story of his great name and of all he did in egypt has come to our ears
 and what he did to the two kings of the amorites east of jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan at ashtaroth
 so the responsible men and all the people of our country said to us take food with you for the journey and go to them and say to them we are your servants so now make an agreement with us
 this bread which we have with us for our food we took warm and new from our houses when starting on our journey to you but now see it has become dry and broken up
 and these wine skins were new when we put the wine in them and now they are cracked as you see and our clothing and our shoes have become old because of our very long journey here
 and the men took some of their food without requesting directions from the lord
 so joshua made peace with them and made an agreement with them that they were not to be put to death and the chiefs of the people took an oath to them
 now three days after when they had made this agreement with them they had word that these men were their neighbours living near them
 and the children of israel went forward on their journey and on the third day came to their towns now their towns were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kiriath jearim
 and the children of israel did not put them to death because the chiefs of the people had taken an oath to them by the lord the god of israel and all the people made an outcry against the chiefs
 but all the chiefs said to the people we have taken an oath to them by the lord the god of israel and so we may not put our hands on them
 this is what we will do to them we will not put them to death for fear that wrath may come on us because of our oath to them
 keep them living and let them be servants cutting wood and getting water for all the people and all the people did as the chiefs had said to them
 then joshua sent for them and said to them why have you been false to us saying we are very far from you when you are living among us
 now because of this you are cursed and you will for ever be our servants cutting wood and getting water for the house of my god
 and answering joshua they said because it came to the ears of your servants that the lord your god had given orders to his servant moses to give you all this land and to send destruction on all the people living in it because of you so fearing greatly for our lives because of you we have done this
 and now we are in your hands do to us whatever seems good and right to you
 so he kept them safe from the children of israel and did not let them be put to death
 and that day joshua made them servants cutting wood and getting water for the people and for the altar of the lord in the place marked out by him to this day
 now after the death of joshua the children of israel made request to the lord saying who is to go up first to make war for us against the canaanites
 and the lord said judah is to go up see i have given the land into his hands
 then judah said to simeon his brother come up with me into my heritage so that we may make war against the canaanites and i will then go with you into your heritage so simeon went with him
 and judah went up and the lord gave the canaanites and the perizzites into their hands and they overcame ten thousand of them in bezek
 and they came across adoni zedek and made war on him and they overcame the canaanites and the perizzites
 but adoni zedek went in flight and they went after him and overtook him and had his thumbs and his great toes cut off
 and adoni zedek said seventy kings whose thumbs and great toes had been cut off got broken meat under my table as i have done so has god done to me in full and they took him to jerusalem and he came to his end there
 then the children of judah made an attack on jerusalem and took it burning down the town after they had put its people to the sword without mercy
 after that the children of judah went down to make war on the canaanites living in the hill country and in the south and in the lowlands
 and caleb went against the canaanites of hebron  now in earlier times hebron was named kiriath arba  and he put sheshai and ahiman and talmai to the sword
 and from there he went up against the people of debir  now the name of debir in earlier times was kiriath sepher 
 and caleb said i will give achsah my daughter as wife to the man who overcomes kiriath sepher and takes it
 and othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother took it so he gave him his daughter achsah for his wife
 now when she came to him he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father and she got down from her ass and caleb said to her what is it
 and she said to him give me a blessing because you have put me in a dry south land now give me springs of water so caleb gave her the higher spring and the lower spring
 now hobab the kenite moses father in law had come up out of the town of palm trees with the children of judah into the waste land of arad and he went and was living among the amalekites
 and judah went with simeon his brother and overcame the canaanites living in zephath and put it under the curse and he gave the town the name of hormah
 then judah took gaza and its limit and ashkelon and its limit and ekron and its limit
 and the lord was with judah and he took the hill country for his heritage but he was unable to make the people of the valley go out for they had war carriages of iron
 and they gave hebron to caleb as moses had said and he took the land of the three sons of anak driving them out from there
 and the children of judah did not make the jebusites who were living in jerusalem go out the jebusites are still living with the children of benjamin in jerusalem
 and the family of joseph went up against beth el and the lord was with them
 so they sent men to make a search round beth el  now the name of the town in earlier times was luz 
 and the watchers saw a man coming out of the town and said to him if you will make clear to us the way into the town we will be kind to you
 so he made clear to them the way into the town and they put it to the sword but they let the man and all his family get away safe
 and he went into the land of the hittites building a town there and naming it luz which is its name to this day
 and manasseh did not take away the land of the people of beth shean and its daughter towns or of taanach and its daughter towns or of the people of dor and its daughter towns or of the people of ibleam and its daughter towns or of the people of megiddo and its daughter towns driving them out but the canaanites would go on living in that land
 and whenever israel became strong they put the canaanites to forced work without driving them out completely
 and ephraim did not make the canaanites who were living in gezer go out but the canaanites went on living in gezer among them
 zebulun did not make the people of kitron or the people of nahalol go out but the canaanites went on living among them and were put to forced work
 and asher did not take the land of the people of acco or zidon or ahlab or achzib or helbah or aphik or rehob driving them out
 but the asherites went on living among the canaanites the people of the land without driving them out
 naphtali did not take the land of the people of beth shemesh or of beth anath driving them out but he was living among the canaanites in the land however the people of beth shemesh and beth anath were put to forced work
 and the children of dan were forced into the hill country by the amorites who would not let them come down into the valley
 for the amorites would go on living in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim but the children of joseph became stronger than they and put them to forced work
 and the limit of the edomites went from the slope of akrabbim from sela and up
 now after abimelech tola the son of puah the son of dodo a man of issachar became the saviour of israel he was living in shamir in the hill country of ephraim
 he was judge over israel for twenty three years and at his death his body was put to rest in the earth in shamir
 and after him came jair the gileadite who was judge over israel for twenty two years
 and he had thirty sons who went on thirty young asses and they had thirty towns in the land of gilead which are named havvoth jair to this day
 and at the death of jair his body was put to rest in the earth in kamon
 and again the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord worshipping the baals and astartes and the gods of aram and the gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of ammon and the gods of the philistines they gave up the lord and were servants to him no longer
 and the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the children of ammon
 and that year the children of israel were crushed under their yoke for eighteen years all the children of israel on the other side of jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead were cruelly crushed down
 and the children of ammon went over jordan to make war against judah and benjamin and the house of ephraim and israel was in great trouble
 then the children of israel crying out to the lord said great is our sin against you for we have given up our god and have been servants to the baals
 and the lord said to the children of israel were not the egyptians and the amorites and the children of ammon and the philistines
 and the zidonians and amalek and midian crushing you down and in answer to your cry did i not give you salvation from their hands
 but for all this you have given me up and have been servants to other gods so i will be your saviour no longer
 go send up your cry for help to the gods of your selection let them be your saviours in the time of your trouble
 and the children of israel said to the lord we are sinners do to us whatever seems good to you only give us salvation this day
 so they put away the strange gods from among them and became the lords servants and his soul was angry because of the sorrows of israel
 then the children of ammon came together and put their army in position in gilead and the children of israel came together and put their army in position in mizpah
 and the people of israel said to one another who will be the first to make an attack on the children of ammon we will make him head over all gilead
 now jephthah the gileadite was a great man of war he was the son of a loose woman and gilead was his father
 and gileads wife gave birth to sons and when her sons became men they sent jephthah away saying you have no part in the heritage of our fathers house for you are the son of another woman
 so jephthah went in flight from his brothers and was living in the land of tob where a number of good for nothing men joining jephthah went out with him on his undertakings
 now after a time the children of ammon made war against israel
 and when the children of ammon made war against israel the responsible men of gilead went to get jephthah back from the land of tob
 and they said to jephthah come and be our chief so that we may make war against the children of ammon
 but jephthah said to the responsible men of gilead did you not in your hate for me send me away from my fathers house why do you come to me now when you are in trouble
 and the responsible men of gilead said to jephthah that is the reason we have come back to you so go with us and make war against the children of ammon and we will make you our head over all the people of gilead
 then jephthah said to the responsible men of gilead if you take me back to make war against the children of ammon and if with the help of the lord i overcome them will you make me your head
 and the responsible men of gilead said to jephthah may the lord be our witness we will certainly do as you say
 so jephthah went with the responsible men of gilead and the people made him head and chief over them and jephthah said all these things before the lord in mizpah
 then jephthah sent men to the king of the children of ammon saying what have you against me that you have come to make war against my land
 and the king of the children of ammon said to the men sent by jephthah because israel when he came up out of egypt took away my land from the arnon as far as the jabbok and as far as jordan so now give me back those lands quietly
 and jephthah sent again to the king of the children of ammon
 and said to him this is the word of jephthah israel did not take away the land of moab or the land of the children of ammon
 but when they came up from egypt israel went through the waste land to the red sea and came to kadesh
 then israel sent men to the king of edom saying let me now go through your land but the king of edom did not give ear to them and in the same way he sent to the king of moab but he would not so israel went on living in kadesh
 then he went on through the waste land and round the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and put up their tents on the other side of the arnon they did not come inside the limit of moab for the arnon was the limit of moab
 and israel sent men to sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said to him let me now go through your land to my place
 but sihon would not give way and let israel go through his land and sihon got together all his people and put his army in position in jahaz and made war on israel
 and the lord the god of israel gave sihon and all his people into the hands of israel and they overcame them so all the land of the amorites the people of that land became israels
 all the limit of the amorites was theirs from the arnon as far as the jabbok and from the waste land even to jordan
 so now the lord the god of israel has taken away their land from the amorites and given it to his people israel are you then to have it
 do you not keep the lands of those whom chemosh your god sends out from before you so we will keep all the lands of those whom the lord our god sends out from before us
 what  are you any better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever take up a cause against israel or make war against them
 while israel was living in heshbon and its daughter towns and in aroer and its daughter towns and in all the towns which are by the side of the arnon for three hundred years why did you not get them back at that time
 so i have done no wrong against you but you are doing wrong to me in fighting against me may the lord who is judge this day be judge between the children of israel and the children of ammon
 the king of the children of ammon however did not give ear to the words which jephthah sent to him
 then the spirit of the lord came on jephthah and he went through gilead and manasseh and came to mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he went over to the children of ammon
 and jephthah took an oath to the lord and said if you will give the children of ammon into my hands
 then whoever comes out from the door of my house meeting me when i come back in peace from the children of ammon will be the lords and i will give him as a burned offering
 so jephthah went over to the children of ammon to make war on them and the lord gave them into his hands
 and he made an attack on them from aroer all the way to minnith overrunning twenty towns as far as abel cheramim and put great numbers to the sword so the children of ammon were crushed before the children of israel
 then jephthah came back to his house in mizpah and his daughter came out meeting him on his way with music and with dances she was his only child he had no other sons or daughters
 and when he saw her he was overcome with grief and said ah  my daughter  i am crushed with sorrow and it is you who are the chief cause of my trouble for i have made an oath to the lord and i may not take it back
 and she said to him my father you have made an oath to the lord do then to me whatever you have said for the lord has sent a full reward on your haters on the children of ammon
 then she said to her father only do this for me let me have two months to go away into the mountains with my friends weeping for my sad fate
 and he said go then so he sent her away for two months and she went with her friends to the mountains weeping for her sad fate
 and at the end of two months she went back to her father who did with her as he had said in his oath and she had never been touched by a man so it became a rule in israel
 for the women to go year by year sorrowing for the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in every year
 now the men of ephraim came together and took up arms and went over to zaphon and they said to jephthah why did you go over to make war against the children of ammon without sending for us to go with you now we will put your house on fire over you
 and jephthah said to them i and my people were in danger and the children of ammon were very cruel to us and when i sent for you you gave me no help against them
 so when i saw that there was no help to be had from you i put my life in my hand and went over against the children of ammon and the lord gave them into my hands why then have you come up to me this day to make war on me
 then jephthah got together all the men of gilead and made war on ephraim and the men of gilead overcame ephraim
 and the gileadites took the crossing places of jordan against the ephraimites and when any of the men of ephraim who had gone in flight said let me go over the men of gilead said to him are you an ephraimite and if he said no
 then they said to him now say shibboleth and he said sibboleth and was not able to say it in the right way then they took him and put him to death at the crossing places of jordan and at that time forty two thousand ephraimites were put to death
 now jephthah was judge of israel for six years and jephthah the gileadite came to his death and his body was put to rest in his town mizpeh of gilead
 and after him ibzan of beth lehem was judge of israel
 he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent to other places and he got thirty wives from other places for his sons and he was judge of israel for seven years
 and ibzan came to his death and his body was put to rest at beth lehem
 and after him elon the zebulonite was judge of israel and he was judge of israel for ten years
 and elon the zebulonite came to his death and his body was put to rest in aijalon in the land of zebulun
 and after him abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite was judge of israel
 he had forty sons and thirty sons sons who went on seventy young asses and he was judge of israel for eight years
 and abdon the son of hillel came to his death and his body was put to rest in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the hill country of the amalekites
 and the children of israel again did evil in the eyes of the lord and the lord gave them into the hands of the philistines for forty years
 now there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites and his name was manoah and his wife had never given birth to a child
 and the angel of the lord came to the woman and said to her see now  though you have never given birth to children you will be with child and give birth to a son
 now then take care to have no wine or strong drink and to take no unclean thing for food
 for you are with child and will give birth to a son his hair is never to be cut for the child is to be separate to god from his birth and he will take up the work of freeing israel from the hands of the philistines
 then the woman came in and said to her husband a man came to me and his form was like the form of a god causing great fear i put no question to him about where he came from and he did not give me his name
 but he said to me you are with child and will give birth to a son and now do not take any wine or strong drink or let anything unclean be your food for the child will be separate to god from his birth to the day of his death
 then manoah made prayer to the lord and said o lord let the man of god whom you sent come to us again and make clear to us what we are to do for the child who is to come
 and god gave ear to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came to the woman again when she was seated in the field but her husband manoah was not with her
 so the woman running quickly gave her husband the news saying i have seen the man who came to me the other day
 and manoah got up and went after his wife and came up to the man and said to him are you the man who was talking to this woman and he said i am
 and manoah said now when your words come true what is to be the rule for the child and what will be his work
 and the angel of the lord said to manoah let the woman take note of what i have said to her
 she is to have nothing which comes from the vine for her food and let her take no wine or strong drink or anything which is unclean let her take care to do all i have given her orders to do
 and manoah said to the angel of the lord now let us keep you while we make ready a young goat for you
 and the angel of the lord said to manoah though you keep me i will not take of your food but if you will make a burned offering let it be offered to the lord for it had not come into manoahs mind that he was the angel of the lord
 then manoah said to the angel of the lord what is your name so that when your words come true we may give you honour
 but the angel of the lord said to him why are you questioning me about my name seeing that it is a wonder
 so manoah took the young goat with its meal offering offering it on the rock to the lord who did strange things
 and when the flame went up to heaven from the altar the angel of the lord went up in the flame of the altar while manoah and his wife were looking on and they went down on their faces to the earth
 but the angel of the lord was seen no more by manoah and his wife then it was clear to manoah that he was the angel of the lord
 and manoah said to his wife death will certainly be our fate for it is a god whom we have seen
 but his wife said to him if the lord was purposing our death he would not have taken our burned offering and our meal offering or have given us such orders about the child
 so the woman gave birth to a son and gave him the name samson and he became a man and the blessing of the lord was on him
 and the spirit of the lord first came on him in mahaneh dan between zorah and eshtaol
 now samson went down to timnah and saw a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines
 and when he came back he said to his father and mother i have seen a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines get her now for me for my wife
 then his father and mother said to him is there no woman among the daughters of your relations or among all my people that you have to go for your wife to the philistines who are without circumcision but samson said to his father get her for me for she is pleasing to me
 now his father and mother had no knowledge that this was the purpose of the lord who had the destruction of the philistines in mind now the philistines at that time were ruling over israel
 then samson went down to timnah  and his father and his mother  and came to the vine gardens of timnah and a young lion came rushing out at him
 and the spirit of the lord came on him with power and unarmed as he was pulling the lion in two as one might do to a young goat he put him to death  but he said nothing to his father and mother of what he had done 
 so he went down and had talk with the woman and she was pleasing to samson
 then after a time he went back to take her and turning from the road to see the dead body of the lion he saw a mass of bees in the body of the lion and honey there
 and he took the honey in his hand and went on tasting it on the way and when he came to his father and mother he gave some to them but did not say that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion
 then samson went down to the woman and made a feast there as was the way among young men
 and he took thirty friends and they were with him
 and samson said now i have a hard question for you if you are able to give me the answer before the seven days of the feast are over i will give you thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing
 but if you are not able to give me the answer then you will have to give me thirty linen robes and thirty changes of clothing and they said to him put your hard question and let us see what it is
 and he said out of the taker of food came food and out of the strong came the sweet and at the end of three days they were still not able to give the answer
 so on the fourth day they said to samsons wife get from your husband the answer to his question by some trick or other or we will have you and your fathers house burned with fire did you get us here to take all we have
 then samsons wife weeping over him said truly you have no love for me but only hate you have put a hard question to the children of my people and have not given me the answer and he said to her see i have not given the answer even to my father or my mother am i to give it to you
 and all the seven days of the feast she went on weeping over him and on the seventh day he gave her the answer because she gave him no peace and she sent word of it to the children of her people
 then on the seventh day before he went into the brides room the men of the town said to him what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said to them if you had not been ploughing with my cow you would not have got the answer to my question
 and the spirit of the lord came rushing on him and he went down to ashkelon and attacking thirty men there took their clothing from them and gave it to the men who had given the answer to his hard question then full of wrath he went back to his fathers house
 but samsons wife was given to the friend who had been his best man
 now a short time after at the time of the grain cutting samson taking with him a young goat went to see his wife and he said i will go in to my wife into the brides room but her father would not let him go in
 and her father said it seemed to me that you had only hate for her so i gave her to your friend but is not her younger sister fairer than she so please take her in place of the other
 then samson said to them this time i will give payment in full to the philistines for i am going to do them great evil
 so samson went and got three hundred foxes and some sticks of fire wood and he put the foxes tail to tail with a stick between every two tails
 then firing the sticks he let the foxes loose among the uncut grain of the philistines and all the corded stems as well as the living grain and the vine gardens and the olives went up in flames
 then the philistines said who has done this and they said samson the son in law of the timnite because he took his wife and gave her to his friend so the philistines came up and had her and her fathers house burned
 and samson said to them if you go on like this truly i will take my full payment from you and that will be the end of it
 and he made an attack on them driving them in uncontrolled flight and causing great destruction then he went away to his safe place in the crack of the rock at etam
 then the philistines went and put up their tents in judah all round lehi
 and the men of judah said why have you come up against us and they said we have come up to take samson and to do to him as he has done to us
 then three thousand of the men of judah went down to the crack of the rock of etam and said to samson is it not clear to you that the philistines are our rulers what is this you have done to us and he said to them i only did to them as they did to me
 then they said to him we have come down to take you and give you up into the hands of the philistines and samson said to them give me your oath that you will not make an attack on me yourselves
 and they said no we will take you and give you up into their hands but truly we will not put you to death so knotting two new cords round him they took him up from the rock
 and when he came to lehi the philistines came out meeting him with loud cries then the spirit of the lord came rushing on him and the cords on his arms became like grass which has been burned with fire and the bands came falling off his hands
 and taking up the mouth bone of an ass newly dead which he saw by chance on the earth he put to death a thousand men with it
 and samson said with a red asss mouth bone i have made them red with blood with a red asss mouth bone i have sent destruction on a thousand men
 and having said these words he let the mouth bone go out of his hand so that place was named ramath lehi
 after this he was in great need of water and crying out to the lord he said you have given this great salvation by the hand of your servant and now need of water will be my death and i will be given into the hands of this people who are without circumcision
 then god made a crack in the hollow rock in lehi and water came out of it and after drinking his spirit came back to him and he was strong again so that place was named en hakkore it is in lehi to this day
 and he was judge of israel in the days of the philistines for twenty years
 now samson went to gaza and there he saw a loose woman and went in to her
 and it was said to the gazites samson is here so they went round watching for him all day at the doorway of the town but at night they kept quiet saying when daylight comes we will put him to death
 and samson was there till the middle of the night then he got up and took a grip on the doors of the town pulling them up together with their two supports and their locks and put them on his back and took them up to the top of the hill in front of hebron
 now after this he was in love with a woman in the valley of sorek named delilah
 and the chiefs of the philistines came up to her and said to her make use of your power over him and see what is the secret of his great strength and how we may get the better of him and put bands on him so that we may make him feeble and every one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver
 so delilah said to samson make clear to me now what is the secret of your great strength and how you may be put in bands and made feeble
 and samson said to her if seven new bow cords which have never been made dry are knotted round me i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 so the chiefs of the philistines gave her seven new bow cords which had never been made dry and she had them tightly knotted round him
 now she had men waiting secretly in the inner room and she said to him the philistines are on you samson and the cords were broken by him as a twist of thread is broken when touched by a flame so the secret of his strength did not come to light
 then delilah said to samson see you have been making sport of me with false words now say truly how may you be put in bands
 and he said to her if they only put round me new thick cords which have never been used then i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 so delilah took new thick cords knotting them tightly round him and said to him the philistines are on you samson and men were waiting secretly in the inner room and the cords were broken off his arms like threads
 then delilah said to samson up to now you have made sport of me with false words now say truly how may you be put in bands and he said to her if you get the seven twists of my hair worked into the cloth you are making and fixed with the pin i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 so while he was sleeping she got the seven twists of his hair worked into her cloth and fixed with the pin and said to him the philistines are on you samson then awaking from his sleep he got up quickly pulling up cloth and machine together
 and she said to him why do you say you are my lover when your heart is not mine three times you have made sport of me and have not made clear to me the secret of your great strength
 so day after day she gave him no peace for ever questioning him till his soul was troubled to death
 and opening all his heart to her he said to her my head has never been touched by a blade for i have been separate to god from the day of my birth if my hair is cut off then my strength will go from me and i will become feeble and will be like any other man
 and when delilah saw that he had let her see into his heart she sent word to the chiefs of the philistines saying come up this time for he has let out all his heart to me then the chiefs of the philistines came to her with the money in their hands
 and she made him go to sleep on her knees and she sent for a man and had his seven twists of hair cut off and while it was being done he became feeble and his strength went from him
 then she said the philistines are on you samson and awaking from his sleep he said i will go out as at other times shaking myself free but he was not conscious that the lord had gone from him
 so the philistines took him and put out his eyes then they took him down to gaza and chaining him with bands of brass put him to work crushing grain in the prison house
 but the growth of his hair was starting again after it had been cut off
 and the chiefs of the philistines came together to make a great offering to dagon their god and to be glad for they said our god has given into our hands samson our hater
 and when the people saw him they gave praise to their god for they said our god has given into our hands the one who was fighting against us who made our country waste and who put great numbers of us to death
 now when their hearts were full of joy they said send for samson to make sport for us and they sent for samson out of the prison house and he made sport before them and they put him between the pillars
 and samson said to the boy who took him by the hand let me put my hand on the pillars supporting the house so that i may put my back against them
 now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and about three thousand men and women were on the roof looking on while samson made sport
 and samson crying out to the lord said o lord god do have me now in mind and do make me strong only this once o god so that i may take one last payment from the philistines for my two eyes
 then samson put his arms round the two middle pillars supporting the house putting his weight on them on one with his right hand and on the other with his left
 and samson said let death overtake me with the philistines and he put out all his strength and the house came down on the chiefs and on all the people who were in it so the dead whom he sent to destruction by his death were more than all those on whom he had sent destruction in his life
 then his brothers and his fathers people came down and took him up and put his body to rest in the earth between zorah and eshtaol in the resting place of manoah his father and he had been judge of israel for twenty years
 now there was a man of the hill country of ephraim named micah
 and he said to his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver which were taken from you about which you took an oath and said in my hearing i have given this silver to the lord from my hand for myself to make a pictured image and a metal image see i have the silver for i took it so now i will give it back to you and his mother said may the blessing of the lord be on my son
 and he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother and his mother said i have made the silver holy to the lord from me for my son to make a pictured image and a metal image
 so he gave the silver back to his mother then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a metal worker who made a pictured image and a metal image from them and it was in the house of micah
 and the man micah had a house of gods and he made an ephod and family gods and put one of his sons in the position of priest
 in those days there was no king in israel every man did as seemed right to him
 now there was a young man living in beth lehem judah of the family of judah and a levite who was not a townsman of the place
 and he went away from the town of beth lehem judah looking for somewhere to make his living place and on his journey he came to the hill country of ephraim to the house of micah
 and micah said to him where do you come from and he said to him i am a levite from beth lehem judah and i am looking for a living place
 then micah said to him make your living place with me and be a father and a priest to me and i will give you ten shekels of silver a year and your clothing and food
 and the levite said he would make his living place with the man and he became to him as one of his sons
 and micah gave the position to the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah
 then micah said now i am certain that the lord will do me good seeing that the levite has become my priest
 in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the danites were looking for a heritage for themselves to be their living place for up to that time no distribution of land had been made to them among the tribes of israel
 so the children of dan sent five men from among their number strong men from zorah and from eshtaol to take a look at the land and make a search through it and they said to them go and make a search through the land and they came to the hill country of ephraim to the house of micah where they made a stop for the night
 when they were near the house of micah hearing a voice which was not strange to them that of the young levite they went out of their road to his place and said to him how did you come here and what are you doing in this place and why are you here
 and he said to them this is what micah did for me and he gave me payment and i became his priest
 then they said do get directions from god for us to see if the journey on which we are going will have a good outcome
 and the priest said to them go in peace your way is guided by the lord
 then the five men went on their way and came to laish and saw the people who were there living without thought of danger like the zidonians quiet and safe for they had everything on earth for their needs and they were far from the zidonians and had no business with aram
 so they came back to their brothers in zorah and eshtaol and their brothers said to them what news have you
 and they said up  and let us go against laish for we have seen the land and it is very good why are you doing nothing do not be slow to go in and take the land for your heritage
 when you come there you will come to a people living without thought of danger and the land is wide and god has given it into your hands a place where there is everything on earth for mans needs
 so six hundred men of the danites from zorah and eshtaol went out armed with instruments of war
 and they went up and put up their tents in kiriath jearim in judah so that place is named mahaneh dan to this day it is to the west of kiriath jearim
 from there they went on to the hill country of ephraim and came to the house of micah
 then the five men who had gone to make a search through the country of laish said to their brothers have you knowledge that in these houses there is an ephod and family gods and a pictured image and a metal image so now you see what to do
 and turning from their road they came to the house of the young levite the house of micah and said to him is it well with you
 and the six hundred armed men of the danites took their places by the doorway
 then the five men who had gone to make a search through the land went in and took the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image and the priest was by the doorway with the six hundred armed men
 and when they went into micahs house and took out the pictured image and the ephod and the family gods and the metal image the priest said to them what are you doing
 and they said to him be quiet say nothing and come with us and be our father and priest is it better for you to be priest to one mans house or to be priest to a tribe and a family in israel
 then the priests heart was glad and he took the ephod and the family gods and the pictured image and went with the people
 so they went on their way again putting the little ones and the oxen and the goods in front of them
 when they had gone some way from the house of micah the men from the houses near micahs house came together and overtook the children of dan
 crying out to them and the danites turning round said to micah what is your trouble that you have taken up arms
 and he said you have taken my gods which i made and my priest and have gone away what is there for me now why then do you say to me what is your trouble
 and the children of dan said to him say no more or men of bitter spirit may make an attack on you causing loss of your life and the lives of your people
 then the children of dan went on their way and when micah saw that they were stronger than he he went back to his house
 and they took that which micah had made and his priest and came to laish to a people living quietly and without thought of danger and they put them to the sword without mercy burning down their town
 and they had no saviour because it was far from zidon and they had no business with aram and it was in the valley which is the property of beth rehob and building up the town again they took it for their living place
 and they gave the town the name of dan after dan their father who was the son of israel though the town had been named laish at first
  and the children of dan put up the pictured image for themselves and jonathan the son of gershom the son of moses and his sons were priests for the tribe of the danites till the day when the ark was taken prisoner 
 and they put up for themselves the image which micah had made and it was there all the time that the house of god was in shiloh
 now in those days when there was no king in israel a certain levite was living in the inmost parts of the hill country of ephraim and he got for himself a servant wife from beth lehem judah
 and his servant wife was angry with him and went away from him to her fathers house at beth lehem judah and was there for four months
 then her husband got up and went after her with the purpose of talking kindly to her and taking her back with him he had with him his young man and two asses and she took him into her fathers house and her father when he saw him came forward to him with joy
 and his father in law the girls father kept him there for three days and they had food and drink and took their rest there
 now on the fourth day they got up early in the morning and he made ready to go away but the girls father said to his son in law take a little food to keep up your strength and then go on your way
 so seating themselves they had food and drink the two of them together and the girls father said to the man if it is your pleasure take your rest here tonight and let your heart be glad
 and the man got up to go away but his father in law would not let him go so he took his rest there again for the night
 then early on the morning of the fifth day he got up to go away but the girls father said keep up your strength so the two of them had a meal and the man and his woman and his servant did not go till after the middle of the day
 and when they got up to go away his father in law the girls father said to him now evening is coming on so do not go tonight see the day is almost gone take your rest here and let your heart be glad and tomorrow early go on your way back to your house
 but the man would not be kept there that night and he got up and went away and came opposite to jebus  which is jerusalem  and he had with him the two asses ready for travelling and his woman
 when they got near jebus the day was far gone and the servant said to his master now let us go from our road into this town of the jebusites and take our nights rest there
 but his master said to him we will not go out of our way into a strange town whose people are not of the children of israel but we will go on to gibeah
 and he said to his servant come let us go on to one of these places stopping for the night in gibeah or ramah
 so they went on their way and the sun went down when they were near gibeah in the land of benjamin
 and they went off the road there with the purpose of stopping for the night in gibeah and he went in seating himself in the street of the town for no one took them into his house for the night
 now when it was evening they saw an old man coming back from his work in the fields he was from the hill country of ephraim and was living in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites
 and when he saw the traveller in the street of the town the old man said where are you going and where do you come from
 and he said to him we are on our way from beth lehem judah to the inmost parts of the hill country of ephraim i came from there and went to beth lehem judah now i am on my way back to my house but no man will take me into his house
 but we have dry grass and food for our asses as well as bread and wine for me and for the woman and for the young man with us we have no need of anything
 and the old man said peace be with you let all your needs be my care only do not take your rest in the street
 so he took them into his house and gave the asses food and after washing their feet they took food and drink
 while they were taking their pleasure at the meal the good for nothing men of the town came round the house giving blows on the door and they said to the old man the master of the house send out that man who came to your house so that we may take our pleasure with him
 so the man the master of the house went out to them and said no my brothers do not this evil thing this man has come into my house and you are not to do him this wrong
 see here is my daughter a virgin and his servant wife i will send them out for you to take them and do with them whatever you will but do no such thing of shame to this man
 but the men would not give ear to him so the man took his woman and sent her out to them and they took her by force using her for their pleasure all night till the morning and when dawn came they let her go
 then at the dawn of day the woman came and falling down at the door of the mans house where her master was was stretched there till it was light
 in the morning her master got up and opening the door of the house went out to go on his way and he saw his servant wife stretched on the earth at the door of the house with her hands on the step
 and he said to her get up and let us be going but there was no answer so he took her up and put her on the ass and went on his way and came to his house
 and when he had come to his house he got his knife and took the woman cutting her up bone by bone into twelve parts which he sent through all israel
 and he gave orders to the men whom he sent saying this is what you are to say to all the men of israel has ever an act like this been done from the day when the children of israel came out of egypt to this day give thought to it turning it over in your minds and give your opinion of it
 now the angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and he said *** i took you out of egypt guiding you into the land which i gave by an oath to your fathers and i said my agreement with you will never be broken by me
 and you are to make no agreement with the people of this land you are to see that their altars are broken down but you have not given ear to my voice what have you done
 and so i have said i will not send them out from before you but they will be a danger to you and their gods will be a cause of falling to you
 now on hearing these words which the angel of the lord said to all the children of israel the people gave themselves up to loud crying and weeping
 and they gave that place the name of bochim and made offerings there to the lord
 and joshua let the people go away and the children of israel went every man to his heritage to take the land for themselves
 and the people were true to the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the responsible men who were still living after the death of joshua and had seen all the great work of the lord which he had done for israel
 and death came to joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord he being a hundred and ten years old
 and they put his body in the earth in the land of his heritage in timnath heres in the hill country of ephraim to the north of mount gaash
 and in time death overtook all that generation and another generation came after them having no knowledge of the lord or of the things which he had done for israel
 and the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord and became servants to the baals
 and they gave up the lord the god of their fathers who had taken them out of the land of egypt and went after other gods the gods of the peoples round about them worshipping them and moving the lord to wrath
 and they gave up the lord and became the servants of baal and the astartes
 and the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the hands of those who violently took their property and into the hands of their haters all round them so that they were forced to give way before them
 wherever they went out the hand of the lord was against them for evil as the lord had taken his oath it would be and things became very hard for them
 then the lord gave them judges as their saviours from the hands of those who were cruel to them
 but still they would not give ear to their judges but went after other gods and gave them worship quickly turning from the way in which their fathers had gone keeping the orders of the lord but they did not do so
 and whenever the lord gave them judges then the lord was with the judge and was their saviour from the hands of their haters all the days of the judge for the lord was moved by their cries of grief because of those who were cruel to them
 but whenever the judge was dead they went back and did more evil than their fathers going after other gods to be their servants and their worshippers giving up nothing of their sins and their hard hearted ways
 and the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he said because this nation has not been true to my agreement which i made with their fathers and has not given ear to my voice
 from now on i will not go on driving out from before them any of the nations which at the death of joshua were still living in this land
 in order to put israel to the test and see if they will keep the way of the lord walking in it as their fathers did or not
 so the lord let those nations go on living in the land not driving them out quickly and did not give them up into the hands of joshua
 then all the children of israel took up arms and the people came together like one man from dan to beer sheba and the land of gilead before the lord at mizpah
 and the chiefs of the people out of all the tribes of israel took their places in the meeting of the people of god four hundred thousand footmen armed with swords
  now the children of benjamin had word that the children of israel had gone up to mizpah  and the children of israel said make clear how this evil thing took place
 then the levite the husband of the dead woman said in answer i came to gibeah in the land of benjamin i and my servant wife for the purpose of stopping there for the night
 and the townsmen of gibeah came together against me going round the house on all sides by night it was their purpose to put me to death and my servant wife was violently used by them and is dead
 so i took her cutting her into parts which i sent through all the country of the heritage of israel for they have done an act of shame in israel
 here you all are you children of israel give now your suggestions about what is to be done
 then all the people got up as one man and said not one of us will go to his tent or go back to his house
 but this is what we will do to gibeah we will go up against it by the decision of the lord
 and we will take ten men out of every hundred through all the tribes of israel a hundred out of every thousand a thousand out of every ten thousand to get food for the people so that they may give to gibeah of benjamin the right punishment for the act of shame they have done in israel
 so all the men of israel were banded together against the town united like one man
 and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin saying what is this evil which has been done among you
 now give up those good for nothing persons in gibeah so that we may put them to death clearing away the evil from israel but the children of benjamin would not give ear to the voice of their brothers the children of israel
 and the children of benjamin came together from all their towns to gibeah to go to war with the children of israel
 and the children of benjamin who came that day from the towns were twenty six thousand men armed with swords in addition to the people of gibeah numbering seven hundred of the best fighting men
 who were left handed able to send a stone at a hair without error
 and the men of israel other than benjamin were four hundred thousand in number all armed with swords they were all men of war
 and they got up and went up to beth el to get directions from god and the children of israel said who is to be the first to go up to the fight against the children of benjamin and the lord said judah is to go up first
 so the children of israel got up in the morning and put themselves in position against gibeah
 and the men of israel went out to war against benjamin  and the men of israel put their forces in fighting order against them at gibeah 
 then the children of benjamin came out from gibeah cutting down twenty two thousand of the israelites that day
 but the people the men of israel taking heart again put their forces in order and took up the same position as on the first day
 now the children of israel went up weeping before the lord till evening requesting the lord and saying am i to go forward again to the fight against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord said go up against him
 so the children of israel went forward against the children of benjamin the second day
 and the second day benjamin went out against them from gibeah cutting down eighteen thousand men of the children of israel all swordsmen
 then all the children of israel and all the people went up to beth el weeping and waiting there before the lord going without food all day till evening and offering burned offerings and peace offerings before the lord
 and the children of israel made request to the lord  for the ark of the agreement of the lord was there in those days
 and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron was in his place before it  and said am i still to go on with the fight against the children of benjamin my brother or am i to give it up and the lord said go on for tomorrow i will give him into your hands
 so israel put men secretly all round gibeah to make a surprise attack on it
 and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and put themselves in fighting order against gibeah as before
 and the children of benjamin went out against the people moving away from the town and as before at their first attack they put to death about thirty men of israel on the highways of which one goes up to beth el and the other to gibeah and in the open country
 and the children of benjamin said they are giving way before us as at first but the children of israel said let us go in flight and get them away from the town into the highways
 so all the men of israel got up and put themselves in fighting order at baal tamar and those who had been waiting secretly to make a surprise attack came rushing out of their place on the west of geba
 and they came in front of gibeah ten thousand of the best men in all israel and the fighting became more violent but the children of benjamin were not conscious that evil was coming on them
 then the lord sent sudden fear on benjamin before israel and that day the children of israel put to death twenty five thousand one hundred men of benjamin all of them swordsmen
 so the children of benjamin saw that they were overcome and the men of israel had given way before benjamin putting their faith in the watchers who were to make the surprise attack on gibeah
 and the watchers rushing on gibeah and overrunning it put all the town to the sword without mercy
 now the sign fixed between the men of israel and those making the surprise attack was that when they made a pillar of smoke go up from the town
 the men of israel were to make a turn about in the fight and benjamin had overcome and put to death about thirty of the men of israel and were saying certainly they are falling back before us as in the first fight
 then the sign went up out of the town in the pillar of smoke and the benjamites turning back saw all the town going up in smoke to heaven
 and the men of israel had made a turn about and the men of benjamin were overcome with fear for they saw that evil had overtaken them
 so turning their backs on the men of israel they went in the direction of the waste land but the fight overtook them and those who came out of the town were heading them off and putting them to the sword
 and crushing benjamin down they went after them driving them from nohah as far as the east side of gibeah
 eighteen thousand men of benjamin came to their death all strong men of war
 and turning they went in flight to the rock of rimmon in the waste land and on the highways five thousand of them were cut off by the men of israel who pushing on hard after them to geba put to death two thousand more
 so twenty five thousand of the swordsmen of benjamin came to their end that day all strong men of war
 but six hundred men turning back went in flight to the rock of rimmon in the waste land and were living on the rock of rimmon for four months
 and the men of israel turning again against the children of benjamin put to the sword without mercy all the towns and the cattle and everything there was burning every town which came into their hands
 now the men of israel had taken an oath in mizpah saying not one of us will give his daughter as a wife to benjamin
 and the people came to beth el waiting there till evening before god and gave themselves up to bitter weeping
 and they said o lord the god of israel why has this fate come on israel that today one tribe has been cut off from israel
 then on the day after the people got up early and made an altar there offering burned offerings and peace offerings
 and the children of israel said who is there among all the tribes of israel who did not come up to the lord at the meeting of all israel for they had taken a great oath that whoever did not come up to mizpah to the lord was to be put to death
 and the children of israel were moved with pity for benjamin their brother saying today one tribe has been cut off from israel
 what are we to do about wives for those who are still living for we have taken an oath by the lord that we will not give them our daughters for wives
 and they said which one of the tribes of israel did not come up to mizpah to the lord and it was seen that no one had come from jabesh gilead to the meeting
 for when the people were numbered not one man of the people of jabesh gilead was present
 so they  the meeting  sent twelve thousand of the best fighting men and gave them orders saying go and put the people of jabesh gilead to the sword without mercy with their women and their little ones
 and this is what you are to do every male and every woman who has had sex relations with a man you are to put to the curse but you are to keep safe the virgins and they did so
 now there were among the people of jabesh gilead four hundred young virgins who had never had sex relations with a man these they took to their tents in shiloh in the land of canaan
 and all the meeting sent to the men of benjamin who were in the rock of rimmon offering them peace
 then benjamin came back and they gave them the women whom they had kept from death among the women of jabesh gilead but still there were not enough for them
 and the people were moved with pity for benjamin because the lord had let his wrath loose on the tribes of israel
 then the responsible men of the meeting said what are we to do about wives for the rest of them seeing that the women of benjamin are dead
 and they said how is the rest of benjamin to be given offspring so that one tribe of israel may not be put out of existence
 seeing that we may not give them our daughters as wives for the children of israel had taken an oath saying cursed is he who gives a wife to benjamin
 and they said see every year there is a feast of the lord in shiloh which is to the north of beth el on the east side of the highway which goes up from beth el to shechem and on the south of lebonah
 and they said to the men of benjamin go into the vine gardens waiting there secretly
 and watching and if the daughters of shiloh come out to take part in the dances then come from the vine gardens and take a wife for every one of you from among the daughters of shiloh and go back to the land of benjamin
 and when their fathers or their brothers come and make trouble you are to say to them give them to us as an act of grace for we did not take them as wives for ourselves in war and if you yourselves had given them to us you would have been responsible for the broken oath
 so the men of benjamin did this and got wives for themselves for every one of their number taking them away by force from the dance then they went back to their heritage building up their towns and living in them
 then the children of israel went away from there every man to his tribe and his family every man went back to his heritage
 in those days there was no king in israel every man did what seemed right to him
 now these are the nations which the lord kept in the land for the purpose of testing israel by them all those who had had no experience of all the wars of canaan
 only because of the generations of the children of israel for the purpose of teaching them war  only those who up till then had no experience of it
 the five chiefs of the philistines and all the canaanites and the zidonians and the hivites living in mount lebanon from the mountain baal hermon as far as hamath
 for the purpose of testing israel by them to see if they would give ear to the orders of the lord which he had given to their fathers by the hand of moses
 now the children of israel were living among the canaanites the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites
 and they took as wives the daughters of these nations and gave their daughters to their sons and became servants to their gods
 and the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord and put out of their minds the lord their god and became servants to the baals and the astartes
 so the wrath of the lord was burning against israel and he gave them up into the hands of cushan rishathaim king of mesopotamia and the children of israel were his servants for eight years
 and when the children of israel made prayer to the lord he gave them a saviour othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother
 and the spirit of the lord came on him and he became judge of israel and went out to war and the lord gave up cushan rishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hands and he overcame him
 then for forty years the land had peace till the death of othniel the son of kenaz
 then the children of israel again did evil in the eyes of the lord and the lord made eglon king of moab strong against israel because they had done evil in the lords eyes
 and eglon got together the people of ammon and amalek and they went and overcame israel and took the town of palm trees
 and the children of israel were servants to eglon king of moab for eighteen years
 then when the children of israel made prayer to the lord he gave them a saviour ehud the son of gera the benjamite a left handed man and the children of israel sent an offering by him to eglon king of moab
 so ehud made himself a two edged sword a cubit long which he put on at his right side under his robe
 and he took the offering to eglon king of moab who was a very fat man
 and after giving the offering he sent away the people who had come with the offering
 but he himself turning back from the stone images at gilgal said i have something to say to you in secret o king and he said let there be quiet then all those who were waiting before him went out
 then ehud came in to him while he was seated by himself in his summer house and ehud said i have a word from god for you and he got up from his seat
 and ehud put out his left hand and took the sword from his right side and sent it into his stomach
 and the hand part went in after the blade and the fat was joined up over the blade for he did not take the sword out of his stomach and he went out into the 
 then ehud went out into the covered way shutting the doors of the summer house on him and locking them
 now when he had gone the kings servants came and saw that the doors of the summer house were locked and they said it may be that he is in his summer house for a private purpose
 and they went on waiting till they were shamed but the doors were still shut so they took the key and opening them saw their lord stretched out dead on the floor
 but ehud had got away while they were waiting and had gone past the stone images and got away to seirah
 and when he came there he had a horn sounded in the hill country of ephraim and all the children of israel went down with him from the hill country and he at their head
 and he said to them come after me for the lord has given the moabites your haters into your hands so they went down after him and took the crossing places of jordan against moab and let no one go across
 at that time they put about ten thousand men of moab to the sword every strong man and every man of war not a man got away
 so moab was broken that day under the hand of israel and for eighty years the land had peace
 and after him came shamgar the son of anath who put to death six hundred philistines with an ox stick and he was another saviour of israel
 and the children of israel again did evil in the eyes of the lord when ehud was dead
 and the lord gave them up into the hands of jabin king of canaan who was ruling in hazor the captain of his army was sisera who was living in harosheth of the gentiles
 then the children of israel made prayer to the lord for he had nine hundred iron war carriages and for twenty years he was very cruel to the children of israel
 now deborah a woman prophet the wife of lapidoth was judge of israel at that time
  and she had her seat under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and beth el in the hill country of ephraim and the children of israel came up to her to be judged 
 and she sent for barak the son of abinoam from kedesh naphtali and said to him has not the lord the god of israel given orders saying go and get your force into line in mount tabor and take with you ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun
 and i will make sisera the captain of jabins army with his war carriages and his forces come against you at the river kishon where i will give him into your hands
 and barak said to her if you will go with me then i will go but if you will not go with me i will not go
 and she said i will certainly go with you though you will get no honour in your undertaking for the lord will give sisera into the hands of a woman so deborah got up and went with barak to kedesh
 then barak sent for zebulun and naphtali to come to kedesh and ten thousand men went up after him and deborah went up with him
 now heber the kenite separating himself from the rest of the kenites from the children of hobab the brother in law of moses had put up his tent as far away as the oak tree in zaanannim by kedesh
 and word was given to sisera that barak the son of abinoam had gone up to mount tabor
 so sisera got together all his war carriages nine hundred war carriages of iron and all the people who were with him from harosheth of the gentiles as far as the river kishon
 then deborah said to barak up  for today the lord has given sisera into your hands has not the lord gone out before you so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him
 and the lord sent fear on sisera and all his war carriages and all his army before barak and sisera got down from his war carriage and went in flight on foot
 but barak went after the war carriages and the army as far as harosheth of the gentiles and all siseras army was put to the sword not a man got away
 but sisera went in flight on foot to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin king of hazor and the family of heber the kenite
 and jael went out to sisera and said to him come in my lord come in to me without fear so he went into her tent and she put a cover over him
 then he said to her give me now a little water for i have need of a drink and opening a skin of milk she gave him drink and put the cover over him again
 and he said to her take your place at the door of the tent and if anyone comes and says to you is there any man here say no
 then jael hebers wife took a tent pin and a hammer and went up to him quietly driving the pin into his head and it went through his head into the earth for he was in a deep sleep from weariness and so he came to his end
 then jael went out and meeting barak going after sisera said to him come and i will let you see the man you are searching for so he came into her tent and saw and there was sisera stretched out dead with the tent pin in his head
 so that day god overcame jabin king of canaan before the children of israel
 and the power of the children of israel went on increasing against jabin king of canaan till he was cut off
 at that time deborah and barak the son of abinoam made this song saying
 because of the flowing hair of the fighters in israel because the people gave themselves freely give praise to the lord
 give attention o kings give ear o rulers i even i will make a song to the lord i will make melody to the lord the god of israel
 lord when you went out from seir moving like an army from the field of edom the earth was shaking and the heavens were troubled and the clouds were dropping water
 the mountains were shaking before the lord before the lord the god of israel
 in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the highways were not used and travellers went by side roads
 country towns were no more in israel *** were no more till you deborah came up till you came up as a mother in israel
 they had no one to make arms there were no more armed men in the towns was there a body cover or a spear to be seen among forty thousand in israel
 come you rulers of israel you who gave yourselves freely among the people give praise to the lord
 let them give thought to it who go on white asses and those who are walking on the road
 give ear to the women laughing by the water springs there they will give again the story of the upright acts of the lord all the upright acts of his arm in israel
 awake  awake  deborah awake  awake  give a song up  barak and take prisoner those who took you prisoner o son of abinoam
 then the chiefs went down to the doors the lords people went down among the strong ones
 out of ephraim they came down into the valley after you benjamin among your tribesmen from machir came down the captains and from zebulun those in whose hand is the rulers rod
 your chiefs issachar were with deborah and naphtali was true to barak into the valley they went rushing out at his feet in reuben there were divisions and great searchings of heart
 why did you keep quiet among the sheep hearing nothing but the watchers piping to the flocks
 gilead was living over jordan and dan was waiting in his ships asher kept in his place by the seas edge living by his inlets
 it was the people of zebulun who put their lives in danger even to death with naphtali on the high places of the field
 the kings came on to the fight the kings of canaan were warring in taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no profit in money
 the stars from heaven were fighting from their highways they were fighting against sisera
 the river kishon took them violently away stopping their flight the river kishon give praise o my soul to the strength of the lord 
 then loudly the feet of the horses were sounding with the stamping the stamping of their war horses
 a curse a curse on meroz  said the angel of the lord a bitter curse on her townspeople  because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord among the strong ones
 blessings be on jael more than on all women  blessings greater than on any in the tents 
 his request was for water she gave him milk she put butter before him on a fair plate
 she put out her hand to the tent pin and her right hand to the workmans hammer and she gave sisera a blow crushing his head wounding and driving through his brow
 bent at her feet he went down he was stretched out bent at her feet he went down where he was bent down there he went down in death
 looking out from the window she gave a cry the mother of sisera was crying out through the window why is his carriage so long in coming when will the noise of his wheels be sounding
 her wise women gave answer to her yes she made answer again to herself
 are they not getting are they not parting the goods among them a young girl or two to every man and to sisera robes of coloured needlework worked in fair colours on this side and on that for the neck of the queen
 so may destruction come on all your haters o lord but let your lovers be like the sun going out in his strength and for forty years the land had peace
 and the children of israel did evil in the eyes of the lord and the lord gave them up into the hand of midian for seven years
 and midian was stronger than israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made holes for themselves in the mountains and hollows in the rocks and strong places
 and whenever israels grain was planted the midianites and the amalekites and the people of the east came up against them
 and put their army in position against them and they took all the produce of the earth as far as gaza till there was no food in israel or any sheep or oxen or asses
 for they came up regularly with their oxen and their tents they came like the locusts in number they and their camels were without number and they came into the land for its destruction
 and israel was in great need because of midian and the cry of the children of israel went up to the lord
 and when the cry of the children of israel because of midian came before the lord
 the lord sent a prophet to the children of israel who said to them the lord the god of israel has said i took you up from egypt out of the prison house
 and i took you out of the hands of the egyptians and out of the hands of all who were cruel to you and i sent them out by force from before you and gave you their land
 and i said to you i am the lord your god you are not to give worship to the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but you did not give ear to my voice
 now the angel of the lord came and took his seat under the oak tree in ophrah in the field of joash the abiezrite and his son gideon was crushing grain in the place where the grapes were crushed so that the midianites might not see it
 and the angel of the lord came before his eyes and said to him the lord is with you o man of war
 then gideon said to him o my lord if the lord is with us why has all this come on us and where are all his works of power of which our fathers have given us word saying did not the lord take us out of egypt but now he has given us up handing us over to the power of midian
 and the lord turning to him said go in the strength you have and be israels saviour from midian have i not sent you
 and he said to him o lord how may i be the saviour of israel see my family is the poorest in manasseh and i am the least in my fathers house
 then the lord said to him truly i will be with you and you will overcome the midianites as if they were one man
 so he said to him if now i have grace in your eyes then give me a sign that it is you who are talking to me
 do not go away till i come with my offering and put it before you and he said i will not go away before you come back
 then gideon went in and made ready a young goat and with an ephah of meal he made unleavened cakes he put the meat in a basket and the soup in which it had been cooked he put in a pot and he took it out to him under the oak tree and gave it to him there
 and the angel of god said to him take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them down on the rock over there draining out the soup over them and he did so
 then the angel of the lord put out the stick which was in his hand touching the meat and the cakes with the end of it and a flame came up out of the rock burning up the meat and the cakes and the angel of the lord was seen no longer
 then gideon was certain that he was the angel of the lord and gideon said i am in fear o lord god  for i have seen the angel of the lord face to face
 but the lord said to him peace be with you have no fear you are in no danger of death
 then gideon made an altar there to the lord and gave it the name yahweh shalom to this day it is in ophrah of the abiezrites
 the same night the lord said to him take ten men of your servants and an ox seven years old and after pulling down the altar of baal which is your fathers and cutting down the holy tree by its side
 make an altar to the lord your god on the top of this rock in the ordered way and take the ox and make a burned offering with the wood of the holy tree which has been cut down
 then gideon took ten of his servants and did as the lord had said to him but fearing to do it by day because of his fathers people and the men of the town he did it by night
 and the men of the town got up early in the morning and they saw the altar of baal broken down and the holy tree which was by it cut down and the ox offered on the altar which had been put up there
 and they said to one another who has done this thing and after searching with care they said gideon the son of joash has done this thing
 then the men of the town said to joash make your son come out to be put to death for pulling down the altar of baal and cutting down the holy tree which was by it
 but joash said to all those who were attacking him will you take up the cause of baal will you be his saviour let anyone who will take up his cause be put to death while it is still morning if he is a god let him take up his cause himself because of the pulling down of his altar
 so that day he gave him the name of jerubbaal saying let baal take up his cause against him because his altar has been broken down
 then all the midianites and the amalekites and the people of the east banding themselves together went over and put up their tents in the valley of jezreel
 but the spirit of the lord came on gideon and at the sound of his horn all abiezer came together after him
 and he sent through all manasseh and they came after him and he sent to asher and zebulun and naphtali and they came up and were joined to the others
 then gideon said to god if you are going to give israel salvation by my hand as you have said
 see i will put the wool of a sheep on the grain floor if there is dew on the wool only while all the earth is dry then i will be certain that it is your purpose to give israel salvation by my hand as you have said
 and it was so for he got up early on the morning after and twisting the wool in his hands he got a basin full of water from the dew on the wool
 then gideon said to god do not be moved to wrath against me if i say only this let me make one more test with the wool let the wool now be dry while the earth is covered with dew
 and that night god did so for the wool was dry and there was dew on all the earth round it
 then jerubbaal that is gideon and all the people with him got up early and put up their tents by the side of the water spring of harod the tents of midian were on the north side of him under the hill of moreh in the valley
 and the lord said to gideon so great is the number of your people that if i give the midianites into their hands they will be uplifted in pride over me and will say i myself have been my saviour
 so now let it be given out to the people that anyone who is shaking with fear is to go back from mount galud so twenty two thousand of the people went back but there were still ten thousand
 then the lord said to gideon there are still more people than is necessary take them down to the water so that i may put them to the test for you there then whoever i say is to go with you will go and whoever i say is not to go will not go
 so he took the people down to the water and the lord said to gideon put on one side by themselves all those drinking up the water with their tongues like a dog and in the same way all those who go down on their knees to the water while drinking
 now the number of those who took up the water with their tongues was three hundred all the rest of the people went down on their knees to the water
 and the lord said to gideon by those three hundred who were drinking with their tongues i will give you salvation and give the midianites into your hands let the rest of the people go away every man to his place
 so they took the vessels of the people and their horns from their hands and he sent them away every man to his tent keeping only the three hundred and the tents of midian were lower down in the valley
 the same night the lord said to him up  go down now against their army for i have given them into your hands
 but if you have fear of going down take your servant purah with you and go down to the tents
 and after hearing what they are saying you will get strength to go down against the army so he went down with his servant purah to the outer line of the tents of the armed men
 now the midianites and the amalekites and all the people of the east were covering the valley like locusts and their camels were like the sand by the seaside without number
 when gideon came there a man was giving his friend an account of his dream saying see i had a dream about a cake of barley bread which falling into the tents of midian came on to the tent overturning it so that it was stretched out flat on the earth
 and his friend in answer said this is certainly the sword of gideon the son of joash the men of israel into their hands god has given up all the army of midian
 then gideon hearing the story of the dream and the sense in which they took it gave worship then he went back to the tents of israel and said up  for the lord has given the army of midian into your hands
 then separating the three hundred men into three bands he gave every man a horn and a vessel in which was a flaming branch
 and he said to them keep your eyes on me and do what i do when i come to the outer line of tents whatever i do you are to do the same
 at the sound of my horn and the horns of those who are with me let your horns be sounded all round the tents and say for the lord and for gideon
 so gideon and the three hundred men who were with him came to the outer line of tents at the start of the middle watch when the watchmen had only then taken their stations and the horns were sounded and the vessels broken
 so the three bands all gave a loud note on their horns and when the vessels had been broken they took the flaming branches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands ready for blowing crying out for the lord and for gideon
 then they made a line round the tents every man in his place and all the army awaking from sleep came running out and with loud cries went in flight
 and the three hundred gave a loud note on their horns and every mans sword was turned by the lord against his brother all through the army and the army went in flight as far as beth shittah in the direction of zeredah to the edge of abel meholah by tabbath
 and the men of israel came together from naphtali and from asher and all manasseh and went after midian
 then gideon sent through all the hill country of ephraim saying come down against midian and keep the ways across jordan before they come so all the men of ephraim massing themselves together kept the ways across jordan
 and they took the two chiefs of midian oreb and zeeb and they put oreb to death at the rock of oreb and zeeb they put to death at the place of the grape crushing in zeeb and they went after midian but the heads of oreb and zeeb they took across jordan to gideon
 and the men of ephraim came and said to him why did you not send for us when you went to war against midian and they said sharp and angry words to him
 and he said to them what have i done in comparison with you is not that which ephraim took up after the grape cutting better than all the grapes which abiezer got in from the grape cutting
 god has given into your hands the chiefs of midian oreb and zeeb what have i been able to do in comparison with you and when he said this their feeling about him became kinder
 then gideon came to jordan and went over it with his three hundred overcome with weariness and in need of food
 and he said to the men of succoth give bread cakes to my people for they are overcome with weariness and i am going on after zebah and zalmunna the kings of midian
 but the chiefs of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army
 then gideon said because of this when the lord has given zebah and zalmunna into my hands i will have you stretched on a bed of thorns of the waste land and on sharp stems and have you crushed as grain is crushed on a grain floor
 so he went up from there to penuel and made the same request to the men of penuel but they gave him the same answer as the men of succoth had given
 so he said to the men of penuel when i come back in peace i will have this tower broken down
 now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their armies with them about fifteen thousand men those of all the army of the children of the east who were still living for a hundred and twenty thousand of their swordsmen had been put to death
 and gideon went up by the way used by the people living in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and made an attack on the army when they had no thought of danger
 and zebah and zalmunna went in flight and he went after them and took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and put all the army to the curse
 then gideon the son of joash went back from the fight
 and taking prisoner a young man of the people of succoth he got from him in answer to his questions a list of the chiefs of succoth and the responsible men seventy seven men
 so he came to the men of succoth and said here are zebah and zalmunna on account of whom you made sport of me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army who are overcome with weariness
 then he took the responsible men of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems
 and he had the tower of penuel broken down and the men of the town put to death
 then he said to zebah and zalmunna where are the men whom you put to death at tabor and they gave answer as you are so were they every one of them was like a kings son
 and he said they were my brothers my mothers sons by the life of the lord if you had kept them safe i would not put you to death
 then he said to jether his oldest son up  put them to death but the boy did not take out his sword fearing because he was still a boy
 then zebah and zalmunna said up  put an end to us yourself for you have a mans strength then gideon got up and put zebah and zalmunna to death and took the ornaments which were on their camels necks
 then the men of israel said to gideon be our ruler you and your son and your sons son after him for you have been our saviour from the hands of midian
 but gideon said to them i will not be a ruler over you and my son will not be a ruler over you it is the lord who will be ruler over you
 then gideon said to them i have a request to make to you let every man give me the ear rings he has taken  for they had gold ear rings because they were ishmaelites 
 and they gave answer we will gladly give them so they put down a robe every man dropping into it the ear rings he had taken
 the weight of the gold ear rings which he got from them was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold in addition to the moon ornaments and jewels and the purple robes which were on the kings of midian and the chains on their camels necks
 and gideon made an ephod from them and put it up in his town ophrah and all israel went after it there and were false to the lord and it became a cause of sin to gideon and his house
 so midian was broken before the children of israel and the midianites never got back their strength and the land had peace for forty years in the days of gideon
 and jerubbaal the son of joash went back to his house and was living there
 gideon had seventy sons the offspring of his body for he had a number of wives
 and the servant wife he had in shechem had a son by him to whom he gave the name abimelech
 and gideon the son of joash came to his end when he was very old and his body was put in the resting place of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites
 and after the death of gideon the children of israel again went after the gods of canaan and were false to the lord and made baal berith their god
 and the children of israel did not keep in their minds the lord their god who had been their saviour from all their haters on every side
 and they were not kind to the house of jerubbaal that is gideon in reward for all the good he had done to israel
 now abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem to his mothers family and said to them and to all the family of his mothers father
 say now in the ears of all the townsmen of shechem is it better for you to be ruled by all the seventy sons of jerubbaal or by one man only and keep in mind that i am your bone and your flesh
 so his mothers family said all this about him in the ears of all the townsmen of shechem and their hearts were turned to abimelech for they said he is our brother
 and they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the house of baal berith with which abimelech got the support of a number of uncontrolled and good for nothing persons
 then he went to his fathers house at ophrah and put his brothers the seventy sons of jerubbaal to death on the same stone however jotham the youngest kept himself safe by going away to a secret place
 and all the townsmen of shechem and all beth millo came together and went and made abimelech their king by the oak of the pillar in shechem
 now jotham on hearing of it went to the top of mount gerizim and crying out with a loud voice said to them give ear to me you townsmen of shechem so that god may give ear to you
 one day the trees went out to make a king for themselves and they said to the olive tree be king over us
 but the olive tree said to them am i to give up my wealth of oil by which men give honour to god and go waving over the trees
 then the trees said to the fig tree you come and be king over us
 but the fig tree said to them am i to give up my sweet taste and my good fruit and go waving over the trees
 then the trees said to the vine you come and be king over us
 but the vine said to them am i to give up my wine which makes glad god and men to go waving over the trees
 then all the trees said to the thorn you come and be king over us
 and the thorn said to the trees if it is truly your desire to make me your king then come and put your faith in my shade and if not may fire come out of the thorn burning up the cedars of lebanon
 so now if you have done truly and uprightly in making abimelech king and if you have done well to jerubbaal and his house in reward for the work of his hands
  for my father made war for you and put his life in danger and made you free from the hands of midian
 and you have gone against my fathers family this day and have put to death his sons even seventy men on one stone and have made abimelech the son of his servant wife king over the townsmen of shechem because he is your brother 
 if then you have done what is true and upright to jerubbaal and his family this day may you have joy in abimelech and may he have joy in you
 but if not may fire come out from abimelech burning up the townsmen of shechem and beth millo and may fire come out from the townsmen of shechem and beth millo for the destruction of abimelech
 then jotham straight away went in flight to beer and was living there for fear of his brother abimelech
 so abimelech was chief over israel for three years
 and god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the townsmen of shechem and the townsmen of shechem were false to abimelech
 so that punishment for the violent attack made on the seventy sons of jerubbaal and for their blood might come on abimelech their brother who put them to death and on the townsmen of shechem who gave him their help in putting his brothers to death
 and the townsmen of shechem put secret watchers on the tops of the mountains and they made attacks on all who went by on the road and took their goods and word of this came to abimelech
 then gaal the son of ebed came with his brothers and went over to shechem and the men of shechem put their faith in him
 and they went out into their fields and got in the fruit of their vines and when the grapes had been crushed they made a holy feast and went into the house of their god and over their food and drink they were cursing abimelech
 and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we are to be his servants is it not right for the son of jerubbaal and zebul his captain to be servants to the men of hamor the father of shechem but why are we to be his servants
 if only i had authority over this people  i would put abimelech out of the way and i would say to abimelech make your army strong and come out
 now zebul the ruler of the town hearing what gaal the son of ebed had said was moved to wrath
 and he sent to abimelech at arumah saying see gaal the son of ebed and his brothers have come to shechem and they are working up the town against you
 so now get up by night you and your people and keep watch in the field secretly
 and in the morning when the sun is up get up early and make a rush on the town and when he and his people come out against you do to them whatever you have a chance to do
 so abimelech and the people with him got up by night in four bands to make a surprise attack on shechem
 and gaal the son of ebed went out and took his place at the doorway into the town then abimelech and his people got up from the place where they had been waiting
 and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul see  people are coming down from the tops of the mountains and zebul said to him you see the shade of the mountains like men
 and gaal said again see  people are coming down from the middle of the land and one band is coming by way of the oak tree of the seers
 then zebul said to him now where is your loud talk when you said who is abimelech that we are to be his servants is this not the people whom you were rating so low go out now and make war on them
 so gaal went out at the head of the townsmen of shechem and made war on abimelech
 and abimelech went after him and he went in flight before him and a great number were falling by the sword all the way up to the town
 then abimelech went back to arumah and zebul sent gaal and his brothers away and would not let them go on living in shechem
 now the day after the people went out into the fields and news of it came to abimelech
 and he took his people separating them into three bands and was waiting secretly in the field and when he saw the people coming out of the town he went up and made an attack on them
 and abimelech with his band made a rush and took up their position at the doorway into the town and the other two bands made a rush on all those who were in the fields and overcame them
 and all that day abimelech was fighting against the town and he took it and put to death the people who were in it and had the town pulled down and covered with salt
 then all the townsmen of the tower of shechem hearing of it went into the inner room of the house of el berith
 and word was given to abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were there together
 then abimelech went up to mount zalmon with all his people and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cutting down branches of trees took them and put them on his back and he said to the people who were with him be quick and do as you have seen me do
 so all the people got branches every man cutting down a branch and they went with abimelech at their head and massing the branches against the inner room put fire to the room over them so all those who were in the tower of shechem about a thousand men and women were burned to death with it
 then abimelech went to thebez and put his army in position against thebez and took it
 but in the middle of the town there was a strong tower to which all the men and women of the town went in flight and shutting themselves in went up to the roof of the tower
 and abimelech came to the tower and made an attack on it and got near to the door of the tower for the purpose of firing it
 but a certain woman sent a great stone such as is used for crushing grain on to the head of abimelech cracking the bone
 then quickly crying out to his body servant he said to him take out your sword and put an end to me straight away so that men may not say of me his death was the work of a woman so the young man put his sword through him causing his death
 and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they went away every man to his place
 in this way abimelech was rewarded by god for the evil he had done to his father in putting his seventy brothers to death
 and god sent back on to the heads of the men of shechem all the evil they had done and the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal came on them
 see her seated by herself the town which was full of people  she who was great among the nations has become like a widow  she who was a princess among the countries has come under the yoke of forced work 
 she is sorrowing bitterly in the night and her face is wet with weeping among all her lovers she has no comforter all her friends have been false to her they have become her haters
 judah has been taken away as a prisoner because of trouble and hard work her living place is among the nations there is no rest for her all her attackers have overtaken her in a narrow place
 the ways of zion are sad because no one comes to the holy meeting all her doorways are made waste her priests are breathing out sorrow her virgins are troubled and it is bitter for her
 those who are against her have become the head everything goes well for her haters for the lord has sent sorrow on her because of the great number of her sins her young children have gone away as prisoners before the attacker
 and all her glory has gone from the daughter of zion her rulers have become like harts with no place for food and they have gone in flight without strength before the attacker
 jerusalem keeps in mind in the days of her sorrow and of her wanderings all the desired things which were hers in days gone by when her people came into the power of her hater and she had no helper her attackers saw their desire effected on her and made sport of her destruction
 great is the sin of jerusalem for this cause she has become an unclean thing all those who gave her honour are looking down on her because they have seen her shame now truly breathing out grief she is turned back
 in her skirts were her unclean ways she gave no thought to her end and her fall has been a wonder she has no comforter see her sorrow o lord for the attacker is lifted up
 the hand of her hater is stretched out over all her desired things for she has seen that the nations have come into her holy place about whom you gave orders that they were not to come into the meeting of your people
 breathing out grief all her people are looking for bread they have given their desired things for food to give them life see o lord and take note for she has become a thing of shame
 come to me all you who go by  keep your eyes on me and see if there is any pain like the pain of my wound which the lord has sent on me in the day of his burning wrath
 from on high he has sent fire into my bones and it has overcome them his net is stretched out for my feet i am turned back by him he has made me waste and feeble all the day
 a watch is kept on my sins they are joined together by his hand they have come on to my neck he has made my strength give way the lord has given me up into the hands of those against whom i have no power
 the lord has made sport of all my men of war in me he has got men together against me to send destruction on my young men the virgin daughter of judah has been crushed like grapes under the feet of the lord
 for these things i am weeping my eye is streaming with water because the comforter who might give me new life is far from me my children are made waste because the hater is strong
 zions hands are outstretched she has no comforter the lord has given orders to the attackers of jacob round about him jerusalem has become like an unclean thing among them
 the lord is upright for i have gone against his orders give ear now all you peoples and see my pain my virgins and my young men have gone away as prisoners
 i sent for my lovers but they were false to me my priests and my responsible men were breathing their last breath in the town while they were looking for food to give them new life
 see o lord for i am in trouble the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved my heart is turned in me for i have been uncontrolled outside the children are put to the sword and in the house there is death
 give ear to the voice of my grief i have no comforter all my haters have news of my troubles they are glad because you have done it let the day of fate come when they will be like me
 let all their evil doing come before you do to them as you have done to me for all my sins for loud is the sound of my grief and the strength of my heart is gone
 how has the daughter of zion been covered with a cloud by the lord in his wrath  he has sent down from heaven to earth the glory of israel and has not kept in memory the resting place of his feet in the day of his wrath
 the lord has given up to destruction all the living places of jacob without pity pulling down in his wrath the strong places of the daughter of judah stretching out on the earth the wounded even her king and her rulers
 in his burning wrath every horn of israel has been cut off his right hand has been turned back before the attacker he has put a fire in jacob causing destruction round about
 his bow has been bent for the attack he has taken his place with his hand ready in his hate he has put to death all who were pleasing to the eye on the tent of the daughter of zion he has let loose his passion like fire
 the lord has become like one fighting against her sending destruction on israel he has sent destruction on all her great houses making waste his strong places increasing the grief and the sorrow of the daughter of judah
 and he has violently taken away his tent as from a garden he has made waste his meeting place the lord has taken away the memory of feast and sabbath in zion and in the passion of his wrath he is against king and priest
 the lord has given up his altar and has been turned in hate from his holy place he has given up into the hands of the attacker the walls of her great houses their voices have been loud in the house of the lord as in the day of a holy meeting
 it is the lords purpose to make waste the wall of the daughter of zion his line has been stretched out he has not kept back his hand from destruction he has sent sorrow on tower and wall they have become feeble together
 her doors have gone down into the earth he has sent destruction on her locks her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not even her prophets have had no vision from the lord
 the responsible men of the daughter of zion are seated on the earth without a word they have put dust on their heads they are clothed in haircloth the heads of the virgins of jerusalem are bent down to the earth
 my eyes are wasted with weeping the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved my inner parts are drained out on the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people because of the young children and babies at the breast who are falling without strength in the open squares of the town
 they say to their mothers where is grain and wine when they are falling like the wounded in the open squares of the town when their life is drained out on their mothers breast
 what example am i to give you what comparison am i to make for you o daughter of jerusalem what am i to make equal to you so that i may give you comfort o virgin daughter of zion for your destruction is great like the sea who is able to make you well
 the visions which your prophets have seen for you are false and foolish they have not made clear to you your sin so that your fate might be changed but they have seen for you false words driving you away
 all who go by make a noise with their hands at you they make hisses shaking their heads at the daughter of jerusalem and saying is this the town which was the crown of everything beautiful the joy of all the earth
 all your haters are opening their mouths wide against you making hisses and whistling through their teeth they say we have made a meal of her certainly this is the day we have been looking for it has come we have seen it
 the lord has done that which was his purpose he has put into force the orders which he gave in the days which are past pulling down without pity he has made your hater glad over you lifting up the horn of those who were against you
 let your cry go up to the lord o wall of the daughter of zion let your weeping be flowing down like a stream day and night give yourself no rest let not your eyes keep back the drops of sorrow
 up  give cries in the night at the starting of the night watches let your heart be flowing out like water before the face of the lord lifting up your hands to him for the life of your young children who are falling down feeble for need of food at the top of every street
 look  o lord see to whom you have done this  are the women to take as their food the fruit of their bodies the children who are folded in their arms are the priest and the prophet to be put to death in the holy place of the lord
 the young men and the old are stretched on the earth in the streets my virgins and my young men have been put to the sword you have sent death on them in the day of your wrath causing death without pity
 as in the day of a holy meeting you have made fears come round me on every side and no one got away or was kept safe in the day of the lords wrath those who were folded in my arms whom i took care of have been sent to their destruction by my hater
 i am the man who has seen trouble by the rod of his wrath
 by him i have been made to go in the dark where there is no light
 truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day
 my flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken
 he has put up a wall against me shutting me in with bitter sorrow
 he has kept me in dark places like those who have been long dead
 he has put a wall round me so that i am not able to go out he has made great the weight of my chain
 even when i send up a cry for help he keeps my prayer shut out
 he has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways he has made my roads twisted
 he is like a bear waiting for me like a lion in secret places
 by him my ways have been turned on one side and i have been pulled in bits he has made me waste
 with his bow bent he has made me the mark for his arrows
 he has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body
 i have become the sport of all the peoples i am their song all the day
 he has made my life nothing but pain he has given me the bitter root in full measure
 by him my teeth have been broken with crushed stones and i am bent low in the dust
 my soul is sent far away from peace i have no more memory of good
 and i said my strength is cut off and my hope from the lord
 keep in mind my trouble and my wandering the bitter root and the poison
 my soul still keeps the memory of them and is bent down in me
 this i keep in mind and because of this i have hope
 it is through the lords love that we have not come to destruction because his mercies have no limit
 they are new every morning great is your good faith
 i said to myself the lord is my heritage and because of this i will have hope in him
 the lord is good to those who are waiting for him to the soul which is looking for him
 it is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the lord
 it is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young
 let him be seated by himself saying nothing because he has put it on him
 let him put his mouth in the dust if by chance there may be hope
 let his face be turned to him who gives him blows let him be full of shame
 for the lord does not give a man up for ever
 for though he sends grief still he will have pity in the full measure of his love
 for he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men
 in a mans crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth
 in his turning away the right of a man before the face of the most high
 in his doing wrong to a man in his cause the lord has no pleasure
 who is able to say a thing and give effect to it if it has not been ordered by the lord
 do not evil and good come from the mouth of the most high
 what protest may a living man make even a man about the punishment of his sin
 let us make search and put our ways to the test turning again to the lord
 lifting up our hearts with our hands to god in the heavens
 we have done wrong and gone against your law we have not had your forgiveness
 covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us cutting us off without pity
 covering yourself with a cloud so that prayer may not get through
 you have made us like waste and that for which there is no use among the peoples
 the mouths of all our haters are open wide against us
 fear and deep waters have come on us wasting and destruction
 rivers of water are running down from my eyes for the destruction of the daughter of my people
 my eyes are streaming without stopping they have no rest
 till the lords eye is turned on me till he sees my trouble from heaven
 the lord is unkind to my soul more than all the daughters of my town
 they who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if i was a bird
 they have put an end to my life in the prison stoning me with stones
 waters were flowing over my head i said i am cut off
 i was making prayer to your name o lord out of the lowest prison
 my voice came to you let not your ear be shut to my breathing to my cry
 you came near in the day when i made my prayer to you you said have no fear
 o lord you have taken up the cause of my soul you have made my life safe
 o lord you have seen my wrong be judge in my cause
 you have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me and all their designs against me
 their bitter words have come to your ears o lord and all their designs against me
 the lips of those who came up against me and their thoughts against me all the day
 take note of them when they are seated and when they get up i am their song
 you will give them their reward o lord answering to the work of their hands
 you will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them
 you will go after them in wrath and put an end to them from under the heavens of the lord
 how dark has the gold become  how changed the best gold  the stones of the holy place are dropping out at the top of every street
 the valued sons of zion whose price was the best gold are looked on as vessels of earth the work of the hands of the potter 
 even the beasts of the waste land have full breasts they give milk to their young ones the daughter of my people has become cruel like the ostriches in the waste land
 the tongue of the child at the breast is fixed to the roof of his mouth for need of drink the young children are crying out for bread and no man gives it to them
 those who were used to feasting on delicate food are wasted in the streets those who as children were dressed in purple are stretched out on the dust
 for the punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of sodom which was overturned suddenly without any hand falling on her
 her holy ones were cleaner than snow they were whiter than milk their bodies were redder than corals their form was as the sapphire
 their face is blacker than night in the streets no one has knowledge of them their skin is hanging on their bones they are dry they have become like wood
 those who have been put to the sword are better off than those whose death is caused by need of food for these come to death slowly burned up like the fruit of the field
 the hands of kind hearted women have been boiling their children they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people
 the lord has given full effect to his passion he has let loose his burning wrath he has made a fire in zion causing the destruction of its bases
 to the kings of the earth and to all the people of the world it did not seem possible that the attackers and the haters would go into the doors of jerusalem
 it is because of the sins of her prophets and the evil doing of her priests by whom the blood of the upright has been drained out in her
 they are wandering like blind men in the streets they are made unclean with blood so that their robes may not be touched by men
 away  unclean  they were crying out to them away  away  let there be no touching when they went away in flight and wandering men said among the nations there is no further resting place for them
 the face of the lord has sent them in all directions he will no longer take care of them they had no respect for the priests they gave no honour to the old men
 our eyes are still wasting away in looking for our false help we have been watching for a nation unable to give salvation
 they go after our steps so that we may not go in our streets our end is near our days are numbered for our end has come
 those who went after us were quicker than the eagles of the heaven driving us before them on the mountains waiting secretly for us in the waste land
 our breath of life he on whom the holy oil was put was taken in their holes of whom we said under his shade we will be living among the nations
 have joy and be glad o daughter of edom living in the land of uz the cup will be given to you in your turn and you will be overcome with wine and your shame will be seen
 the punishment of your evil doing is complete o daughter of zion never again will he take you away as a prisoner he will give you the reward of your evil doing o daughter of edom he will let your sin be uncovered
 keep in mind o lord what has come to us take note and see our shame
 our heritage is given up to men of strange lands our houses to those who are not our countrymen
 we are children without fathers our mothers are like widows
 we give money for a drink of water we get our wood for a price
 our attackers are on our necks overcome with weariness we have no rest
 we have given our hands to the egyptians and to the assyrians so that we might have enough bread
 our fathers were sinners and are dead and the weight of their evil doing is on us
 servants are ruling over us and there is no one to make us free from their hands
 we put our lives in danger to get our bread because of the sword of the waste land
 our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from need of food
 they took by force the women in zion the virgins in the towns of judah
 their hands put princes to death by hanging the faces of old men were not honoured
 the young men were crushing the grain and the boys were falling under the wood
 the old men are no longer seated in the doorway and the music of the young men has come to an end
 the joy of our hearts is ended our dancing is changed into sorrow
 the crown has been taken from our head sorrow is ours for we are sinners
 because of this our hearts are feeble for these things our eyes are dark
 because of the mountain of zion which is a waste jackals go over it
 you o lord are seated as king for ever the seat of your power is eternal
 why have we gone from your memory for ever why have you been turned away from us for so long
 make us come back to you o lord and let us be turned make our days new again as in the past
 but you have quite given us up you are full of wrath against us
 and the voice of the lord came to moses out of the tent of meeting saying
 give these orders to the children of israel when anyone of you makes an offering to the lord you are to take it from the cattle from the herd or from the flock
 if the offering is a burned offering of the herd let him give a male without a mark he is to give it at the door of the tent of meeting so that he may be pleasing to the lord
 and he is to put his hand on the head of the burned offering and it will be taken for him to take away his sin
 and the ox is to be put to death before the lord then aarons sons the priests are to take the blood and put some of it on and round the altar which is at the door of the tent of meeting
 and the burned offering is to be skinned and cut up into its parts
 and aarons sons the priests are to put fire on the altar and put the wood in order on the fire
 and aarons sons the priests are to put the parts the head and the fat in order on the wood which is on the fire on the altar
 but its inside parts and its legs are to be washed with water and it will all be burned on the altar by the priest for a burned offering an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the lord
 and if his offering is of the flock a burned offering of sheep or goats let him give a male without a mark
 and he is to put it to death on the north side of the altar before the lord and aarons sons the priests are to put some of the blood on and round the altar
 and the offering is to be cut into its parts with its head and its fat and the priest is to put them in order on the wood which is on the fire on the altar
 but the inside parts and the legs are to be washed with water and the priest will make an offering of all of it burning it on the altar it is a burned offering an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the lord
 and if his offering to the lord is a burned offering of birds then he is to make his offering of doves or of young pigeons
 and the priest is to take it to the altar and after its head has been twisted off it is to be burned on the altar and its blood drained out on the side of the altar
 and he is to take away its stomach with its feathers and put it down by the east side of the altar where the burned waste is put
 and let it be broken open at the wings but not cut in two and let it be burned on the altar by the priest on the wood which is on the fire it is a burned offering an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the lord
 and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took their vessels and put fire in them and perfume burning strange fire before the lord which he had not given them orders to do
 and fire came out from before the lord burning them up and causing their destruction before the lord
 then moses said to aaron this is what the lord said i will be holy in the eyes of all those who come near to me and i will be honoured before all the people and aaron said nothing
 and moses sent for mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the brother of aarons father and said to them come near and take your brothers away from before the holy place outside the tent circle
 so they came and took them in their coats outside the tent circle as moses had said
 and moses said to aaron and to eleazar and ithamar his sons do not let your hair be loose and give no signs of grief so that death may not overtake you and his wrath come on all the people but let there be weeping among your brothers and all the house of israel for this burning of the lords fire
 and do not go out from the door of the tent of meeting or death will come to you for the holy oil of the lord is on you and they did as moses said
 and the lord said to aaron
 take no wine or strong drink you or your sons with you when you go into the tent of meeting that it may not be the cause of death to you this is an order for ever through all your generations
 and make a division between the holy and the common and between the unclean and the clean
 teaching the children of israel all the laws which the lord has given them by the hand of moses
 and moses said to aaron and to eleazar and ithamar his sons who were still living take the rest of the meal offering from the offerings of the lord made by fire and take it for your food without leaven at the side of the altar for it is most holy
 it is to be for your food in a holy place because it is your right and your sons right from the offerings of the lord made by fire for so am i ordered
 and the breast which is waved and the leg which is lifted up on high you are to take as your food in a clean place you and your sons and your daughters with you for they are given to you as your right and your sons right from the peace offerings of the children of israel
 let them take the breast which is waved and the leg which is lifted up on high with the fat of the burned offering to be waved for a wave offering before the lord and this will be for you and for your sons with you for a right for ever as the lord has given orders
 and moses was looking for the goat of the sin offering but it was burned and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron who were still living saying
 why did you not make a meal of the sin offering in the holy place for it is most holy and he has given it to you so that the sin of the people may be put on it to take away their sin before the lord
 see its blood was not taken into the holy place certainly it was right for you to have taken it as food in the holy place as i gave orders
 and aaron said to moses you have seen that today they have made their sin offering and their burned offering before the lord and such things as these have come on me if i had taken the sin offering as food today would it have been pleasing to the lord
 and after hearing this moses was no longer angry
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 say to the children of israel these are the living things which you may have for food among all the beasts on the earth
 you may have as food any beast which has a division in the horn of its foot and whose food comes back into its mouth to be crushed again
 but at the same time of those beasts you may not take for food the camel because its food comes back but the horn of its foot is not parted in two it is unclean to you
 and the rock badger for the same reason is unclean to you
 and the hare because the horn of its foot is not parted in two is unclean to you
 and the pig is unclean to you because though the horn of its foot is parted its food does not come back
 their flesh may not be used for food and their dead bodies may not even be touched they are unclean to you
 these you may have for food of all things living in the water anything living in the water in the seas or rivers which has special parts for swimming and skin formed of thin plates may be used for food
 all other things living and moving in the water in the sea or in the rivers are a disgusting thing to you
 they may not be used for food and their dead bodies are disgusting to you
 anything in the water which has no special parts for swimming and no thin plates on its skin is disgusting to you
 and among birds these are to be disgusting to you and not to be used for food the eagle and the gier eagle and the ospray
 and the kite and the falcon and birds of that sort
 every raven and birds of that sort
 and the ostrich and the night hawk and the sea hawk and birds of that sort
 and the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl
 and the water hen and the pelican and the vulture
 the stork and the heron and birds of that sort and the hoopoe and the bat
 every winged four footed thing which goes on the earth is disgusting to you
 but of the winged four footed things those which have long legs for jumping on the earth you may have for food
 such as all the different sorts of locust
 but all other winged four footed things which go on the earth are disgusting to you
 by these you will be made unclean anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean till evening
 whoever takes away the dead body of one of them is to have his clothing washed and will be unclean till evening
 every beast in the horn of whose foot there is not a complete division and whose food does not come back is unclean to you anyone touching one of these will be unclean
 any four footed beast which goes on the ball of its foot is unclean to you anyone touching the dead body of one of these will be unclean till evening
 anyone who takes away the dead body of one of these is to have his clothing washed and be unclean till evening
 and these are unclean to you among things which go low down on the earth the weasel and the mouse and the great lizard and animals of that sort
 and the ferret and the land crocodile and the lizard and the sand lizard and the chameleon
 all these are unclean to you anyone touching them when they are dead will be unclean till evening
 the dead body of any of these falling on anything will make that thing unclean if it is any vessel of wood or clothing or skin or bag whatever it is if it is used for any purpose it will have to be put into water and will be unclean till evening after that it will be clean
 and if one of them gets into any vessel of earth whatever is in the vessel will be unclean and the vessel will have to be broken
 any food in it and anything on which water from it comes will be unclean any drink taken from such a vessel will be unclean
 any part of the dead body of one of these falling on anything will make it unclean if it is an oven or a cooking pot it will have to be broken they are unclean and will be unclean to you
 but at the same time a fountain or a place where water is stored for use will be clean but anyone touching their dead bodies will be unclean
 if any part of the dead body of one of these gets on to any seed for planting it is clean
 but if water is put on the seed and any part of the dead body gets on to it it will be unclean to you
 and if any beast which may be used for food comes to a natural death anyone touching its dead body will be unclean till evening
 and he who makes use of any part of its body for food is to have his clothing washed and be unclean till evening and anyone taking away its body is to have his clothing washed and be unclean till evening
 everything which goes flat on its body on the earth is disgusting and is not to be used for food
 whatever goes on its stomach or on four feet or has a great number of feet even all those going flat on the earth may not be used for food for they are disgusting
 you are not to make yourselves disgusting with anything which goes about flat on the earth you may not make yourselves unclean with them in such a way that you are not holy to me
 for i am the lord your god for this reason make and keep yourselves holy for i am holy you are not to make yourselves unclean with any sort of thing which goes about flat on the earth
 for i am the lord who took you out of the land of egypt to be your god so be you holy for i am holy
 this is the law about beasts and birds and every living thing moving in the waters and every living thing which goes flat on the earth
 marking out the unclean from the clean and the living thing which may be used for food from that which may not
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if a woman is with child and gives birth to a male child she will be unclean for seven days as when she is unwell

 and aaron is to give the ox of the sin offering for himself and take away sin from himself and his house and put to death the ox of the sin offering which is for himself
 and he is to take a vessel full of burning coal from the altar before the lord and in his hand some sweet perfume crushed small and take it inside the veil

 and let him take some of the blood of the ox shaking drops of it from his finger on the cover of the ark on the east side and before it seven times
 then let him put to death the goat of the sin offering for the people and take its blood inside the veil and do with it as he did with the blood of the ox shaking drops of it on and before the cover of the ark
 and let him make the holy place free from whatever is unclean among the children of israel and from their wrongdoing in all their sins and let him do the same for the tent of meeting which has its place among an unclean people
 and no man may be in the tent of meeting from the time when aaron goes in to take away sin in the holy place till he comes out having made himself and his house and all the people of israel free from sin
 and he is to go out to the altar which is before the lord and make it free from sin and he is to take some of the blood of the ox and the blood of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar and round it
 shaking drops of the blood from his finger on it seven times to make it holy and clean from whatever is unclean among the children of israel

 and let this be an order for ever for you so that the sin of the children of israel may be taken away once every year and he did as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron and to his sons and to all the children of israel this is the order which the lord has given
 if any man of israel puts to death an ox or a lamb or a goat in or outside the tent circle
 and has not taken it to the door of the tent of meeting to make an offering to the lord before the lords house its blood will be on him for he has taken life and he will be cut off from among his people
 so that the children of israel may take to the lord to the door of the tent of meeting and to the priest the offerings which they have put to death in the open country and that they may make their peace offerings to the lord
 and the priest will put blood on the altar of the lord at the door of the tent of meeting burning the fat for a sweet smell to the lord
 and let them make no more offerings to evil spirits after which they have gone turning away from the lord let this be a law to them for ever through all their generations
 and say to them if any man of israel or any other living among them makes a burned offering or other offering
 and does not take it to the door of the tent of meeting to make an offering to the lord that man will be cut off from among his people
 and if any man of israel or any other living among them takes any sort of blood for food my wrath will be turned against that man and he will be cut off from among his people
 for the life of the flesh is in its blood and i have given it to you on the altar to take away your sin for it is the blood which makes free from sin because of the life in it
 for this reason i have said to the children of israel no man among you or any others living with you may take blood as food
 and any man of israel or any other living among them who gets with his bow any beast or bird used for food is to see that its blood is covered with earth
 for the blood is the life of all flesh and so i have said to the children of israel you may not take any sort of blood as food and any man who does so will be cut of
 and anyone who takes as food anything which has come to a natural end or anything which has been put to death by beasts if he is one of you by birth or of another nation will have to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and be unclean till evening and then he will be clean
 but if his clothing is not washed and his body bathed his sin will be on him
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel i am the lord your god
 you may not do those things which were done in the land of egypt where you were living and you may not do those things which are done in the land of canaan where i am taking you or be guided in your behaviour by their rules
 but you are to be guided by my decisions and keep my rules and be guided by them i am the lord your god
 so keep my rules and my decisions which if a man does them will be life to him i am the lord

 and you may not have sex relations with your fathers wife she is your fathers
 you may not take your sister the daughter of your father or of your mother wherever her birth took place among you or in another country

 and you may not have sex relations with a beast making yourself unclean with it and a woman may not give herself to a beast it is an unnatural act
 do not make yourself unclean in any of these ways for so have those nations whom i am driving out from before you made themselves unclean
 and the land itself has become unclean so that i have sent on it the reward of its wrongdoing and the land itself puts out those who are living in it
 so then keep my rules and my decisions and do not do any of these disgusting things those of you who are israelites by birth or any others who are living with you
  for all these disgusting things were done by the men of this country who were there before you and the land has been made unclean by them 
 so that the land may not put you out from it when you make it unclean as it put out the nations which were there before you
 for all those who do any of these disgusting things will be cut off from among their people
 so then keep my orders so that you may not do any of these disgusting things which were done before you or make yourselves unclean through them i am the lord your god
 and the lord said to moses
 say to all the people of israel you are to be holy for i the lord your god am holy
 let every man give honour to his mother and to his father and keep my sabbaths i am the lord your god
 do not go after false gods and do not make metal images of gods for yourselves i am the lord your god
 and when you give a peace offering to the lord do it in the way which is pleasing to the lord
 let it be used for food on the same day on which it is offered or on the day after and whatever is over on the third day is to be burned with fire

 but i have said to you you will take their land and i will give it to you for your heritage a land flowing with milk and honey i am the lord your god who have made you separate from all other peoples

 but only for his near relations for his mother or his father his son or his daughter and his brother
 and for his sister a virgin for she is his near relation and has had no husband he may make himself unclean
 but let him being a chief among his people not make himself unclean in such a way as to put shame on himself
 they are not to have their hair cut off for the dead or the hair on their chins cut short or make cuts in their flesh

 a widow or one whose husband has put her away or a common woman of loose behaviour may not be the wife of a priest but let him take a virgin from among his people
 and he may not make his seed unclean among his people for i the lord have made him holy
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron if a man of your family in any generation is damaged in body let him not come near to make the offering of the bread of his god
 for any man whose body is damaged may not come near one who is blind or has not the use of his legs or one who has a broken nose or any unnatural growth
 or a man with broken feet or hands
 or one whose back is bent or one who is unnaturally small or one who has a damaged eye or whose skin is diseased or whose sex parts are damaged

 he may take of the bread of god the holy and the most holy
 but he may not go inside the veil or come near the altar because he is damaged and he may not make my holy places common for i the lord have made them holy
 these are the words which moses said to aaron and to his sons and to all the children of israel
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to aaron and to his sons to keep themselves separate from the holy things of the children of israel which they give to me and not to make my holy name common i am the lord
 say to them if any man of all your seed through all your generations being unclean comes near the holy things which the children of israel make holy to the lord he will be cut off from before me i am the lord
 no man of the seed of aaron who is a leper or who has a flow from his body may take of the holy food till he is clean and any man touching anything which is unclean because of the dead or any man whose seed goes from him
 or anyone touching any unclean thing which goes flat on the earth or someone by whom he may be made unclean in any way whatever
 any person touching any such unclean thing will be unclean till evening and may not take of the holy food till his flesh has been bathed in water
 and when the sun has gone down he will be clean and after that he may take part in the holy food because it is his bread
 that which comes to a natural death or is attacked by beasts he may not take as food for it will make him unclean i am the lord
 so then let them keep what i have put into their care for fear that sin may come on them because of it so causing their death because they have made it common i am the lord who make them holy
 no outside person may take of the holy food or one living as a guest in the priests house or a servant working for payment
 but any person for whom the priest has given money to make him his may take of it with him and those who come to birth in his house may take of his bread
 and if the daughter of a priest is married to an outside person she may not take of the holy things which are lifted up as offerings
 but if a priests daughter is a widow or parted from her husband and has no child and has come back to her fathers house as when she was a girl she may take of her fathers bread but no outside person may do so
 and if a man takes the holy food in error he will have to give the holy thing back to the priest with the addition of a fifth part
 and they may not make common the holy things which the children of israel give to the lord
 so causing sin to come on them when they take their holy things for food i am the lord who make them holy
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron and to his sons and to all the children of israel if any man of the children of israel or of another nation living in israel makes an offering given because of an oath or freely given to the lord for a burned offering
 so that it may be pleasing to the lord let him give a male without any mark from among the oxen or the sheep or the goats

 and do not make my holy name common so that it may be kept holy by the children of israel i am the lord who make you holy

 so that future generations may keep in mind how i gave the children of israel tents as their living places when i took them out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
 and moses made clear to the children of israel the orders about the fixed feasts of the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to the children of israel to give you clean olive oil for the light so that a light may be burning at all times
 outside the veil of the ark in the tent of meeting let aaron see that it is burning from evening till morning at all times before the lord it is a rule for ever through all your generations
 let aaron put the lights in order on the support before the lord at all times

 and it will be for aaron and his sons they are to take it for food in a holy place it is the most holy of all the offerings made by fire to the lord a rule for ever
 and a son of an israelite woman whose father was an egyptian went out among the children of israel and had a fight with a man of israel by the tents
 and the son of the israelite woman said evil against the holy name with curses and they took him to moses his mothers name was shelomith the daughter of dibri of the tribe of dan
 and they kept him shut up till a decision might be given by the mouth of the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 take the curser outside the tent circle and let all in whose hearing the words were said put their hands on his head and let him be stoned by all the people
 and say to the children of israel as for any man cursing god his sin will be on his head
 and he who says evil against the name of the lord will certainly be put to death he will be stoned by all the people the man who is not of your nation and one who is an israelite by birth whoever says evil against the holy name is to be put to death
 and anyone who takes anothers life is certainly to be put to death
 and anyone wounding a beast and causing its death will have to make payment for it a life for a life
 and if a man does damage to his neighbour as he has done so let it be done to him
 wound for wound eye for eye tooth for tooth whatever damage he has done so let it be done to him
 he who puts a beast to death will have to make payment for it he who puts a man to death will himself be put to death
 you are to have the same law for a man of another nation living among you as for an israelite for i am the lord your god
 and moses said these words to the children of israel and they took the man who had been cursing outside the tent circle and had him stoned the children of israel did as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses on mount sinai
 say to the children of israel when you come into the land which i will give you let the land keep a sabbath to the lord
 for six years put seed into your land and for six years give care to your vines and get in the produce of them
 but let the seventh year be a sabbath of rest for the land a sabbath to the lord do not put seed into your land or have your vines cut
 that which comes to growth of itself may not be cut and the grapes of your uncared for vines may not be taken off let it be a year of rest for the land
 and the sabbath of the land will give food for you and your man servant and your woman servant and those working for payment and for those of another country who are living among you
 and for your cattle and the beasts on the land all the natural increase of the land will be for food
 and let seven sabbaths of years be numbered to you seven times seven years even the days of seven sabbaths of years that is forty nine years
 then let the loud horn be sounded far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month on the day of taking away sin let the horn be sounded through all your land
 and let this fiftieth year be kept holy and say publicly that everyone in the land is free from debt it is the jubilee and every man may go back to his heritage and to his family
 let this fiftieth year be the jubilee no seed may be planted and that which comes to growth of itself may not be cut and the grapes may not be taken from the uncared for vines
 for it is the jubilee and it is holy to you your food will be the natural increase of the field
 in this year of jubilee let every man go back to his heritage
 and in the business of trading goods for money do no wrong to one another
 let your exchange of goods with your neighbours have relation to the number of years after the year of jubilee and the number of times the earth has given her produce
 if the number of years is great the price will be increased and if the number of years is small the price will be less for it is the produce of a certain number of years which the man is giving you
 and do no wrong one to another but let the fear of your god be before you for i am the lord your god
 so keep my rules and my decisions and do them and you will be safe in your land
 and the land will give her fruit and you will have food in full measure and be safe in the land
 and if you say where will our food come from in the seventh year when we may not put in seed or get in the increase
 then i will send my blessing on you in the sixth year and the land will give fruit enough for three years
 and in the eighth year you will put in your seed and get your food from the old stores till the fruit of the ninth year is ready
 no exchange of land may be for ever for the land is mine and you are as my guests living with me for a time
 wherever there is property in land the owner is to have the right of getting it back
 if your brother becomes poor and has to give up some of his land for money his nearest relation may come and get back that which his brother has given up
 and if he has no one to get it back for him and later he himself gets wealth and has enough money to get it back
 then let him take into account the years from the time when he gave it up and make up the loss for the rest of the years to him who took it and so get back his property
 but if he is not able to get it back for himself then it will be kept by him who gave a price for it till the year of jubilee and in that year it will go back to its first owner and he will have his property again
 and if a man gives his house in a walled town for money he has the right to get it back for the space of a full year after he has given it up
 and if he does not get it back by the end of the year then the house in the town will become the property of him who gave the money for it and of his children for ever it will not go from him in the year of jubilee
 but houses in small unwalled towns will be the same as property in the country they may be got back and they will go back to their owners in the year of jubilee
 but the houses in the towns of the levites may be got back by the levites at any time
 and if a levite does not give money to get back his property his house in the town which was exchanged for money will come back to him in the year of jubilee for the houses of the towns of the levites are their property among the children of israel
 but the land on the outskirts of their towns may not be exchanged for money for it is their property for ever
 and if your brother becomes poor and is not able to make a living then you are to keep him with you helping him as you would a man from another country who is living among you
 take no interest from him in money or in goods but have the fear of your god before you and let your brother make a living among you
 do not take interest on the money which you let him have or on the food which you give him
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan that i might be your god
 and if your brother becomes poor and gives himself to you for money do not make use of him like a servant who is your property
 but let him be with you as a servant working for payment till the year of jubilee
 then he will go out from you he and his children with him and go back to his family and to the property of his fathers
 for they are my servants whom i took out from the land of egypt they may not become the property of another
 do not be a hard master to him but have the fear of god before you
 but you may get servants as property from among the nations round about from them you may take men servants and women servants
 and in addition you may get for money servants from among the children of other nations who are living with you and from their families which have come to birth in your land and these will be your property
 and they will be your childrens heritage after you to keep as their property they will be your servants for ever but you may not be hard masters to your countrymen the children of israel
 and if one from another nation living among you gets wealth and your countryman at his side becomes poor and gives himself for money to the man from another nation or to one of his family
 after he has given himself he has the right to be made free for a price by one of his brothers
 or his fathers brother or the son of his fathers brother or any near relation or if he gets money he may make himself free
 and let the years be numbered from the time when he gave himself to his owner till the year of jubilee and the price given for him will be in relation to the number of years on the scale of the payment of a servant
 if there is still a long time he will give back on account of it a part of the price which was given for him
 and if there is only a short time he will take account of it with his master and in relation to the number of years he will give back the price of making him free
 and he will be with him as a servant working for payment year by year his master is not to be cruel to him before your eyes
 and if he is not made free in this way he will go out in the year of jubilee he and his children with him
 for the children of israel are servants to me they are my servants whom i took out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god
 do not make images of false gods or put up an image cut in stone or a pillar or any pictured stone in your land to give worship to it for i am the lord your god
 keep my sabbaths and give honour to my holy place i am the lord
 if you are guided by my rules and keep my laws and do them

 in the year of jubilee the field will go back to him from whom he got it that is to him whose heritage it was
 and let all your values be based on the shekel of the holy place that is twenty gerahs to the shekel

 and if it is an unclean beast then the owner of it may give money to get it back in agreement with the value fixed by you by giving a fifth more or if it is not taken back let it be given for money in agreement with your valuing

 and moses took some of the holy oil and of the blood which was on the altar and put it on aaron and on his robes and on his sons and on his sons robes and made aaron holy and his robes and his sons and his sons robes with him
 and moses said to aaron and to his sons the flesh is to be cooked in water at the door of the tent of meeting and there you are to take it as food together with the bread in the basket as i have given orders saying it is the food of aaron and his sons
 and that which is over of the flesh and of the bread is to be burned with fire
 and you are not to go out from the door of the tent of meeting for seven days till the days for making you priest are ended for this will be the work of seven days
 what has been done this day has been ordered by the lord to take away your sin
 and you are to keep watch for the lord at the door of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days so that death may not come to you for so he has given me orders
 and aaron and his sons did all the things about which the lord had given orders through moses
 and on the eighth day moses sent for aaron and his sons and the responsible men of israel
 and he said to aaron take a young ox for a sin offering and a male sheep for a burned offering without a mark and make an offering of them before the lord
 and say to the children of israel take a he goat for a sin offering and a young ox and a lamb in their first year without any mark on them for a burned offering
 and an ox and a male sheep for peace offerings to be put to death before the lord and a meal offering mixed with oil for this day you are to see the lord
 and they took the things ordered by moses before the tent of meeting and all the people came near waiting before the lord
 and moses said this is what the lord has said you are to do and you will see the glory of the lord
 and moses said to aaron come near to the altar and make your sin offering and your burned offering to take away your sin and the sin of the people and make the peoples offering to take away their sin as the lord has given orders
 so aaron came near to the altar and put to death the ox for the sin offering for himself
 and the sons of aaron gave him the blood and he put his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar draining out the blood at the base of the altar
 but the fat and the kidneys and the fat on the liver of the sin offering were burned by him on the altar as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the flesh and the skin were burned with fire outside the tent circle
 and he put to death the burned offering and aarons sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar
 and they gave him the parts of the burned offering in their order and the head to be burned on the altar
 and the inside parts and the legs when they had been washed with water were burned on the burned offering on the altar
 and he made an offering for the people and took the goat of the sin offering for the people and put it to death offering it for sin in the same way as the first
 and he took the burned offering offering it in the ordered way
 and he put the meal offering before the lord and taking some of it in his hand he had it burned on the altar separately from the burned offering of the morning
 and he put to death the ox and the sheep which were the peace offerings for the people and aarons sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar
 and as for the fat of the ox and the fat tail of the sheep and the fat covering the inside parts and the kidneys and the fat on the liver
 they put the fat on the breasts and the fat was burned on the altar
 and aaron took the breasts and the right leg waving them for a wave offering before the lord as moses gave orders
 and aaron lifting up his hands to the people gave them a blessing and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burned offering and the peace offerings
 and moses and aaron went into the tent of meeting and came out and gave the people a blessing and the glory of the lord was seen by all the people
 and fire came out from before the lord burning up the offering on the altar and the fat and when all the people saw it they gave a loud cry falling down on their faces
 the word of the lord to israel by malachi
 you have been loved by me says the lord but you say where was your love for us was not esau jacobs brother says the lord but jacob was loved by me
 and esau was hated and i sent destruction on his mountains and gave his heritage to the beasts of the waste land
 though edom says we are crushed down but we will come back building up the waste places this is what the lord of armies has said they may put up buildings but i will have them pulled down and they will be named the land of evil doing and the people against whom the lord keeps his wrath for ever
 and your eyes will see it and you will say the lord is great even outside the limits of israel
 a son gives honour to his father and a servant has fear of his master if then i am a father where is my honour and if i am a master where is the fear of me says the lord of armies to you o priests who give no value to my name and you say how have we not given value to your name
 you put unclean bread on my altar and you say how have we made it unclean by your saying the table of the lord is of no value
 and when you give what is blind for an offering it is no evil  and when you give what is damaged and ill it is no evil  give it now to your ruler will he be pleased with you or will you have his approval says the lord of armies
 and now make request for the grace of god so that he may have mercy on us this has been your doing will he give his approval to any of you says the lord of armies
 if only there was one among you who would see that the doors were shut so that you might not put a light to the fire on my altar for nothing  i have no pleasure in you says the lord of armies and i will not take an offering from your hands
 for from the coming up of the sun till its going down my name is great among the gentiles and in every place the smell of burning flesh is offered to my name and a clean offering for my name is great among the gentiles says the lord of armies
 but you make it unholy by saying the lords table has become unclean and his food is of no value
 and you say see what a weariness it is  and you let out your breath at it says the lord of armies and you have given what has been cut about by beasts and what is damaged in its feet and ill this is the offering you give will this be pleasing to me from your hands says the lord
 a curse on the false man who has a male in his flock and takes his oath and gives to the lord a damaged thing for i am a great king says the lord of armies and my name is to be feared among the gentiles
 and now o you priests this order is for you
 if you will not give ear and take it to heart to give glory to my name says the lord of armies then i will send the curse on you and will put a curse on your blessing truly even now i have put a curse on it because you do not take it to heart
 see i will have your arm cut off and will put waste on your faces even the waste from your feasts and you will be taken away with it
 and you will be certain that i have sent this order to you so that it might be my agreement with levi says the lord of armies
 my agreement with him was on my side life and peace and i gave them to him on his side fear and he had fear of me and gave honour to my name
 true teaching was in his mouth and no evil was seen on his lips he was walking with me in peace and righteousness turning numbers of people away from evil doing
 for it is right for the priests lips to keep knowledge and for men to be waiting for the law from his mouth for he is the servant sent from the lord of armies
 but you are turned out of the way you have made the law hard for numbers of people you have made the agreement of levi of no value says the lord of armies
 and so i have taken away your honour and made you low before all the people even as you have not kept my ways and have given no thought to me in using the law
 have we not all one father has not one god made us why are we every one of us acting falsely to his brother putting shame on the agreement of our fathers
 judah has been acting falsely and a disgusting thing has been done in jerusalem for judah has made unclean the holy place of the lord which is dear to him and has taken as his wife the daughter of a strange god
 the lord will have the man who does this cut off root and branch out of the tents of jacob and him who makes an offering to the lord of armies
 and this again you do covering the altar of the lord with weeping and with grief so that he gives no more thought to the offering and does not take it with pleasure from your hand
 but you say for what reason because the lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your early years to whom you have been untrue though she is your friend and the wife to whom you have given your word
  so give thought to your spirit and let no one be false to the wife of his early years
 for i am against the putting away of a wife says the lord the god of israel and against him who is clothed with violent acts says the lord of armies so give thought to your spirit and do not be false in your acts
 you have made the lord tired with your words and still you say how have we made him tired by your saying everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of the lord and he has delight in them or where is god the judge
 see i am sending my servant and he will make ready the way before me and the lord whom you are looking for will suddenly come to his temple and the angel of the agreement in whom you have delight see he is coming says the lord of armies
 but by whom may the day of his coming be faced and who may keep his place when he is seen for he is like the metal testers fire and the cleaners soap
 he will take his seat testing and cleaning the sons of levi burning away the evil from them as from gold and silver so that they may make offerings to the lord in righteousness
 then the offering of judah and jerusalem will be pleasing to the lord as in days gone by and as in past years
 and i will come near to you for judging i will quickly be a witness against the wonder workers against those who have been untrue in married life against those who take false oaths against those who keep back from the servant his payment and who are hard on the widow and the child without a father who do not give his rights to the man from a strange country and have no fear of me says the lord of armies
 for i am the lord i am unchanged and so you o sons of jacob have not been cut off
 from the days of your fathers you have been turned away from my rules and have not kept them come back to me and i will come back to you says the lord of armies but you say how are we to come back
 will a man keep back from god what is right but you have kept back what is mine but you say what have we kept back from you tenths and offerings
 you are cursed with a curse for you have kept back from me what is mine even all this nation
 let your tenths come into the store house so that there may be food in my house and put me to the test by doing so says the lord of armies and see if i do not make the windows of heaven open and send down such a blessing on you that there is no room for it
 and on your account i will keep back the locusts from wasting the fruits of your land and the fruit of your vine will not be dropped on the field before its time says the lord of armies
 and you will be named happy by all nations for you will be a land of delight says the lord of armies
 your words have been strong against me says the lord and still you say what have we said against you
 you have said it is no use worshipping god what profit have we had from keeping his orders and going in clothing of sorrow before the lord of armies
 and now to us the men of pride seem happy yes the evil doers are doing well they put god to the test and are safe
 then those in whom was the fear of the lord had talk together and the lord gave ear and it was recorded in a book to be kept in mind before him for those who had the fear of the lord and gave thought to his name
 and they will be mine says the lord in the day when i make them my special property and i will have mercy on them as a man has mercy on his son who is his servant
 then you will again see how the upright man is different from the sinner and the servant of god from him who is not
 for see the day is coming it is burning like an oven all the men of pride and all who do evil will be dry stems of grass and in the day which is coming they will be burned up says the lord of armies till they have not a root or a branch
 but to you who give worship to my name the sun of righteousness will come up with new life in its wings and you will go out playing like young oxen full of food
 and the evil doers will be crushed under you they will be dust under your feet in the day when i do my work says the lord of armies
 keep in mind the law of moses my servant which i gave him in horeb for all israel even the rules and the decisions
 see i am sending you elijah the prophet before the day of the lord comes that great day greatly to be feared
 and by him the hearts of fathers will be turned to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers for fear that i may come and put the earth under a curse
 the word of the lord which came to micah the morashtite in the days of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah his vision about samaria and jerusalem
 give ear you peoples all of you give attention o earth and everything in it let the lord god be witness against you the lord from his holy temple
 for see the lord is coming out from his place and will come down stepping on the high places of the earth
 and the mountains will be turned to water under him and the deep valleys will be broken open like wax before the fire like waters flowing down a slope
 all this is because of the wrongdoing of jacob and the sins of the children of israel what is the wrongdoing of jacob is it not samaria and what are the high places of judah are they not jerusalem
 so i will make samaria into a field and the plantings of a vine garden i will send its stones falling down into the valley uncovering its bases
 and all her pictured images will be hammered into bits and all the payments for her loose ways will be burned with fire and all the images of her gods i will make waste for with the price of a loose woman she got them together and as the price of a loose woman will they be given back
 for this i will be full of sorrow and give cries of grief i will go uncovered and unclothed i will give cries of grief like the jackals and will be in sorrow like the ostriches
 for her wounds may not be made well for it has come even to judah stretching up to the doorway of my people even to jerusalem
 give no word of it in gath let there be no weeping at all at beth le aphrah be rolling in the dust
 be uncovered and go away you who are living in shaphir the one living in zaanan has not come out of her town beth ezel is taken away from its base even from its resting place
 for the one living in maroth is waiting for good for evil has come down from the lord to the doorways of jerusalem
 let the war carriage be yoked to the quick running horse you who are living in lachish she was the first cause of sin to the daughter of zion for the wrongdoings of israel were seen in you
 for this cause give a parting offering to moresheth gath the daughter of achzib will be a deceit to the king of israel
 even now will the taker of your heritage come to you you who are living in mareshah the glory of israel will come to destruction for ever
 let your head be uncovered and your hair cut off in sorrow for the children of your delight let the hair be pulled from your head like an eagles for they have been taken away from you as prisoners
 a curse on the designers of evil working on their beds  in the morning light they do it because it is in their power
 they have a desire for fields and take them by force and for houses and take them away they are cruel to a man and his family even to a man and his heritage
 for this cause the lord has said see against this family i am purposing an evil from which you will not be able to take your necks away and you will be weighted down by it for it is an evil time
 in that day this saying will be said about you and this song of grief will be made the heritage of my people is measured out and there is no one to give it back those who have made us prisoners have taken our fields from us and complete destruction has come to us
 for this cause you will have no one to make the decision by the measuring line in the meeting of the lord
 let not words like these be dropped they say shame and the curse will not come to the family of jacob 
 is the lord quickly made angry are these his doings do not his words do good to his people israel
 as for you you have become haters of those who were at peace with you you take the clothing of those who go by without fear and make them prisoners of war
 the women of my people you have been driving away from their dearly loved children from their young ones you are taking my glory for ever
 up  and go for this is not your rest because it has been made unclean the destruction ordered will come on you
 if a man came with a false spirit of deceit saying i will be a prophet to you of wine and strong drink he would be the sort of prophet for this people
 i will certainly make all of you o jacob come together i will get together the rest of israel i will put them together like the sheep in their circle like a flock in their green field they will be full of the noise of men
 the opener of the way will go up before them forcing their way out they will go on to the doorway and out through it their king will go on before them and the lord at their head
 and i said give ear now you heads of jacob and rulers of the people of israel is it not for you to have knowledge of what is right
 you who are haters of good and lovers of evil pulling off their skin from them and their flesh from their bones
 like meat they take the flesh of my people for their food skinning them and crushing their bones yes cutting them up as if for the pot like flesh inside the cooking pot
 then they will be crying to the lord for help but he will not give them an answer yes he will keep his face veiled from them at that time because their acts have been evil
 this is what the lord has said about the prophets by whom my people have been turned from the right way who biting with their teeth say peace and if anyone puts nothing in their mouths they make ready for war against him
 for this cause it will be night for you without a vision and it will be dark for you without knowledge of the future the sun will go down over the prophets and the day will be black over them
 and the seers will be shamed and the readers of the future will be at a loss all of them covering their lips for there is no answer from god
 but i truly am full of the spirit of the lord with power of judging and with strength to make clear to jacob his wrongdoing and to israel his sin
 then give ear to this you heads of the children of jacob you rulers of the children of israel hating what is right twisting what is straight
 they are building up zion with blood and jerusalem with evil doing
 its heads take rewards for judging and the priests take payment for teaching and the prophets get silver for reading the future but still supporting themselves on the lord they say is not the lord among us no evil will overtake us
 for this reason zion will be ploughed like a field because of you and jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls and the mountain of the house like a high place in the woods
 but in the last days it will come about that the mountain of the lords house will be placed on the top of the mountains and be lifted up over the hills and peoples will be flowing to it
 and a number of nations will go and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the lord and to the house of the god of jacob and he will give us knowledge of his ways and we will be guided by his word for from zion the law will go out and the word of the lord from jerusalem
 and he will be judge between great peoples and strong nations far away will be ruled by his decisions their swords will be hammered into plough blades and their spears into vine knives nations will no longer be lifting up their swords against one another and knowledge of war will have gone for ever
 but every man will be seated under his vine and under his fig tree and no one will be a cause of fear to them for the mouth of the lord of armies has said it
 for all the peoples will be walking every one in the name of his god and we will be walking in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever
 in that day says the lord i will get together her who goes with uncertain steps i will get together her who has been sent away and her on whom i have sent evil
 and i will make her whose steps were uncertain a small band and her who was feeble a strong nation and the lord will be their king in mount zion from now and for ever
 and you o tower of the flock ophel of the daughter of zion to you it will come even the earlier authority the kingdom of the daughter of jerusalem
 now why are you crying so loudly is there no king in you has destruction come on your wise helper so that pains have taken you like the pains of a woman in childbirth
 be in pain make sounds of grief o daughter of zion like a woman in childbirth for now you will go out of the town living in the open country and will come even to babylon there you will have salvation there the lord will make you free from the hands of your haters
 and now a number of nations have come together against you and they say let her be made unclean and let our eyes see the fate of zion
 but they have no knowledge of the thoughts of the lord their minds are not able to see his purpose for he has got them together like stems of grain to the crushing floor
 up  and let the grain be crushed o daughter of zion for i will make your horn iron and your feet brass and a number of peoples will be broken by you and you will give up their increase to the lord and their wealth to the lord of all the earth
 now you will give yourselves deep wounds for grief they will put up a wall round us they will give the judge of israel a blow on the face with a rod
 and you beth lehem ephrathah the least among the families of judah out of you one will come to me who is to be ruler in israel whose going out has been purposed from time past from the eternal days
 for this cause he will give them up till the time when she who is with child has given birth then the rest of his brothers will come back to the children of israel
 and he will take his place and give food to his flock in the strength of the lord in the glory of the name of the lord his god and their resting place will be safe for now he will be great to the ends of the earth
 and this will be our peace when the assyrian comes into our country and his feet are in our land then we will put up against him seven keepers of the flocks and eight chiefs among men
 and they will make waste the land of assyria with the sword and the land of nimrod with the edge of the sword he will give us salvation from the assyrian when he comes into our country when his feet come inside the limit of our land
 and the rest of jacob will be among the mass of peoples like dew from the lord like showers on the grass which may not be kept back by man or be waiting for the sons of men
 and the rest of jacob will be among the nations in the middle of the mass of peoples like a lion among the beasts of the woods like a young lion among the flocks of sheep if he goes through they will be crushed under foot and pulled to bits and there will be no saviour
 your hand is lifted up against those who are against you and all your haters will be cut off
 and it will come about in that day says the lord that i will take away your horses from you and will give your war carriages to destruction
 i will have the towns of your land cut off and all your strong places pulled down
 i will put an end to your use of secret arts and you will have no more readers of signs
 and i will have your images and your pillars cut off from you and you will no longer give worship to the work of your hands
 i will have your asherahs pulled up from among you and i will send destruction on your images
 and my punishment will be effected on the nations with such burning wrath as they have not had word of
 give ear now to the words of the lord up  put forward your cause before the mountains let your voice be sounding among the hills
 give ear o you mountains to the lords cause and take note you bases of the earth for the lord has a cause against his people and he will take it up with israel
 o my people what have i done to you how have i been a weariness to you give answer against me
 for i took you up out of the land of egypt and made you free from the prison house i sent before you moses aaron and miriam
 o my people keep in mind now what was designed by balak king of moab and the answer which balaam son of beor gave him the events from shittim to gilgal so that you may be certain of the upright acts of the lord
 with what am i to come before the lord and go with bent head before the high god am i to come before him with burned offerings with young oxen a year old
 will the lord be pleased with thousands of sheep or with ten thousand rivers of oil am i to give my first child for my wrongdoing the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul
 he has made clear to you o man what is good and what is desired from you by the lord only doing what is right and loving mercy and walking without pride before your god
 the voice of the lord is crying out to the town give ear you tribes and the meeting of the town
 am i to let the stores of the evil doer go out of my memory and the short measure which is cursed
 is it possible for me to let wrong scales and the bag of false weights go without punishment
 for its men of wealth are cruel and its people have said what is not true and their tongue is false in their mouth
 so i have made a start with your punishment i have made you waste because of your sins
 you will have food but not enough your shame will be ever with you you will get your goods moved but you will not take them away safely and what you do take away i will give to the sword
 you will put in seed but you will not get in the grain you will be crushing olives but your bodies will not be rubbed with the oil and you will get in the grapes but you will have no wine
 for you have kept the laws of omri and all the works of the family of ahab and you have been guided by their designs so that i might make you a cause of wonder and your people a cause of hisses and the shame of my people will be on you
 sorrow is mine  for i am as when they have got in the summer fruits like the last of the grapes there is nothing for food not even an early fig for my desire
 the good man is gone from the earth there is no one upright among men they are all waiting secretly for blood every man is going after his brother with a net
 their hands are made ready to do evil the ruler makes requests for money and the judge is looking for a reward and the great man gives decisions at his pleasure and the right is twisted
 the best of them is like a waste plant and their upright ones are like a wall of thorns sorrow  the day of their fate has come now will trouble come on them
 put no faith in a friend do not let your hope be placed in a relation keep watch on the doors of your mouth against her who is resting on your breast
 for the son puts shame on his father the daughter goes against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law and a mans haters are those of his family
 but as for me i am looking to the lord i am waiting for the god of my salvation the ears of my god will be open to me
 do not be glad because of my sorrow o my hater after my fall i will be lifted up when i am seated in the dark the lord will be a light to me
 i will undergo the wrath of the lord because of my sin against him till he takes up my cause and does what is right for me when he makes me come out into the light i will see his righteousness
 and my hater will see it and be covered with shame she who said to me where is the lord your god my eyes will see their desire effected on her now she will be crushed under foot like the dust of the streets
 a day for building your walls  in that day will your limits be stretched far and wide
 in that day they will come to you from assyria and the towns of egypt and from egypt even to the river and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain
 but the land will become a waste because of its people as the fruit of their works
 keep your people safe with your rod the flock of your heritage living by themselves in the woods in the middle of carmel let them get their food in bashan and gilead as in the past
 as in the days when you came out from the land of egypt let us see things of wonder
 the nations will see and be shamed because of all their strength they will put their hands on their mouths their ears will be stopped
 they will take dust as their food like a snake like the things which go flat on the earth they will come shaking with fear out of their secret places they will come with fear to the lord our god full of fear because of you
 who is a god like you offering forgiveness for evil doing and overlooking the sins of the rest of his heritage he does not keep his wrath for ever because his delight is in mercy
 he will again have pity on us he will put our sins under his feet and you will send all our sins down into the heart of the sea
 you will make clear your good faith to jacob and your mercy to abraham as you gave your oath to our fathers from times long past
 the word about nineveh the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite
 the lord is a god who takes care of his honour and gives punishment for wrong the lord gives punishment and is angry the lord sends punishment on those who are against him being angry with his haters
 the lord is slow to get angry and great in power and will not let the sinner go without punishment the way of the lord is in the wind and the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet
 he says sharp words to the sea and makes it dry drying up all the rivers bashan is feeble and carmel and the flower of lebanon is without strength
 the mountains are shaking because of him and the hills flowing away the earth is falling to bits before him the world and all who are in it
 who may keep his place before his wrath and who may undergo the heat of his passion his wrath is let loose like fire and the rocks are broken open by him
 the lord is good a strong place in the day of trouble and he has knowledge of those who take him for their safe cover
 but like water overflowing he will take them away he will put an end to those who come up against him driving his haters into the dark
 what are you designing against the lord he will put an end to it his haters will not come up again a second time
 for though they are like twisted thorns and are overcome as with drink they will come to destruction like stems of grass fully dry
 one has gone out from you who is designing evil against the lord whose purposes are of no value
 this is what the lord has said the days of my cause against you are ended they are cut off and past though i have sent trouble on you you will no longer be troubled
 and now i will let his yoke be broken off you and your chains be parted
 the lord has given an order about you that no more of your name are to be planted from the house of your gods i will have the pictured and metal images cut off i will make your last resting place a place of shame for you are completely evil
 see on the mountains the feet of him who comes with good news giving word of peace  keep your feasts o judah give effect to your oaths for the good for nothing man will never again go through you he is completely cut off
 a crusher has come up before your face keep a good look out let the way be watched make yourself strong let your power be greatly increased
 for the lord will make good the vine of jacob as well as the vine of israel for the wasters have made them waste and sent destruction on the branches of their vine
 the body covers of his fighting men have been made red the men of war are clothed in bright red the war carriages are like flames of fire in the day when he gets ready the horses are shaking
 the war carriages are rushing through the streets pushing against one another in the wide ways looking like burning lights running like thunder flames
 he takes the record of his great men they go falling on their way they go quickly to the wall the cover is made ready
 the river doorways are forced open and the kings house is flowing away
 and the queen is uncovered she is taken away and her servant girls are weeping like the sound of doves hammering on their breasts
 but nineveh is like a pool of water whose waters are flowing away keep your place they say but no one is turning back
 take silver take gold for there is no end to the store take for yourselves a weight of things to be desired
 everything has been taken from her all is gone she has nothing more the heart is turned to water the knees are shaking all are twisted in pain and colour has gone from all faces
 where is the lions hole the place where the young lions got their food where the lion and the she lion were walking with their young without cause for fear
 food enough for his young and for his she lions was pulled down by the lion his hole was full of flesh and his resting place stored with meat
 see i am against you says the lord of armies and i will have your war carriages burned in the smoke and your young lions will be food for the sword you will no longer get your food by force on the earth and the voice of your she lions will be stopped for ever
 a curse is on the town of blood it is full of deceit and violent acts and there is no end to the taking of life
 the noise of the whip and the noise of thundering wheels horses rushing and war carriages jumping
 horsemen driving forward and the shining sword and the bright spear and a great number of wounded and masses of dead bodies they are falling over the bodies of the dead
 because of all the false ways of the loose woman expert in attraction and wise in secret arts who takes nations in the net of her false ways and families through her secret arts
 see i am against you says the lord of armies and i will have your skirts pulled over your face and let the nations see you unclothed and the kingdoms your shame
 i will make you completely disgusting and full of shame and will put you up to be looked at by all
 and it will come about that all who see you will go in flight from you and say nineveh is made waste who will be weeping for her where am i to get comforters for her
 are you better than no amon seated on the nile streams with waters all round her whose wall was the sea and her earthwork the waters
 ethiopia was her strength and egyptians without number put and lubim were her helpers
 but even she has been taken away she has gone away as a prisoner even her young children are smashed to bits at the top of all the streets the fate of her honoured men is put to the decision of chance and all her great men are put in chains
 and you will be overcome with wine you will become feeble you will be looking for a safe place from those who are fighting against you
 all your walled places will be like fig trees and your people like the first figs falling at a shake into the mouth which is open for them
 see the people who are in you are women the doorways of your land are wide open to your attackers the locks of your doors have been burned away in the fire
 get water for the time when you are shut in make strong your towns go into the potters earth stamping it down with your feet make strong the brickworks
 there the fire will make you waste you will be cut off by the sword make yourself as great in number as the worms as great in number as the locusts
 let your traders be increased more than the stars of heaven
 your crowned ones are like the locusts and your scribes like the clouds of insects which take cover in the walls on a cold day but when the sun comes up they go in flight and are seen no longer in their place
 sorrow  how are the keepers of your flock sleeping o king of assyria  your strong men are at rest your people are wandering on the mountains and there is no one to get them together
 your pain may not be made better you are wounded to death all those hearing the news about you will be waving their hands in joy over you for who has not undergone the weight of your evil doing again and again
 the history of nehemiah the son of hacaliah now it came about in the month chislev in the twentieth year when i was in shushan the kings town
 that hanani one of my brothers came with certain men from judah and in answer to my request for news of the jews who had been prisoners and had got away and of jerusalem
 they said to me the small band of jews now living there in the land are in great trouble and shame the wall of jerusalem has been broken down and its doorways burned with fire
 then after hearing these words for some days i gave myself up to weeping and sorrow seated on the earth and taking no food i made prayer to the god of heaven
 and said o lord the god of heaven the great god greatly to be feared keeping faith and mercy with those who have love for him and are true to his laws
 let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open so that you may give ear to the prayer of your servant which i make before you at this time day and night for the children of israel your servants while i put before you the sins of the children of israel which we have done against you truly i and my fathers people are sinners
 we have done great wrong against you and have not kept the orders the rules and the decisions which you gave to your servant moses
 keep in mind o lord the order you gave your servant moses saying if you do wrong i will send you wandering among the peoples
 but if you come back to me and keep my orders and do them even if those of you who have been forced out are living in the farthest parts of heaven i will get them from there and take them back to the place marked out by me for the resting place of my name
 now these are your servants and your people whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong hand
 o lord let your ear take note of the prayer of your servant and of the prayers of your servants who take delight in worshipping your name give help o lord to your servant this day and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man  now i was the kings wine servant

 the levites in the days of eliashib joiada and johanan and jaddua were listed as heads of families and the priests when darius the persian was king
 the sons of levi heads of families were recorded in the book of the histories even till the days of johanan the son of eliashib
 and the chiefs of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua the son of kadmiel with their brothers opposite them to give blessing and praise as ordered by david the man of god watch against watch
 mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub were door keepers keeping the watch at the store houses of the doors
 these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the ruler and of ezra the priest the scribe
 and when the time came for the wall of jerusalem to be made holy they sent for the levites out of all their places to come to jerusalem to keep the feast with joy and with praise and melody with brass and corded instruments of music
 and the sons of the music makers came together from the lowland round about jerusalem and from the daughter towns of the netophathites
 and from beth gilgal and from the fields of geba and azmaveth for the music makers had made daughter towns for themselves round about jerusalem
 and the priests and the levites made themselves clean and they made the people clean and the doorways and the wall
 then i made the rulers of judah come up on the wall and i put in position two great bands of them who gave praise walking in ordered lines one went to the right on the wall in the direction of the doorway where the waste was put
 and after them went hoshaiah and half of the rulers of judah
 and azariah ezra and meshullam
 judah and benjamin and shemaiah and jeremiah
 and certain of the priests sons with wind instruments zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of mattaniah the son of micaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph
 and his brothers shemaiah and azarel milalai gilalai maai nethanel and judah hanani with the music instruments of david the man of god and ezra the scribe was at their head
 and by the doorway of the fountain and straight in front of them they went up by the steps of the town of david at the slope up of the wall over the house of david as far as the water doorway to the east
 and the other band of those who gave praise went to the left and i went after them with half the people on the wall over the tower of the ovens as far as the wide wall
 and over the doorway of ephraim and by the old door and the fish door and the tower of hananel and the tower of hammeah as far as the sheep door and at the doorway of the watchmen they came to a stop
 so the two bands of those who gave praise took up their positions in the house of god and i and half of the chiefs with me
 and the priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin micaiah elioenai zechariah and hananiah with wind instruments
 and maaseiah and shemaiah and eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer and the makers of melody made their voices loud with jezrahiah their overseer
 and on that day they made great offerings and were glad for god had made them glad with great joy and the women and the children were glad with them so that the joy of jerusalem came to the ears of those who were far off
 and on that day certain men were put over the rooms where the things which had been given were stored for the lifted offerings and the first fruits and the tenths and to take into them the amounts from the fields of every town fixed by the law for the priests and the levites for judah was glad on account of the priests and the levites who were in their places
 and they kept the watch of their god and were responsible for making things clean and so did the music makers and the door keepers as it was ordered by david and solomon his son
 for in the days of david and asaph in the past there was a master of the music and songs of blessing and praise to god
 and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave what was needed by the music makers and the door keepers day by day and they made the offerings holy for the levites and the levites did the same for the sons of aaron
 on that day there was a reading from the book of moses in the hearing of the people and they saw that it said in the book that no ammonite or moabite might ever come into the meeting of god
 because they did not give the children of israel bread and water when they came to them but got balaam to put a curse on them though the curse was turned into a blessing by our god
 so after hearing the law they took out of israel all the mixed people
 now before this eliashib the priest who had been placed over the rooms of the house of our god being a friend of tobiah
 had made ready for him a great room where at one time they kept the meal offerings the perfume and the vessels and the tenths of the grain and wine and oil which were given by order to the levites and the music makers and the door keepers and the lifted offerings for the priests
 but all this time i was not at jerusalem for in the thirty second year of artaxerxes king of babylon i went to the king and after some days i got the king to let me go
 and i came to jerusalem and it was clear to me what evil eliashib had done for tobiah in making ready for him a room in the buildings of the house of god
 and it was evil in my eyes so i had all tobiahs things put out of the room
 then i gave orders and they made the rooms clean and i put back in them the vessels of the house of god with the meal offerings and the perfume
 and i saw that the levites had not been given what was needed for their support so that the levites and the music makers who did the work had gone away everyone to his field
 then i made protests to the chiefs and said why has the house of god been given up and i got them together and put them in their places
 then all judah came with the tenth part of the grain and wine and oil and put it into the store houses
 and i made controllers over the store houses shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and with them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah they were taken to be true men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers
 keep me in mind o my god in connection with this and do not let the good which i have done for the house of my god and its worship go from your memory completely
 in those days i saw in judah some who were crushing grapes on the sabbath and getting in grain and putting it on asses as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods which they took into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i gave witness against them on the day when they were marketing food
 and there were men of tyre there who came with fish and all sorts of goods trading with the children of judah and in jerusalem on the sabbath
 then i made protests to the chiefs of judah and said to them what is this evil which you are doing not keeping the sabbath day holy
 did not your fathers do the same and did not our god send all this evil on us and on this town but you are causing more wrath to come on israel by not keeping the sabbath holy
 and so when the streets of jerusalem were getting dark before the sabbath i gave orders for the doors to be shut and not to be open again till after the sabbath and i put some of my servants by the door so that nothing might be taken in on the sabbath day
 so the traders in all sorts of goods took their nights rest outside jerusalem once or twice
 then i gave witness against them and said why are you waiting all night by the wall if you do so again i will have you taken prisoners from that time they did not come again on the sabbath
 and i gave the levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the doors and make the sabbath holy keep this in mind to my credit o my god and have mercy on me for great is your mercy
 and in those days i saw the jews who were married to women of ashdod and ammon and moab
 and their children were talking half in the language of ashdod they had no knowledge of the jews language but made use of the language of the two peoples
 and i took up the cause against them cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair and i made them take an oath by god saying you are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves
 was it not in these things that solomon king of israel did wrong among a number of nations there was no king like him and he was dear to his god and god made him king over all israel but even he was made to do evil by strange women
 are we then without protest to let you do all this great evil sinning against our god by taking strange women for your wives
 and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the chief priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite so i sent him away from me
 keep them in mind o my god because they have put shame on the priests name and on the agreement of the priests and the levites
 so i made them clean from all strange people and had regular watches fixed for the priests and for the levites everyone in his work
 and for the wood offering at fixed times and for the first fruits keep me in mind o my god for good
 and it came about in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king when wine was before him that i took up the wine and gave it to the king now i had never before been sad when the king was present
 and the king said to me why is your face sad seeing that you are not ill this is nothing but sorrow of heart then i was full of fear
 and said to the king may the king be living for ever is it not natural for my face to be sad when the town the place where the bodies of my fathers are at rest has been made waste and its doorways burned with fire
 then the king said to me what is your desire so i made prayer to the god of heaven
 and i said to the king if it is the kings pleasure and if your servant has your approval send me to judah to the town where the bodies of my fathers are at rest so that i may take in hand the building of it
 and the king said to me  the queen being seated by his side  how long will your journey take and when will you come back so the king was pleased to send me and i gave him a fixed time
 further i said to the king if it is the kings pleasure let letters be given to me for the rulers across the river so that they may let me go through till i come to judah
 and a letter to asaph the keeper of the kings park so that he may give me wood to make boards for the doors of the tower of the house and for the wall of the town and for the house which is to be mine and the king gave me this for the hand of my god was on me
 then i came to the rulers of the lands across the river and gave them the kings letters now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen
 and sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite hearing of it were greatly troubled because a man had come to the help of the children of israel
 so i came to jerusalem and was there three days
 and in the night i got up taking with me a small band of men i said nothing to any man of what god had put into my heart to do for jerusalem and i had no beast with me but the one on which i was seated
 and i went out by night through the doorway of the valley and past the dragons water spring as far as the place where waste material was put viewing the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and the doorways which had been burned with fire
 then i went on to the door of the fountain and to the kings pool but there was no room for my beast to get through
 then in the night i went up by the stream viewing the wall then turning back i went in by the door in the valley and so came back
 and the chiefs had no knowledge of where i had been or what i was doing and i had not then said anything to the jews or to the priests or the great ones or the chiefs or the rest of those who were doing the work
 then i said to them you see what a bad condition we are in how jerusalem is a waste and its doorways burned with fire come let us get to work building up the wall of jerusalem so that we may no longer be put to shame
 then i gave them an account of how the hand of my god was on me helping me and of the kings words which he had said to me and they said let us get to work on the building so they made their hands strong for the good work
 but sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian hearing of it made sport of us laughing at us and saying what are you doing will you go against the king
 then answering them i said the god of heaven he will be our help so we his servants will go on with our building but you have no part or right or any name in jerusalem
 then eliashib the chief priest got up with his brothers the priests and took in hand the building of the sheep doorway they made it holy and put its doors in position as far as the tower of hammeah they made it holy even to the tower of hananel
 and by his side the men of jericho were building and after them zaccur the son of imri
 the sons of hassenaah were the builders of the fish doorway they put its boards in place and put up its doors with their locks and rods
 by their side meremoth the son of uriah the son of hakkoz was making good the walls then meshullam the son of berechiah the son of meshezabel and by him zadok the son of baana
 near them the tekoites were at work but their chiefs did not put their necks to the work of their lord
 joiada the son of paseah and meshullam the son of besodeiah made good the old doorway they put its boards in place and put up its doors with their locks and rods
 by their side were working melatiah the gibeonite and jadon the meronothite the men of gibeon and of mizpah from the seat of the ruler across the river
 near them was working uzziel the son of harhaiah the gold worker and by him was hananiah one of the perfume makers building up jerusalem as far as the wide wall
 near them was working rephaiah the son of hur the ruler of half jerusalem
 by his side was jedaiah the son of harumaph opposite his house and by him was hattush the son of hashabneiah
 malchijah the son of harim and hasshub the son of pahath moab were working on another part and the tower of the ovens
 near them was shallum the son of hallohesh the ruler of half jerusalem with his daughters
 hanun and the people of zanoah were working on the doorway of the valley they put it up and put up its doors with their locks and rods and a thousand cubits of wall as far as the doorway where the waste material was placed
 and malchijah the son of rechab the ruler of the division of beth haccherem made good the doorway of the waste building it up and putting up its doors with their locks and rods
 and shallun the son of col hozeh the ruler of the division of mizpah made good the doorway of the fountain building it up and covering it and putting up its doors with their locks and rods with the wall of the pool of shelah by the kings garden as far as the steps which go down from the town of david
 by his side was working nehemiah the son of azbuk ruler of half the division of beth zur as far as the place opposite the last resting places of davids family and the pool which was made and the house of the men of war
 then came the levites rehum the son of bani by his side was working hashabiah ruler of half the division of keilah for his division
 after him were working their brothers bavvai the son of henadad ruler of half the division of keilah
 and by his side was working ezer the son of jeshua the ruler of mizpah making good another part opposite the way up to the store of arms at the turning of the wall
 after him baruch the son of zabbai was hard at work on another part from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of eliashib the chief priest
 after him meremoth the son of uriah the son of hakkoz was working on another part from the door of the house of eliashib as far as the end of his house
 after him were working the priests the men of the lowland
 after them came benjamin and hasshub opposite their house after them azariah the son of maaseiah the son of ananiah made good the wall by the house where he himself was living
 after him binnui the son of henadad was working on another part from the house of azariah as far as the turning of the wall and the angle
 palal the son of uzai made good the wall opposite the angle and the tower which comes out from the higher part of the kings house by the open space of the watch after him was pedaiah the son of parosh
  now the nethinim were living in the ophel as far as the place facing the water doorway to the east and the tower which comes out 
 after him the tekoites were making good another part opposite the great tower which comes out and up to the wall of the ophel
 further on past the horse doorway the priests were at work every one opposite his house
 after them zadok the son of immer was working opposite his house and after him shemaiah the son of shecaniah the keeper of the east door
 after him hananiah the son of shelemiah and hanun the sixth son of zalaph were making good another part after him meshullam the son of berechiah made good the wall opposite his room
 after him malchijah one of the gold workers to the nethinim and the traders made good the wall opposite the doorway of hammiphkad and as far as the way up to the angle
 and between the way up to the angle and the sheep door the gold workers and the traders made good the wall
 now sanballat hearing that we were building the wall was very angry and in his wrath made sport of the jews
 and in the hearing of his countrymen and the army of samaria he said what are these feeble jews doing will they make themselves strong will they make offerings will they get the work done in a day will they make the stones which have been burned come again out of the dust
 now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said such is their building that if a fox goes up it their stone wall will be broken down
 give ear o our god for we are looked down on let their words of shame be turned back on themselves and let them be given up to wasting in a land where they are prisoners
 let not their wrongdoing be covered or their sin washed away from before you for they have made you angry before the builders
 so we went on building the wall and all the wall was joined together half way up for the people were working hard
 but when it came to the ears of sanballat and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites that the building of the walls of jerusalem was going forward and the broken places were being made good they were full of wrath
 and they made designs all of them together to come and make an attack on jerusalem causing trouble there
 but we made our prayer to god and had men on watch against them day and night because of them
 and judah said the strength of the workmen is giving way and there is much waste material it is impossible for us to put up the wall
 and those who were against us said without their knowledge and without their seeing us we will come among them and put them to death causing the work to come to a stop
 and it came about that when the jews who were living near them came they said to us ten times from all directions they are coming against us
 so in the lowest part of the space at the back of the walls in the open places i put the people by families with their swords their spears and their bows
 and after looking i got up and said to the great ones and to the chiefs and to the rest of the people have no fear of them keep in mind the lord who is great and greatly to be feared and take up arms for your brothers your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses
 and when it came to the ears of those who were against us that we had knowledge of their designs and that god had made their purpose come to nothing we all went back to the wall everyone to his work
 and from that time half of my servants were doing their part of the work and half kept the spears and body covers and the bows and the metal war dresses and the chiefs were at the back of the men of judah
 those who were building the wall and those who were moving material did their part everyone working with one hand with his spear in the other
 every builder was working with his sword at his side and by my side was a man for sounding the horn
 and i said to the great ones and the chiefs and the rest of the people the work is great and widely spaced and we are far away from one another on the wall
 wherever you may be when the horn is sounded come here to us our god will be fighting for us
 so we went on with the work and half of them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the stars were seen
 and at the same time i said to the people let everyone with his servant come inside jerusalem for the night so that at night they may keep watch for us and go on working by day
 so not one of us i or my brothers or my servants or the watchmen who were with me took off his clothing everyone went armed to the water
 then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their countrymen the jews
 for there were some who said we our sons and our daughters are a great number let us get grain so that we may have food for our needs
 and there were some who said we are giving our fields and our vine gardens and our houses for debt let us get grain because we are in need
 and there were others who said we have given up our fields and our vine gardens to get money for the kings taxes
 but our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen and our children as their children and now we are giving our sons and daughters into the hands of others to be their servants and some of our daughters are servants even now and we have no power to put a stop to it for other men have our fields and our vine gardens
 and on hearing their outcry and what they said i was very angry
 and after turning it over in my mind i made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers and said to them every one of you is taking interest from his countryman and i got together a great meeting of protest
 and i said to them we have given whatever we were able to give to make our brothers the jews free who were servants and prisoners of the nations and would you now give up your brothers for a price and are they to become our property then they said nothing answering not a word
 and i said what you are doing is not good is it not the more necessary for you to go in the fear of our god because of the shame which the nations may put on us
 even i and my servants have been taking interest for the money and the grain we have let them have so now let us give up this thing
 give back to them this very day their fields their vine gardens their olive gardens and their houses as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil which you have taken from them
 then they said we will give them back and take nothing for them we will do as you say then i sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement
 and shaking out the folds of my robe i said so may god send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement even so let him be sent out and made as nothing and all the meeting of the people said so be it and gave praise to the lord and the people did as they had said
 now from the time when i was made ruler of the people in the land of judah from the twentieth year till the thirty second year of artaxerxes the king for twelve years i and my servants have never taken the food which was the right of the ruler
 but earlier rulers who were before me made the people responsible for their upkeep and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver and even their servants were lords over the people but i did not do so because of the fear of god
 and i kept on with the work of this wall and we got no land for ourselves and all my servants were helping with the work
 and more than this a hundred and fifty of the jews and the rulers were guests at my table in addition to those who came to us from the nations round about us
 now the food made ready for one day was one ox and six fat sheep as well as fowls and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine but all the same i did not take the food to which the ruler had a right because the people were crushed under a hard yoke
 keep in mind o my god for my good all i have done for this people
 now when word was given to sanballat and tobiah and to geshem the arabian and to the rest of our haters that i had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken places in it  though even then i had not put up the doors in the doorways 
 sanballat and geshem sent to me saying come let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of ono but their purpose was to do me evil
 and i sent men to them saying i am doing a great work so that it is not possible for me to come down is the work to be stopped while i go away from it and come down to you
 and four times they sent to me in this way and i sent them the same answer
 then sanballat sent his servant to me a fifth time with an open letter in his hand
 and in it these words were recorded it is said among the nations and geshem says so that you and the jews are hoping to make yourselves free from the kings authority and that this is why you are building the wall and they say that it is your purpose to be their king
 and that you have prophets preaching about you in jerusalem and saying there is a king in judah now an account of these things will be sent to the king so come now and let us have a discussion
 then i sent to him saying no such things as you say are being done they are only a fiction you have made up yourself
 for they were hoping to put fear in us saying their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it may not get done but now o god make my hands strong
 and i went to the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabel who was shut up and he said let us have a meeting in the house of god inside the temple and let the doors be shut for they will come to put you to death truly in the night they will come to put you to death
 and i said am i the sort of man to go in flight what man in my position would go into the temple to keep himself safe i will not go in
 then it became clear to me that god had not sent him he had given this word of a prophet against me himself and tobiah and sanballat had given him money to do so
 for this reason they had given him money in order that i might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do wrong and so they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame on me
 keep in mind o my god tobiah and sanballat and what they did and noadiah the woman prophet and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to put fear into me
 so the wall was complete on the twenty fifth day of the month elul in fifty two days
 and when our haters had news of this all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed for they saw that this work had been done by our god
 and further in those days the chiefs of judah sent a number of letters to tobiah and his letters came to them
 for in judah there were a number of people who had made an agreement by oath with him because he was the son in law of shecaniah the son of arah and his son jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah
 and they said much before me of the good he had done and gave him accounts of my words and tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear
 now when the building of the wall was complete and i had put up the doors and the door keepers and the music makers and the levites had been given their places
 i made my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the tower responsible for the government of jerusalem for he was a man of good faith fearing god more than most
 and i said to them do not let the doors of jerusalem be open till the sun is high and while the watchmen are in their places let the doors be shut and locked and let the people of jerusalem be put on watch every one in his watch opposite his house
 now the town was wide and great but the people in it were only a small number and the houses had not been put up
 and my god put it into my heart to get together the rulers and the chiefs and the people so that they might be listed by families and i came across a record of the names of those who came up at the first and in it i saw these words
 these are the people of the divisions of the kingdom among those who had been made prisoners by nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and taken away by him who went back to jerusalem and judah every one to his town

 all the nethinim and the children of solomons servants were three hundred and ninety two
 all these were the people who went up from tel melah tel harsha cherub addon and immer but because they had no knowledge of their fathers families or offspring it was not certain if they were israelites
 the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six hundred and forty two
 and of the priests the children of hobaiah the children of hakkoz the children of barzillai who was married to one of the daughters of barzillai the gileadite and took their name
 they made search for their record among the lists of families but their names were nowhere to be seen so they were looked on as unclean and no longer priests
 and the tirshatha said that they were not to have the most holy things for their food till a priest came to give decision by the urim and thummim
 the number of all the people together was forty two thousand three hundred and sixty
 as well as their men servants and their women servants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven and they had two hundred and forty five men and women to make music
 they had seven hundred and thirty six horses two hundred and forty five transport beasts
 four hundred and thirty five camels six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
 and some of the heads of families gave money for the work the tirshatha gave into the store a thousand darics of gold fifty basins five hundred and thirty priests robes
 and some of the heads of families gave into the store for the work twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand two hundred pounds of silver
 and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold and two thousand pounds of silver and sixty seven priests robes
 so the priests and the levites and the door keepers and the music makers and some of the people and the nethinim and all israel were living in their towns
 and when the seventh month came the children of israel were in their towns and all the people came together like one man into the wide place in front of the water doorway and they made a request to ezra the scribe that he would put before them the book of the law of moses which the lord had given to israel
 and ezra the priest put the law before the meeting of the people before the men and women and all those who were able to take it in on the first day of the seventh month
 he was reading it in the wide place in front of the water doorway from early morning till the middle of the day in the hearing of all those men and women whose minds were able to take it in and the ears of all the people were open to the book of the law
 and ezra the scribe took his place on a tower of wood which they had made for the purpose and by his side were placed mattithiah and shema and anaiah and uriah and hilkiah and maaseiah on the right and on the left pedaiah and mishael and malchijah and hashum and hashbaddanah zechariah and meshullam
 and ezra took the book opening it before the eyes of all the people  for he was higher than the people  and when it was open all the people got to their feet
 and ezra gave praise to the lord the great god and all the people in answer said so be it so be it lifting up their hands and with bent heads they gave worship to the lord going down on their faces to the earth
 and jeshua and bani and sherebiah and jamin akkub shabbethai hodiah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the levites made the law clear to the people and the people kept in their places
 and they gave out the words of the book the law of god clearly and gave the sense of it so that their minds were able to take it in
 and nehemiah who was the tirshatha and ezra the priest and scribe and the levites who were the teachers of the people said to all the people this day is holy to the lord your god let there be no sorrow or weeping for all the people were weeping on hearing the words of the law
 then he said to them go away now and take the fat for your food and the sweet for your drink and send some to him for whom nothing is made ready for this day is holy to our lord and let there be no grief in your hearts for the joy of the lord is your strong place
 so the levites made all the people quiet saying be quiet for the day is holy and do not give way to grief
 and all the people went away to take food and drink and to send food to others and to be glad because the words which were said to them had been made clear
 and on the second day the heads of families of all the people and the priests and the levites came together to ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the law
 and they saw that it was recorded in the law that the lord had given orders by moses that the children of israel were to have tents for their living places in the feast of the seventh month
 and that they were to give out an order and make it public in all their towns and in jerusalem saying go out to the mountain and get olive branches and branches of field olives and of myrtle and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make tents as it says in the book
 and the people went out and got them and made themselves tents every one on the roof of his house and in the open spaces and in the open squares of the house of god and in the wide place of the water doorway and the wide place of the doorway of ephraim
 all the people who had been prisoners and had come back made tents and were living in them for from the time of jeshua the son of nun till that day the children of israel had not done so and there was very great joy
 and day by day from the first day till the last he was reading from the book of the law of god and they kept the feast for seven days and on the eighth day there was a holy meeting as it is ordered in the law
 now on the twenty fourth day of this month the children of israel came together taking no food and putting haircloth and dust on their bodies
 and the seed of israel made themselves separate from all the men of other nations publicly requesting forgiveness for their sins and the wrongdoing of their fathers
 and for a fourth part of the day upright in their places they were reading from the book of the law of their god and for a fourth part of the day they were requesting forgiveness and worshipping the lord their god
 then jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani took their places on the steps of the levites crying in a loud voice to the lord their god
 then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabneiah sherebiah hodiah shebaniah and pethahiah said get up and give praise to the lord your god for ever and ever praise be to your great name which is lifted up high over all blessing and praise
 you are the lord even you only you have made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their armies the earth and all things in it the seas and everything in them and you keep them from destruction and the armies of heaven are your worshippers
 you are the lord the god who took abram and made him yours guiding him from ur of the chaldees and gave him the name of abraham
 you saw that his heart was true to you and made an agreement with him to give the land of the canaanite the hittite the amorite and the perizzite and the jebusite and the girgashite even to give it to his seed and you have done what you said for righteousness is yours
 and you saw the trouble of our fathers in egypt and their cry came to your ears by the red sea
 and you did signs and wonders on pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land for you saw how cruel they were to them so you got yourself a name as it is today
 by you the sea was parted before them so that they went through the sea on dry land and those who went after them went down into the deep like a stone into great waters
 and you went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light on the way they were to go
 and you came down on mount sinai and your voice came to them from heaven giving them right decisions and true laws good rules and orders
 and you gave them word of your holy sabbath and gave them orders and rules and a law by the hand of moses your servant
 and you gave them bread from heaven when they were in need and made water come out of the rock for their drink and gave them orders to go in and take for their heritage the land which your hand had been lifted up to give them
 but they and our fathers in their pride made their necks stiff and gave no attention to your orders
 and would not do them and gave no thought to the wonders you had done among them but made their necks stiff and turning away from you made a captain over themselves to take them back to their prison in egypt but you are a god of forgiveness full of grace and pity slow to wrath and great in mercy and you did not give them up
 even when they had made for themselves an ox of metal and said this is your god who took you up out of egypt and had done so much to make you angry
 even then in your great mercy you did not give them up in the waste land the pillar of cloud still went before them by day guiding them on their way and the pillar of fire by night to give them light and make clear the way they were to go
 and you gave your good spirit to be their teacher and did not keep back your manna from their mouths and gave them water when they had need of it
 truly for forty years you were their support in the waste land and they were in need of nothing their clothing did not get old or their feet become tired
 and you gave them kingdoms and peoples making distribution to them in every part of the land so they took for their heritage the land of sihon even the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan
 and you made their children as great in number as the stars of heaven and took them into the land of which you had said to their fathers that they were to go in and take it for themselves
 so the children went in and took the land and you overcame before them the people of the land the canaanites and gave them up into their hands with their kings and the people of the land so that they might do with them whatever it was their pleasure to do
 and they took walled towns and a fat land and became the owners of houses full of all good things water holes cut in the rock vine gardens and olive gardens and a wealth of fruit trees so they had food enough and became fat and had joy in the good you gave them
 but they were hard hearted and went against your authority turning their backs on your law and putting to death your prophets who gave witness against them with the purpose of turning them back again to you and they did much to make you angry
 and so you gave them up into the hands of their haters who were cruel to them and in the time of their trouble when they made their prayer to you you gave ear to them from heaven and in your great mercy gave them saviours who made them free from the hands of their haters
 but when they had rest they did evil again before you so you gave them into the hands of their haters who had rule over them but when they came back and made their prayer to you you gave ear to them from heaven again and again in your mercy you gave them salvation
 and gave witness against them so that you might make them come back again to your law but their hearts were lifted up and they gave no attention to your orders and went against your decisions  which if a man keeps them will be life to him  and turning their backs on you made their necks stiff and did not give ear
 year after year you put up with them and gave witness against them by your spirit through your prophets still they did not give ear and so you gave them up into the hands of the peoples of the lands
 even then in your great mercy you did not put an end to them completely or give them up for you are a god of grace and mercy
 and now our god the great the strong the god who is to be feared who keeps faith and mercy let not all this trouble seem small to you which has come on us and on our kings and our rulers and on our priests and our prophets and our fathers and on all your people from the time of the kings of assyria till this day
 but still you have been in the right in everything which has come on us you have been true to us but we have done evil
 and our kings our rulers our priests and our fathers have not kept your law or given attention to your orders and your witness with which you gave witness against them
 for they have not been your servants in their kingdom and in all the good things you gave them and in the great and fat land you gave them and they have not been turned away from their evil doing
 now today we are servants and as for the land which you gave to our fathers so that the produce of it and the good might be theirs see we are servants in it
 and it gives much increase to the kings whom you have put over us because of our sins and they have power over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great trouble
 and because of all this we are making an agreement in good faith and putting it in writing and our rulers our levites and our priests are putting their names to it
 and the lord said to moses in the waste land of sinai in the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year after they came out of the land of egypt
 take the full number of the children of israel by their families and by their fathers houses every male by name
 all those of twenty years old and over who are able to go to war in israel are to be numbered by you and aaron
 and to give you help take one man from every tribe the head of his fathers house
 these are the names of those who are to be your helpers from reuben elizur the son of shedeur
 from simeon shelumiel the son of zurishaddai
 from judah nahshon the son of amminadab
 from issachar nethanel the son of zuar
 from zebulun eliab the son of helon
 of the children of joseph from ephraim elishama the son of ammihud from manasseh gamaliel the son of pedahzur
 from benjamin abidan the son of gideoni
 from dan ahiezer the son of ammi shaddai
 from asher pagiel the son of ochran
 from gad eliasaph the son of reuel
 from naphtali ahira the son of enan
 these are the men named out of all the people chiefs of their fathers houses heads of the tribes of israel
 and moses and aaron took these men marked out by name
 and they got together all the people on the first day of the second month and everyone made clear his family and his fathers house by the number of the names from twenty years old and over
 as the lord had given orders to moses so they were numbered by him in the waste place of sinai
 the generations of the sons of reuben the oldest son of israel were numbered by their families and their fathers houses every male of twenty years old and over who was able to go to war
 forty six thousand five hundred of the tribe of reuben were numbered
 the generations of the sons of simeon were numbered by their families and their fathers houses every male of twenty years old and over who was able to go to war
 fifty nine thousand three hundred of the tribe of simeon were numbered
 the generations of the sons of gad were numbered by their families and their fathers houses every male of twenty years old and over who was able to go to war
 forty five thousand six hundred and fifty of the tribe of gad were numbered
 the generations of the sons of judah were numbered by their families and their fathers houses every male of twenty years old and over who was able to go to war
 seventy four thousand six hundred of the tribe of judah were numbered
 the generations of the sons of issachar were numbered by their families and their fathers houses every male of twenty years old and over who was able to go to war
 fifty four thousand four hundred of the tribe of issachar were numbered

 fifty seven thousand four hundred of the tribe of zebulun were numbered

 fifty three thousand four hundred of the tribe of naphtali were numbered
 these are they who were numbered by moses and aaron and by the twelve chiefs of israel one from every tribe
 so all those who were numbered of the children of israel by their families all those of twenty years old and over who were able to go to war
 were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty
 but the levites of the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them
 for the lord said to moses
 only the tribe of levi is not to be numbered among the children of israel
 but to them you are to give the care of the tent of meeting with its vessels and everything in it they are to take up the tent and be responsible for everything to do with it and put up their tents round it
 and when the tent of meeting goes forward the levites are to take it down and when it is to be put up they are to do it any strange person who comes near it is to be put to death
 the children of israel are to put up their tents every man in his tent circle round his flag
 but the tents of the levites are to be round the tent of meeting so that wrath may not come on the children of israel the tent of meeting is to be in the care of the levites
 so the children of israel did as the lord had given orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses
 make two silver horns of hammered work to be used for getting the people together and to give the sign for the moving of the tents
 when they are sounded all the people are to come together to you at the door of the tent of meeting
 if only one of them is sounded then the chiefs the heads of the thousands of israel are to come to you
 when a loud note is sounded the tents placed on the east side are to go forward
 at the sound of a second loud note the tents on the south side are to go forward the loud note will be the sign to go forward
 but when all the people are to come together the horn is to be sounded but not loudly
 the horns are to be sounded by the sons of aaron the priests this is to be a law for you for ever from generation to generation
 and if you go to war in your land against any who do you wrong then let the loud note of the horn be sounded and the lord your god will keep you in mind and give you salvation from those who are against you
 and on days of joy and on your regular feasts and on the first day of every month let the horns be sounded over your burned offerings and your peace offerings and they will put the lord in mind of you i am the lord your god
 now in the second year on the twentieth day of the second month the cloud was taken up from over the tent of witness
 and the children of israel went on their journey out of the waste land of sinai and the cloud came to rest in the waste land of paran
 they went forward for the first time on their journey as the lord had given orders by the hand of moses
 first the flag of the children of judah went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was nahshon the son of amminadab
 and at the head of the army of the children of issachar was nethanel the son of zuar
 and at the head of the army of the children of zebulun was eliab the son of helon
 then the house was taken down and the sons of gershon and the sons of merari who were responsible for moving the house went forward

 at the head of the army of the children of manasseh was gamaliel the son of pedahzur
 at the head of the army of the children of benjamin was abidan the son of gideoni
 and the flag of the children of dan whose tents were moved last of all went forward with their armies and at the head of his army was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai
 at the head of the army of the children of asher was pagiel the son of ochran
 and at the head of the army of the children of naphtali was ahira the son of enan
 this was the order in which the children of israel were journeying by armies so they went forward
 then moses said to hobab the son of his father in law reuel the midianite we are journeying to that place of which the lord has said i will give it to you so come with us and it will be for your profit for the lord has good things in store for israel
 but he said i will not go with you i will go back to the land of my birth and to my relations
 and he said do not go from us for you will be eyes for us guiding us to the right places in the waste land to put up our tents
 and if you come with us we will give you a part in whatever good the lord does for us
 so they went forward three days journey from the mountain of the lord and the ark of the lords agreement went three days journey before them looking for a resting place for them
 and by day the cloud of the lord went over them when they went forward from the place where they had put up their tents
 and when the ark went forward moses said come up o lord and let the armies of those who are against you be broken and let your haters go in flight before you
 and when it came to rest he said take rest o lord and give a blessing to the families of israel
 now the people were saying evil against the lord and the lord hearing it was angry and sent fire on them burning the outer parts of the tent circle
 and the people made an outcry to moses and moses made prayer to the lord and the fire was stopped
 so that place was named taberah because of the fire of the lord which had been burning among them
 and the mixed band of people who went with them were overcome by desire and the children of israel weeping again said who will give us flesh for our food
 sweet is the memory of the fish we had in egypt for nothing and the fruit and green plants of every sort sharp and pleasing to the taste
 but now our soul is wasted away there is nothing at all we have nothing but this manna before our eyes
 now the manna was like a seed of grain like small clear drops
 the people went about taking it up from the earth crushing it between stones or hammering it to powder and boiling it in pots and they made cakes of it its taste was like the taste of cakes cooked with oil
 when the dew came down on the tents at night the manna came down with it
 and at the sound of the people weeping every man at his tent door the wrath of the lord was great and moses was very angry
 and moses said to the lord why have you done me this evil and why have i not grace in your eyes that you have put on me the care of all this people
 am i the father of all this people have i given them birth that you say to me take them in your arms like a child at the breast to the land which you gave by an oath to their fathers
 where am i to get flesh to give to all this people for they are weeping to me and saying give us flesh for our food
 i am not able by myself to take the weight of all this people for it is more than my strength
 if this is to be my fate put me to death now in answer to my prayer if i have grace in your eyes and let me not see my shame
 and the lord said to moses send for seventy of the responsible men of israel who are in your opinion men of weight and authority over the people make them come to the tent of meeting and be there with you
 and i will come down and have talk with you there and i will take some of the spirit which is on you and put it on them and they will take part of the weight of the people off you so that you do not have to take it by yourself
 and say to the people make yourselves clean before tomorrow and you will have flesh for your food for in the ears of the lord you have been weeping and saying who will give us flesh for food for we were well off in egypt and so the lord will give you flesh and it will be your food
 not for one day only or even for five or ten or twenty days
 but every day for a month till you are tired of it turning from it in disgust because you have gone against the lord who is with you and have been weeping before him saying why did we come out of egypt
 then moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand men on foot and you have said i will give them flesh to be their food for a month
 are flocks and herds to be put to death for them or are all the fish in the sea to be got together so that they may be full
 and the lord said to moses has the lords hand become short now you will see if my word comes true for you or not
 and moses went out and gave the people the words of the lord and he took seventy of the responsible men of the people placing them round the tent
 then the lord came down in the cloud and had talk with him and put on the seventy men some of the spirit which was on him now when the spirit came to rest on them they were like prophets but only at that time
 but two men were still in the tent circle one of them named eldad and the other medad and the spirit came to rest on them they were among those who had been sent for but they had not gone out to the tent and the prophets power came on them in the tent circle
 and a young man went running to moses and said eldad and medad are acting as prophets in the tent circle
 then joshua the son of nun who had been moses servant from the time when he was a child said my lord moses let them be stopped
 and moses said to him are you moved by envy on my account if only all the lords people were prophets and the lord might put his spirit on them 
 then moses with the responsible men of israel went back to the tent circle
 then the lord sent a wind driving little birds from the sea so that they came down on the tents and all round the tent circle about a days journey on this side and on that in masses about two cubits high over the face of the earth
 and all that day and all night and the day after the people were taking up the birds the smallest amount which anyone got was ten homers and they put them out all round the tents
 but while the meat was still between their teeth before it was tasted the wrath of the lord was moved against the people and he sent a great outburst of disease on them
 so that place was named kibroth hattaavah because there they put in the earth the bodies of the people who had given way to their desires
 from kibroth hattaavah the people went on to hazeroth and there they put up their tents
 now miriam and aaron said evil against moses because of the cushite woman to whom he was married for he had taken a cushite woman as his wife
 and they said have the words of the lord been given to moses only have they not come to us and the lord took note of it
 now the man moses was more gentle than any other man on earth
 and suddenly the lord said to moses and aaron and miriam come out you three to the tent of meeting and the three of them went out
 and the lord came down in a pillar of cloud taking his place at the door of the tent and made aaron and miriam come before him
 and he said now give ear to my words if there is a prophet among you i will give him knowledge of myself in a vision and will let my words come to him in a dream
 my servant moses is not so he is true to me in all my house
 with him i will have talk mouth to mouth openly and not in dark sayings and with his eyes he will see the form of the lord why then had you no fear of saying evil against my servant moses
 and burning with wrath against them the lord went away
 and the cloud was moved from over the tent and straight away miriam became a leper as white as snow and aaron looking at miriam saw that she was a leper
 then aaron said to moses o my lord let not our sin be on our heads for we have done foolishly and are sinners
 let her not be as one dead whose flesh is half wasted when he comes out from the body of his mother
 and moses crying to the lord said let my prayer come before you o god and make her well
 and the lord said to moses if her father had put a mark of shame on her would she not be shamed for seven days let her be shut up outside the tent circle for seven days and after that she may come in again
 so miriam was shut up outside the tent circle for seven days and the people did not go forward on their journey till miriam had come in again
 after that the people went on from hazeroth and put up their tents in the waste land of paran
 and the lord said to moses
 send men to get knowledge about the land of canaan which i am giving to the children of israel from every tribe of their fathers you are to send a man every one a chief among them
 and moses sent them from the waste land of paran as the lord gave orders all of them men who were heads of the children of israel
 and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur
 of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori
 of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh
 of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph
 of the tribe of ephraim hoshea the son of nun
 of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu
 of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi
 of the tribe of joseph that is of the family of manasseh gaddi the son of susi
 of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli
 of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael
 of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi
 of the tribe of gad gevel the son of machi
 these are the names of the men whom moses sent to get knowledge about the land and moses gave to hoshea the son of nun the name of joshua
 so moses sent them to have a look at the land of canaan and said to them go up into the south and into the hill country
 and see what the land is like and if the people living in it are strong or feeble small or great in number
 and what sort of land they are living in if it is good or bad and what their living places are tent circles or walled towns
 and if the land is fertile or poor and if there is wood in it or not and be of good heart and come back with some of the produce of the land now it was the time when the first grapes were ready
 so they went up and got a view of the land from the waste land of zin to rehob on the way to hamath
 they went up into the south and came to hebron and ahiman and sheshai and talmai the children of anak were living there  now the building of hebron took place seven years before that of zoan in egypt 
 and they came to the valley of eshcol and cutting down a vine branch with its grapes two of them took it on a rod between them and they took some pomegranates and figs
 that place was named the valley of eshcol because of the grapes which the children of israel took from there
 at the end of forty days they came back from viewing the land
 and they came back to moses and aaron and all the children of israel to kadesh in the waste land of paran and gave an account to them and to all the people and let them see the produce of the land
 and they said we came to the land where you sent us and truly it is flowing with milk and honey and here is some of the produce of it
 but the people living in the land are strong and the towns are walled and very great further we saw the children of anak there
 and the amalekites are in the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites are living in the hill country and the canaanites by the sea and by the side of jordan
 then caleb made signs to the people to keep quiet and said to moses let us go up straight away and take this land for we are well able to overcome it
 but the men who had gone up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we
 and they gave the children of israel a bad account of the land they had been to see saying this land through which we went is a land causing destruction to those living in it and all the people we saw there are men of more than common size
 there we saw those great men the sons of anak offspring of the nephilim and we seemed to ourselves no more than insects and so we seemed to them
 then all the people gave load cries of grief and all that night they gave themselves up to weeping
 and all the children of israel crying out against moses and aaron said if only we had come to our death in the land of egypt or even in this waste land 
 why is the lord taking us into this land to come to our death by the sword our wives and our little ones will get into strange hands would it not be better for us to go back to egypt
 and they said to one another let us make a captain over us and go back to egypt
 then moses and aaron went down on their faces before the meeting of the people
 and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh two of those who had been to see the land giving signs of grief
 said to all the children of israel this land which we went through to see is a very good land
 and if the lord has delight in us he will take us into this land and give it to us a land flowing with milk and honey
 only do not go against the lord or go in fear of the people of the land for they will be our food their strength has been taken from them and the lord is with us have no fear of them
 but all the people said they were to be stoned then the glory of the lord was seen in the tent of meeting before the eyes of all the children of israel
 and the lord said to moses how long will this people have no respect for me how long will they be without faith in the face of all the signs i have done among them
 i will send disease on them for their destruction and take away their heritage and i will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they
 and moses said to the lord then it will come to the ears of the egyptians for by your power you took this people out from among them
 and they will give the news to the people of this land they have had word that you lord are present with this people letting yourself be seen face to face and that your cloud is resting over them and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night
 now if you put to death all this people as one man then the nations who have had word of your glory will say
 because the lord was not able to take this people into the land which he made an oath to give them he sent destruction on them in the waste land
 so now may my prayer come before you and let the power of the lord be great as you said
 the lord is slow to wrath and great in mercy overlooking wrongdoing and evil and will not let wrongdoers go free sending punishment on children for the sins of their fathers to the third and fourth generation
 may the sin of this people have forgiveness in the measure of your great mercy as you have had mercy on them from egypt up till now
 and the lord said i have had mercy as you say
 but truly as i am living and as all the earth will be full of the glory of the lord
 because all these men having seen my glory and the signs which i have done in egypt and in the waste land still have put me to the test ten times and have not given ear to my voice
 they will not see the land about which i made an oath to their fathers not one of these by whom i have not been honoured will see it
 but my servant caleb because he had a different spirit in him and has been true to me with all his heart him i will take into that land into which he went and his seed will have it for their heritage
 now the amalekites and the canaanites are in the valley tomorrow turning round go into the waste land by the way to the red sea
 then the lord said to moses and aaron
 how long am i to put up with this evil people and their outcries against me the words which they say against me have come to my ears
 say to them by my life says the lord as certainly as your words have come to my ears so certainly will i do this to you
 your dead bodies will be stretched out in this waste land and of all your number all those of twenty years old and over who have been crying out against me
 not one will come into the land which i gave my word you would have for your resting place but only caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun
 and your little ones whom you said would come into strange hands i will take in and they will see the land which you would not have
 but as for you your dead bodies will be stretched in this waste land
 and your children will be wanderers in the waste land for forty years undergoing punishment for your false ways till your bodies become dust in the waste land
 and as you went through the land viewing it for forty days so for forty years a year for every day you will undergo punishment for your wrongdoing and you will see that i am against you
 i the lord have said it and this i will certainly do to all this evil people who have come together against me in this waste land destruction will come on them and death will be their fate
 and the men whom moses sent to see the land and who by the bad account they gave of the land were the cause of the outcry the people made against moses
 those same men who said evil of the land came to their death by disease before the lord
 but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh of those who went to see the land were not touched by disease
 and when moses put these words before the children of israel the people were full of grief
 and early in the morning they got up and went to the top of the mountain saying we are here and we will go up to the place which the lord said he would give us for we have done wrong
 and moses said why are you now acting against the lords order seeing that no good will come of it
 go not up for the lord is not with you and you will be overcome by those who are fighting against you
 for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and you will be put to death by their swords because you have gone back from the way of the lord the lord will not be with you
 but they gave no attention to his words and went to the top of the mountain though moses and the ark of the lords agreement did not go out of the tent circle
 then the amalekites came down and the canaanites who were living in the hill country and overcame them completely driving them back as far as hormah
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel when you have come into the land which i am giving to you for your resting place
 and are going to make an offering by fire to the lord a burned offering or an offering in connection with an oath or an offering freely given or at your regular feasts an offering for a sweet smell to the lord from the herd or the flock
 then let him who is making his offering give to the lord a meal offering of a tenth part of a measure of the best meal mixed with a fourth part of a hin of oil
 and for the drink offering you are to give with the burned offering or other offering the fourth part of a hin of wine for every lamb
 or for a male sheep give as a meal offering two tenth parts of a measure of the best meal mixed with a third part of a hin of oil
 and for the drink offering give a third part of a hin of wine for a sweet smell to the lord
 and when you make ready a young ox for a burned or other offering or for the effecting of an oath or for peace offerings to the lord
 then with the ox give a meal offering of three tenth parts of a measure of the best meal mixed with half a hin of oil
 and for the drink offering give half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire for a sweet smell to the lord
 this is to be done for every young ox and for every male sheep or he lamb or young goat
 whatever number you make ready so you are to do for every one
 all those who are israelites by birth are to do these things in this way when giving an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the lord
 and if a man from another country or any other person living among you through all your generations has the desire to give an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the lord let him do as you do
 there is to be one law for you and for the man of another country living with you one law for ever from generation to generation as you are so is he to be before the lord
 the law and the rule are to be the same for you and for those from other lands living with you
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel when you come into the land where i am guiding you
 then when you take for your food the produce of the land you are to give an offering lifted up before the lord
 of the first of your rough meal you are to give a cake for a lifted offering lifting it up before the lord as the offering of the grain floor is lifted up
 from generation to generation you are to give to the lord a lifted offering from the first of your rough meal
 and if in error you go against any of these laws which the lord has given to moses
 all the laws which the lord has given you by the hand of moses from the day when the lord gave them and ever after from generation to generation
 then if the wrong is done in error without the knowledge of the meeting of the people let all the meeting give a young ox as a burned offering a sweet smell to the lord with its meal offering and its drink offering as is ordered in the law together with a he goat for a sin offering
 so the priest will make the people free from sin and they will have forgiveness for it was an error and they have given their offering made by fire to the lord and their sin offering before the lord on account of their error
 and all the meeting of the children of israel as well as those from other lands living among them will have forgiveness for it was an error on the part of the people
 and if one person does wrong without being conscious of it then let him give a she goat of the first year for a sin offering
 and the priest will take away the sin of the person who has done wrong if the wrong was done unconsciously and he will have forgiveness
 the law in connection with wrong done unconsciously is to be the same for him who is an israelite by birth and for the man from another country who is living among them
 but the person who does wrong in the pride of his heart if he is one of you or of another nation by birth is acting without respect for the lord and will be cut off from his people
 because he had no respect for the word of the lord and did not keep his law that man will be cut off without mercy and his sin will be on him
 now while the children of israel were in the waste land they saw a man who was getting sticks on the sabbath day
 and those who saw him getting sticks took him before moses and aaron and all the people
 and they had him shut up because they had no directions about what was to be done with him
 then the lord said to moses certainly the man is to be put to death let him be stoned by all the people outside the tent circle
 so all the people took him outside the tent circle and he was stoned to death there as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel that through all their generations they are to put on the edges of their robes an ornament of twisted threads and in every ornament a blue cord
 so that looking on these ornaments you may keep in mind the orders of the lord and do them and not be guided by the desires of your hearts and eyes through which you have been untrue to me
 and that you may keep in mind all my orders and do them and be holy to your god
 i am the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt so that i might be your god i am the lord your god
 now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi with dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of pallu the son of reuben made themselves ready
 and came before moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty chiefs of the people men of good name who had a place in the meeting of the people
 they came together against moses and against aaron and said to them you take overmuch on yourselves seeing that all the people are holy every one of them and the lord is among them why then have you put yourselves in authority over the people of the lord
 and moses hearing this went down on his face
 and he said to korah and his band in the morning the lord will make clear who are his and who is holy and who may come near him the man of his selection will be caused to come near him
 so do this let korah and all his band take vessels for burning perfumes
 and put spices on the fire in them before the lord tomorrow then the man marked out by the lord will be holy you take overmuch on yourselves you sons of levi
 and moses said to korah give ear now you sons of levi
 does it seem only a small thing to you that the god of israel has made you separate from the rest of israel letting you come near himself to do the work of the house of the lord and to take your place before the people to do what has to be done for them
 letting you and all your brothers the sons of levi come near to him and would you now be priests
 so you and all your band have come together against the lord and aaron who is he that you are crying out against him
 then moses sent for dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and they said we will not come up
 is it not enough that you have taken us from a land flowing with milk and honey to put us to death in the waste land but now you are desiring to make yourself a chief over us
 and more than this you have not taken us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us a heritage of fields and vine gardens will you put out the eyes of these men we will not come up
 then moses was very angry and said to the lord give no attention to their offering not one of their asses have i taken or done wrong to any of them
 and moses said to korah you and all your band are to come before the lord tomorrow you and they and aaron
 and let every man take a vessel for burning perfumes and put sweet spices in them let every man take his vessel before the lord two hundred and fifty vessels you and aaron and everyone with his vessel
 so every man took his vessel and they put fire in them with spices and came to the door of the tent of meeting with moses and aaron
 and korah made all the people come together against them to the door of the tent of meeting and the glory of the lord was seen by all the people
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 come out from among this people so that i may send sudden destruction on them
 then falling down on their faces they said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh because of one mans sin will your wrath be moved against all the people
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the people come away from the tent of korah dathan and abiram
 so moses got up and went to dathan and abiram and the responsible men of israel went with him
 and he said to the people come away now from the tents of these evil men without touching anything of theirs or you may be taken in the punishment of their sins
 so on every side they went away from the tent of korah dathan and abiram and dathan and abiram came out to the door of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little ones
 and moses said now you will see that the lord has sent me to do all these works and i have not done them of myself
 if these men have the common death of men or if the natural fate of all men overtakes them then the lord has not sent me
 but if the lord does something new opening the earth to take them in with everything which is theirs and they go down living into the underworld then it will be clear to you that the lord has not been honoured by these men
 and while these words were on his lips the earth under them was parted in two
 and the earth opening her mouth took them in with their families and all the men who were joined to korah and their goods
 so they and all theirs went down living into the underworld and the earth was shut over them and they were cut off from among the meeting of the people
 and all israel round about them went in flight at their cry for fear said they that we go down into the heart of the earth
 then fire came out from the lord burning up the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the perfume
 and the lord said to moses
 say to eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he is to take out of the flames the vessels with the perfumes in them turning the fire out of them for they are holy
 and let the vessels of those men who with their lives have made payment for their sin be hammered out into plates as a cover for the altar for they have been offered before the lord and are holy so that they may be a sign to the children of israel
 so eleazar the priest took the brass vessels which had been offered by those who were burned up and they were hammered out to make a cover for the altar
 to be a sign kept in memory for ever by the children of israel that no man who is not of the seed of aaron has the right of burning spices before the lord so that he may not be like korah and his band as the lord said to him by the mouth of moses
 but on the day after all the children of israel made an outcry against moses and against aaron saying you have put to death the lords people
 now when the people had come together against moses and aaron looking in the direction of the tent of meeting they saw the cloud covering it and the glory of the lord came before their eyes
 then moses and aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting
 and the lord said to moses
 come out from among this people so that i may send sudden destruction on them and they went down on their faces
 and moses said to aaron take your vessel and put in it fire from the altar and sweet spices and take it quickly into the meeting of the people and make them free from sin for wrath has gone out from the lord and the disease is starting
 and at the words of moses aaron took his vessel and went running among the people and even then the disease had made a start among them and he put spices in his vessel to take away the sin of the people
 and he took his place between the dead and the living and the disease was stopped
 now fourteen thousand seven hundred deaths were caused by that disease in addition to those who came to their end because of what korah had done
 then aaron went back to moses to the door of the tent of meeting and the disease came to a stop
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel that they are to give you rods one for every family for every chief the head of his fathers house making twelve rods let every mans name be placed on his rod
 and let aarons name be placed on the rod of levi for there is to be one rod for the head of every family
 and let them be stored up in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of witness where i come to you
 and the rod of that man who is marked out by me for myself will have buds on it so i will put a stop to the outcries which the children of israel make to me against you
 so moses gave these orders to the children of israel and all their chiefs gave him rods one for the head of every family making twelve rods and aarons rod was among them
 and moses put the rods before the lord in the tent of witness
 now on the day after moses went into the tent of witness and he saw that aarons rod the rod of the house of levi had put out buds and was covered with buds and flowers and fruit
 then moses took out all the rods from before the lord and gave them back to the children of israel and they saw them and every man took his rod
 and the lord said to moses put aarons rod back in front of the ark of witness to be kept for a sign against this false hearted people so that you may put a stop to their outcries against me and death may not overtake them
 this moses did as the lord gave orders so he did
 and the children of israel said to moses truly destruction has come on us an evil fate has overtaken us all
 death will overtake everyone who comes near who comes near the house of the lord are we all to come to destruction
 and the lord said to aaron you and your sons and your fathers family are to be responsible for all wrongdoing in relation to the holy place and you and your sons are to be responsible for the errors which come about in your work as priests
 let your brothers the family of levi come near with you so that they may be joined with you and be your servants but you and your sons with you are to go in before the ark of witness
 they are to do your orders and be responsible for the work of the tent but they may not come near the vessels of the holy place or the altar so that death may not overtake them or you
 they are to be joined with you in the care of the tent of meeting doing whatever is needed for the tent and no one of any other family may come near you
 you are to be responsible for the holy place and the altar so that wrath may never again come on the children of israel
 now see i have taken your brothers the levites from among the children of israel they are given to you and to the lord to do the work of the tent of meeting
 and you and your sons with you are to be responsible as priests for the altar and everything on it and everything inside the veil you are to do the work of priests i have given you your position as priests and any other man who comes near will be put to death
 and the lord said to aaron see i have given into your care my lifted offerings even all the holy things of the children of israel i have given to you and to your sons as your right for ever because you have been marked with the holy oil
 this is to be yours of the most holy things out of the fire offerings every offering of theirs every meal offering and sin offering and every offering which they make on account of error is to be most holy for you and your sons
 as most holy things they are to be your food let every male have them for food it is to be holy to you
 and this is yours the lifted offering which they give and all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters as your right for ever everyone in your house who is clean may have them for food
 all the best of the oil and the wine and the grain the first fruits of them which they give to the lord to you have i given them
 the earliest produce from their land which they take to the lord is to be yours everyone in your house who is clean may have it for his food
 everything given by oath to the lord in israel is to be yours
 the first birth of every living thing which is offered to the lord of man or beast is to be yours but for the first sons of man payment is to be made and for the first young of unclean beasts
 payment is to be made for these when they are a month old at the value fixed by you a price of five shekels by the scale of the holy place that is twenty gerahs to the shekel
 but no such payment may be made for the first birth of an ox or a sheep or a goat these are holy their blood is to be dropped on the altar and their fat burned for an offering made by fire a sweet smell to the lord
 their flesh is to be yours like the breast of the wave offering and the right leg it is to be yours
 all the lifted offerings of the holy things which the children of israel give to the lord i have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters as a right for ever this is an agreement made with salt before the lord to you and to your seed for ever
 and the lord said to aaron you will have no heritage in their land or any part among them i am your part and your heritage among the children of israel
 and to the children of levi i have given as their heritage all the tenths offered in israel as payment for the work they do the work of the tent of meeting
 in future the children of israel are not to come near the tent of meeting so that death may not come to them because of sin
 but the levites are to do the work of the tent of meeting and be responsible for errors in connection with it this is a law for ever through all your generations and among the children of israel they will have no heritage
 for the tenths which the children of israel give as a lifted offering to the lord i have given to the levites as their heritage and so i have said to them among the children of israel they will have no heritage
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the levites when you take from the children of israel the tenth which i have given to you from them as your heritage a tenth part of that tenth is to be offered as an offering lifted up before the lord
 and this lifted offering is to be put to your credit as if it was grain from the grain floor and wine from the vines
 so you are to make an offering lifted up to the lord from all the tenths which you get from the children of israel giving out of it the lords lifted offering to aaron the priest
 from everything given to you let the best of it the holy part of it be offered as a lifted offering to the lord
 say to them then when the best of it is lifted up on high it is to be put to the account of the levites as the increase of the grain floor and of the place where the grapes are crushed
 it is to be your food for you and your families in every place it is your reward for your work in the tent of meeting
 and no sin will be yours on account of it when the best of it has been lifted up on high you are not to make a wrong use of the holy things of the children of israel so that death may not overtake you
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 this is the rule of the law which the lord has made saying give orders to the children of israel to give you a red cow without any mark on her and on which the yoke has never been put
 give her to eleazar the priest and let him take her outside the tent circle and have her put to death before him
 then let eleazar the priest take some of her blood on his finger shaking the blood seven times in the direction of the front of the tent of meeting
 and the cow is to be burned before him her skin and her flesh and her blood and her waste are to be burned
 then let the priest take cedar wood and hyssop and red thread and put them into the fire where the cow is burning
 and the priest after washing his clothing and bathing his body in water may come back to the tent circle and will be unclean till evening
 and he who does the burning is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and be unclean till evening
 then let a man who is clean take the dust of the burned cow and put it outside the tent circle in a clean place where it is to be kept for the children of israel and used in making the water which takes away what is unclean it is a sin offering
 and he who takes up the dust of the burned cow is to have his clothing washed with water and be unclean till evening this is to be a law for ever for the children of israel as well as for the man from another country who is living among them
 anyone touching a dead body will be unclean for seven days
 on the third day and on the seventh day he is to make himself clean with the water and so he will be clean but if he does not do this on the third day and on the seventh day he will not be clean
 anyone touching the body of a dead man without making himself clean in this way makes the house of the lord unclean and that man will be cut off from israel because the water was not put on him he will be unclean his unclean condition is unchanged
 this is the law when death comes to a man in his tent everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent will be unclean for seven days
 and every open vessel without a cover fixed on it will be unclean
 and anyone touching one who has been put to death with the sword in the open country or the body of one who has come to his end by a natural death or a mans bone or the resting place of a dead body will be unclean for seven days
 and for the unclean they are to take the dust of the burning of the sin offering and put flowing water on it in a vessel
 and a clean person is to take hyssop and put it in the water shaking it over the tent and all the vessels and the people who were there and over him by whom the bone or the body of one who has been put to death with the sword or the body of one who has come to his end by a natural death or the resting place was touched
 let the clean person do this to the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he is to make him clean and after washing his clothing and bathing himself in water he will be clean in the evening
 but the man who being unclean does not make himself clean in this way will be cut off from the meeting of the people because he has made the holy place of the lord unclean the water has not been put on him he is unclean
 this is to be a law for them for ever he who puts the water on the unclean person is to have his clothing washed and anyone touching the water will be unclean till evening
 anything touched by the unclean person will be unclean and any person touching it will be unclean till evening
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 the children of israel are to put up their tents in the order of their families by the flags of their fathers houses facing the tent of meeting on every side
 those whose tents are on the east side looking to the dawn will be round the flag of the children of judah with nahshon the son of amminadab as their chief
 the number of his army was seventy four thousand six hundred
 and nearest to him will be the tribe of issachar with nethanel the son of zuar as their chief
 the number of his army was fifty four thousand four hundred
 after him the tribe of zebulun with eliab the son of helon as their chief
 the number of his army was fifty seven thousand four hundred
 the number of all the armies of judah was a hundred and eighty six thousand four hundred they go forward first
 on the south side is the flag of the children of reuben in the order of their armies with elizur the son of shedeur as their chief
 the number of his army was forty six thousand five hundred
 and nearest to him the tribe of simeon with shelumiel the son of zurishaddai as their chief
 the number of his army was fifty nine thousand three hundred
 then the tribe of gad with eliasaph son of reuel as their chief
 the number of his army was forty five thousand six hundred and fifty
 the number of all the armies of reuben together came to a hundred and fifty one thousand four hundred and fifty they go forward second
 then the tent of meeting is to go forward with the tents of the levites in the middle of the armies in the same order as their tents are placed they are to go forward every man under his flag
 on the west side will be the flag of the children of ephraim with elishama the son of ammihud as their chief
 the number of his army was forty thousand five hundred
 and by him the tribe of manasseh with gamaliel the son of pedahzur as their chief
 the number of his army was thirty two thousand two hundred
 then the tribe of benjamin with abidan the son of gideoni as their chief
 the number of his army was thirty five thousand four hundred
 the number of all the armies of ephraim was a hundred and eight thousand one hundred they go forward third
 on the north side will be the flag of the children of dan with ahiezer the son of ammishaddai as their chief
 the number of his army was sixty two thousand seven hundred
 nearest to him will be the tribe of asher with pagiel the son of ochran as their chief
 the number of his army was forty one thousand five hundred
 then the tribe of naphtali with ahira the son of enan as their chief
 the number of his army was fifty three thousand four hundred
 the number of all the armies in the tents of dan was a hundred and fifty seven thousand six hundred they will go forward last by their flags
 these are all who were numbered of the children of israel in the order of their fathers families all the armies in their tents together came to six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty
 but the levites were not numbered among the children of israel as the lord said to moses
 so the children of israel did as the lord said to moses so they put up their tents by their flags and they went forward in the same order by their families and by their fathers houses
 in the first month all the children of israel came into the waste land of zin and put up their tents in kadesh there death came to miriam and they put her body to rest in the earth
 and there was no water for the people and they came together against moses and against aaron
 and the people were angry with moses and said if only death had overtaken us when our brothers came to their death before the lord 
 why have you taken the lords people into this waste for death to come to us and to our cattle there
 why have you made us come out of egypt into this evil place this is no place of seed or figs or vines or other fruits and there is no water for drinking
 then moses and aaron went away from the people to the door of the tent of meeting and falling on their faces there they saw the glory of the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 take the rod you and aaron your brother and make all the people come together and before their eyes give orders to the rock to give out its water and so make water come out of the rock for them and give the people and their cattle drink
 and moses took the rod from before the lord as he gave him orders
 then moses and aaron made the people come together in front of the rock and he said to them give ear now you people whose hearts are turned from the lord are we to get water for you out of the rock
 and lifting up his hand moses gave the rock two blows with his rod and water came streaming out and the people and their cattle had drink enough
 then the lord said to moses and aaron because you had not enough faith in me to keep my name holy before the children of israel you will not take this people into the land which i have given them
 these are the waters of meribah because the children of israel went against the lord and they saw that he was holy among them
 then moses sent men from kadesh to the king of edom to say to him your brother israel says you have knowledge of all the things we have been through
 how our fathers went down into egypt and we were living in egypt for a long time and the egyptians were cruel to us and to our fathers
 and the lord gave ear to the voice of our cry and sent an angel and took us out of egypt and now we are in kadesh a town on the edge of your land
 let us now go through your land we will not go into field or vine garden or take the water of the springs we will go by the highway not turning to the right or to the left till we have gone past the limits of your land
 and edom said you are not to go through my land for if you do i will come out against you with the sword
 and the children of israel said to him we will go up by the highway and if we or our cattle take of your water we will give you a price for it only let us go through on our feet nothing more
 but he said you are not to go through and edom came out against them in his strength with a great army
 so edom would not let israel go through his land and israel went in another direction
 and they went on from kadesh and came with all their people to mount hor
 and at mount hor at the edge of the land of edom the lord said to moses and aaron
 aaron will be put to rest with his people he will not go into the land which i have given to the children of israel because you went against my word at the waters of meribah
 so take aaron and eleazar his son up into mount hor
 and take aarons robes off him and put them on eleazar his son and death will come to aaron there and he will be put to rest with his people
 so moses did as the lord had said and before the eyes of all the people they went up mount hor
 and moses took off aarons robes and put them on eleazar his son and there on the top of the mountain death came to aaron then moses and eleazar came down from the mountain
 and when the people saw that aaron was dead all the children of israel gave themselves up to weeping for him for thirty days
 and it came to the ears of the canaanite the king of arad living in the south that israel was coming by the way of atharim and he came out against them and took some of them prisoners
 then israel made an oath to the lord and said if you will give up this people into my hands then i will send complete destruction on all their towns
 and the lord in answer to the voice of israel gave the canaanites up to them and they put them and their towns completely to destruction and that place was named hormah
 then they went on from mount hor by the way to the red sea going round the land of edom and the spirit of the people was overcome with weariness on the way
 and crying out against god and against moses they said why have you taken us out of egypt to come to our death in the waste land for there is no bread and no water and this poor bread is disgusting to us
 then the lord sent poison snakes among the people and their bites were a cause of death to numbers of the people of israel
 then the people came to moses and said we have done wrong in crying out against the lord and against you make prayer to the lord to take away the snakes from us so moses made prayer for the people
 and the lord said to moses make an image of a snake and put it on a rod and anyone who has been wounded by the snakes looking on it will be made well
 so moses made a snake of brass and put it on a rod and anyone who had a snakebite after looking on the snake of brass was made well
 then the children of israel went on and put up their tents in oboth
 and journeying on again from oboth they put up their tents in iye abarim in the waste land before moab looking east
 and moving on from there they put up their tents in the valley of zered
 from there they went on and put up their tents on the other side of the arnon which is on the waste land at the edge of the land of the amorites for the arnon is the line of division between moab and the amorites
 as it says in the book of the wars of the lord vaheb in suphah and the valley of the amon
 the slope of the valleys going down to the tents of ar and touching the edge of moab
 from there they went on to beer the water spring of which the lord said to moses make the people come together and i will give them water
 then israel gave voice to this song come up o water spring let us make a song to it
 the fountain made by the chiefs made deep by the great ones of the people with the law givers rod and with their sticks then from the waste land they went on to mattanah
 and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth
 and from bamoth to the valley in the open country of moab and to the top of pisgah looking over jeshimon
 and israel sent men to sihon king of the amorites saying
 let me go through your land we will not go into field or vine garden or take the water of the springs we will go by the highway till we have gone past the limits of your land
 and sihon would not let israel go through his land but got all his people together and went out against israel into the waste land as far as jahaz to make war on israel
 but israel overcame him and took all his land from the arnon to the jabbok as far as the country of the children of ammon for the country of the children of ammon was strongly armed
 and israel took all their towns living in heshbon and all the towns and small places of the amorites
 for heshbon was the town of sihon king of the amorites who had made war against an earlier king of moab and taken from him all his land as far as the arnon
 so the makers of wise sayings say come to heshbon building up the town of sihon and making it strong
 for a fire has gone out of heshbon a flame from the town of sihon for the destruction of ar in moab and the lords of the high places of the arnon
 sorrow is yours o moab  destruction is your fate o people of chemosh his sons have gone in flight and his daughters are prisoners in the hands of sihon king of the amorites
 they are wounded with our arrows destruction has come on heshbon even to dibon and we have made the land waste as far as nophah stretching out to medeba
 so israel put up their tents in the land of the amorites
 and moses sent men secretly to jazer and they took its towns driving out the amorites who were living there
 then turning they went up by the way of bashan and og king of bashan went out against them with all his people to the fight at edrei
 and the lord said to moses have no fear of him for i have given him up into your hands with all his people and his land do to him as you did to sihon king of the amorites at heshbon
 so they overcame him and his sons and his people driving them all out and they took his land for their heritage
 then the children of israel journeying on put up their tents in the lowlands of moab on the other side of jordan at jericho
 now balak the son of zippor saw what israel had done to the amorites
 and in moab there was great fear of the people because their numbers were so great and the feeling of moab was bitter against the children of israel
 then moab said to the responsible men of midian it is clear that this great people will be the destruction of everything round us making a meal of us as the ox does of the grass of the field at that time balak the son of zippor was king of moab
 so he sent men to balaam son of beor at pethor by the river in the land of the children of his people saying to him see a people has come out of egypt covering all the face of the earth and they have put up their tents opposite to me
 come now in answer to my prayer and put a curse on this people for they are greater than i and then i may be strong enough to overcome them and send them out of the land for it is clear that good comes to him who has your blessing but he on whom you put your curse is cursed
 so the responsible men of moab and midian went away taking in their hands rewards for the prophet and they came to balaam and said to him what balak had given them orders to say
 and he said to them take your rest here tonight and i will give you an answer after hearing what the lord says so the chiefs of moab kept there with balaam that night
 and god came to balaam and said who are these men with you
 and balaam said to god balak the son of zippor king of moab has sent them to me saying
 see the people who have come out of egypt are covering all the earth now put a curse on this people for me so that i may be able to make war on them driving them out of the land
 and god said to balaam you are not to go with them or put a curse on this people for they have my blessing
 in the morning balaam got up and said to the chiefs of balak go back to your land for the lord will not let me go with you
 so the chiefs of moab went back to balak and said balaam will not come with us
 so balak sent more chiefs greater in number and of higher position than the others
 and they came to balaam and said balak son of zippor says let nothing keep you from coming to me
 for i will give you a place of very great honour and whatever you say to me i will do so come in answer to my prayer and put a curse on this people
 but balaam in answer said to the servants of balak even if balak gave me his house full of silver and gold it would not be possible for me to do anything more or less than the orders of the lord my god
 so take your rest here this night till i have knowledge what more the lord has to say to me
 and that night god came to balaam and said to him if these men have come for you go with them but do only what i say to you
 so in the morning balaam got up and making his ass ready went with the chiefs of moab
 but god was moved to wrath because he went and the angel of the lord took up a position in the road to keep him from his purpose now he was seated on his ass and his two servants were with him
 and the ass saw the angel of the lord waiting in the road with his sword in his hand and turning from the road the ass went into the field and balaam gave the ass blows to get her back on to the road
 then the angel of the lord took up his position in a narrow road through the vine gardens with a wall on this side and on that
 and the ass saw the angel of the lord and went near the wall crushing balaams foot against the wall and he gave her more blows
 then the angel of the lord went further stopping in a narrow place where there was no room for turning to the right or to the left
 and the ass saw the angel of the lord and went down on the earth under balaam and full of wrath balaam gave her hard blows with his stick
 then the lord gave the ass the power of talking and opening her mouth she said to balaam what have i done to you that you have given me blows these three times
 and balaam said to the ass you have made me seem foolish if only i had a sword in my hand i would put you to death
 and the ass said to balaam am i not your ass upon which you have gone all your life till this day and have i ever done this to you before and he said no
 then the lord made balaams eyes open and he saw the angel of the lord in the way with his sword in his hand and he went down on his face to the earth
 and the angel of the lord said to him why have you given your ass blows these three times see i have come out against you to keep you back because your purpose is not pleasing to me
 and the ass saw me turning to one side from me three times if she had not gone to one side i would certainly have put you to death and kept her safe
 and balaam said to the angel of the lord i have done wrong for i did not see that you were in the way against me but now if it is evil in your eyes i will go back again
 and the angel of the lord said to balaam go with the men but say only what i give you to say then balaam went on with the chiefs of balak
 now balak hearing that balaam had come went to the chief town of moab on the edge of the arnon in the farthest part of the land for the purpose of meeting him
 and balak said to balaam did i not send to you requesting you with all my heart to come to me why did you not come am i not able to give you a place of honour
 then balaam said to balak now i have come to you but have i power to say anything only what god puts into my mouth may i say
 and balaam went with balak to kiriath huzoth
 and balak made offerings of oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and the chiefs who were with him
 and in the morning balak took balaam up to the high places of baal and from there he was able to see the outer limits of the people
 and balaam said to balak make me here seven altars and get ready seven oxen and seven male sheep
 and balak did as balaam had said and balak and balaam made an offering on every altar of an ox and a male sheep
 then balaam said to balak take your place by your burned offering and i will go and see if the lord comes to me and i will give you word of whatever he says to me and he went to an open place on a hill
 and god came to balaam and balaam said to him i have made ready seven altars offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
 and the lord put words in balaams mouth and said go back to balak and this is what you are to say
 so he went back to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with all the chiefs of moab
 and in the words which the lord had given him he said from aram balak has sent for me the king of moab from the mountains of the east come put curses on jacob for me and be angry with israel
 how may i put curses on him who is not cursed by god how may i be angry with him with whom the lord is not angry
 from the top of the rocks i see him looking down on him from the hills it is a people made separate not to be numbered among the nations
 who is able to take the measure of the dust of jacob or the number of the thousands of israel may my death be the death of the upright and my last end like his 
 then balak said to balaam what have you done to me i sent for you so that my haters might be cursed and see you have given them a blessing
 and in answer he said am i not ordered to say only what the lord puts into my mouth
 and balak said to him come with me now into another place from which you will not be able to see them all but only the outskirts of them and you will send curses on them from there
 so he took him into the country of zophim to the top of pisgah and there they made seven altars offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
 then he said to balak take your place here by your burned offering while i go over there to the lord
 and the lord came to balaam and put words in his mouth and said go back to balak and this is what you are to say
 so he came to him where he was waiting by his burned offering with the chiefs of moab by his side and balak said to him what has the lord said
 and in the words which the lord had given him he said up  balak and give ear give attention to me o son of zippor
 god is not a man to say what is false or the son of man that his purpose may be changed what he has said will he not do and will he not give effect to the words of his mouth
 see i have had orders to give blessing and he has given a blessing which i have no power to take away
 he has seen no evil in jacob or wrongdoing in israel the lord his god is with him and the glad cry of a king is among them
 it is god who has taken them out of egypt his horns are like those of the mountain ox
 no evil power has effect against jacob no secret arts against israel at the right time it will be said of jacob and of israel see what god has done 
 see israel comes up like a she lion lifting himself up like a lion he will take no rest till he has made a meal of those he has overcome drinking the blood of those he has put to death
 then balak said to balaam if you will not put a curse on them at all events do not give them a blessing
 but balaam in answer said to balak did i not say to you i may only do what the lord says
 then balak said to balaam come now i will take you to another place it may be that god will let you put a curse on them from there
 so balak took balaam to the top of peor looking down over the waste land
 and balaam said to balak make me seven altars here and get seven oxen and seven male sheep ready for me
 and balak did as balaam said offering an ox and a male sheep on every altar
 now when balaam saw that it was the lords pleasure to give his blessing to israel he did not as at other times make use of secret arts but turning his face to the waste land
 and lifting up his eyes he saw israel there with their tents in the order of their tribes and the spirit of god came on him
 and moved by the spirit he said these are the words of balaam son of beor the words of the man whose eyes are open
 he says whose ears are open to the words of god who has seen the vision of the ruler of all falling down but having his eyes open
 how fair are your tents o jacob your houses o israel 
 they are stretched out like valleys like gardens by the riverside like flowering trees planted by the lord like cedar trees by the waters
 peoples will be in fear before his strength his arm will be on great nations his king will be higher than agag and his kingdom made great in honour
 it is god who has taken him out of egypt his horns are like those of the mountain ox the nations warring against him will be his food their bones will be broken they will be wounded with his arrows
 he took his sleep stretched out like a lion and like a she lion by whom will his rest be broken may a blessing be on everyone who gives you blessing and a curse on everyone by whom you are cursed
 then balak was full of wrath against balaam and angrily waving his hands he said to balaam i sent for you so that those who are against me might be cursed but now see three times you have given them a blessing
 go back quickly to the place you came from it was my purpose to give you a place of honour but now the lord has kept you back from honour
 then balaam said to balak did i not say to the men you sent to me
 even if balak gave me his house full of silver and gold it would not be possible for me to go outside the orders of the lord doing good or evil at the impulse of my mind whatever the lord says i will say
 so now i will go back to my people but first let me make clear to you what this people will do to your people in days to come
 then he went on with his story and said these are the words of balaam the son of beor the words of him whose eyes are open
 he says whose ear is open to the words of god who has knowledge of the most high who has seen the vision of the ruler of all falling down and having his eyes open
 i see him but not now looking on him but not near a star will come out of jacob and a rod of authority out of israel sending destruction to the farthest limits of moab and on the head of all the sons of sheth
 edom will be his heritage and he will put an end to the last of the people of seir
 and israel will go on in strength and jacob will have rule over his haters
 then turning his eyes to amalek he went on with his story and said amalek was the first of the nations but his part will be destruction for ever
 and looking on the kenites he went on with his story and said strong is your living place and your secret place is safe in the rock
 but still the kenites will be wasted till asshur takes you away prisoner
 then he went on with his story and said but who may keep his life when god does this
 but ships will come from the direction of kittim troubling asshur and troubling eber and like the others their fate will be destruction
 then balaam got up and went back to his place and balak went away
 now when israel was living in shittim the people became false to the lord doing evil with the daughters of moab
 for they sent for the people to be present at the offerings made to their gods and the people took part in their feasts and gave honour to their gods
 so israel had relations with the women of moab in honour of the baal of peor and the lord was moved to wrath against israel
 then the lord said to moses take all the chiefs of the people hanging them up in the sun before the lord so that the wrath of the lord may be turned from israel
 so moses said to the judges of israel let everyone put to death those of his men who have had relations with the women of moab in honour of the baal of peor
 then one of the children of israel came to his brothers taking with him a woman of midian before the eyes of moses and all the meeting of the people while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting
 and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest seeing it got up from among the people and took a spear in his hand
 and went after the man of israel into the tent driving the spear through the two of them through the man of israel and through the stomach of the woman so the disease was stopped among the children of israel
 but twenty four thousand of them had come to their death by the disease
 and the lord said to moses
 through phinehas and because of his passion for my honour my wrath has been turned away from the children of israel so that i have not sent destruction on them all in my wrath
 so say to them that i will make with him an agreement of peace
 and by this agreement he and his sons after him have the right to be priests for ever because by his care for the honour of his god he took away the sin of the children of israel

 death overtook nadab and abihu when they made an offering of strange fire before the lord
 of these twenty three thousand males from one month old and over were numbered they were not numbered with the rest of the children of israel for they had no heritage among the children of israel
 all these were numbered by moses and eleazar the priest when the children of israel were numbered in the lowlands of moab by the jordan at jericho
 but among all these was not one of those numbered by moses and aaron the priest when the children of israel were numbered in the waste land of sinai
 for the lord had said of them death will certainly overtake them in the waste land and of them all only caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun were still living
 then the daughters of zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of manasseh the son of joseph came forward their names are mahlah noah and hoglah and milcah and tirzah
 they came before moses and eleazar the priest and the chiefs and all the people at the door of the tent of meeting and said
 death overtook our father in the waste land he was not among those who were banded together with korah against the lord but death came to him in his sin and he had no sons
 why is the name of our father to be taken away from among his family because he had no son give us a heritage among our fathers brothers
 so moses put their cause before the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 what the daughters of zelophehad say is right certainly you are to give them a heritage among their fathers brothers and let the property which would have been their fathers go to them
 and say to the children of israel if a man has no son at the time of his death let his heritage go to his daughter
 and if he has no daughter then give his heritage to his brothers
 and if he has no brothers then give his heritage to his fathers brothers
 and if his father has no brothers then give it to his nearest relation in the family as his heritage this is to be a decision made by law for the children of israel as the lord gave orders to moses
 and the lord said to moses go up into this mountain of abarim so that you may see the land which i have given to the children of israel
 and when you have seen it you will be put to rest with your people as your brother aaron was
 because in the waste land of zin when the people were angry you and he went against my word and did not keep my name holy before their eyes at the waters  these are the waters of meribah in kadesh in the waste land of zin 
 then moses said to the lord
 let the lord the god of the spirits of all flesh put a man at the head of this people
 to go out and come in before them and be their guide so that the people of the lord may not be like sheep without a keeper
 and the lord said to moses take joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and put your hand on him
 and take him before eleazar the priest and all the meeting of the people and give him his orders before their eyes
 and put your honour on him so that all the children of israel may be under his authority
 he will take his place before eleazar the priest so that he may get directions from the lord for him with the urim at his word they will go out and at his word they will come in he and all the children of israel

 so moses gave the children of israel all these directions as the lord had given him orders
 now these are the generations of aaron and moses in the day when the word of the lord came to moses on mount sinai
 these are the names of the sons of aaron nadab the oldest and abihu eleazar and ithamar
 these are the names of the sons of aaron the priests on whom the holy oil was put who were marked out as priests
 and nadab and abihu were put to death before the lord when they made an offering of strange fire before the lord in the waste land of sinai and they had no children and eleazar and ithamar did the work of priests before aaron their father
 and the lord said to moses
 make the tribe of levi come near and put them before aaron the priest to be his helpers
 in order that they may be responsible to him and to all israel for the care of the tent of meeting and to do the work of the house
 and they will have the care of all the vessels of the tent of meeting and will do for the children of israel all the necessary work of the house
 give the levites to aaron and his sons so that they may be his without question from among the children of israel
 and give orders that aaron and his sons are to keep their place as priests any strange person who comes near is to be put to death
 and the lord said to moses
 see i have taken the levites out of the children of israel to be mine in place of the first sons of the children of israel
 for all the first sons are mine on the day when i put to death all the first sons in the land of egypt i took for myself every first male birth of man and beast they are mine i am the lord
 and the lord said to moses in the waste land of sinai
 let all the children of levi be numbered by their families and their fathers houses let every male of a month old and over be numbered
 so moses did as the lord said numbering them as he had been ordered
 these were the sons of levi by name gershon and kohath and merari
 and these are the names of the sons of gershon by their families libni and shimei
 and the sons of kohath by their families amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel
 and the sons of merari by their families mahli and mushi these are the families of the levites in the order of their fathers houses
 from gershon come the libnites and the shimeites these are the families of the gershonites
 those who were numbered of them the males from one month old and over were seven thousand five hundred
 the tents of the gershonites are to be placed at the back of the house to the west
 the chief of the gershonites is eliasaph the son of lael
 in the tent of meeting the gershonites are to have the care of the house and the tent with its cover and the veil for the door of the tent of meeting
 and the hangings for the open space round the house and the altar and the curtain for its doorway and all the cords needed for its use
 from kohath come the amramites and the izharites and the hebronites and the uzzielites these are the families of the kohathites
 those who were numbered of them the males from one month old and over were eight thousand six hundred who were responsible for the care of the holy place
 the tents of the kohathites are to be placed on the south side of the house
 their chief is elizaphan the son of uzziel
 in their care are the ark and the table and the lights and the altars and all the vessels used in the holy place and the veil and all they are used for
 eleazar the son of aaron the priest will be head over all the levites and overseer of those responsible for the care of the holy place
 from merari come the mahlites and the mushites these are the families of merari
 those who were numbered of them the males of a month old and over were six thousand two hundred
 the chief of the families of merari was zuriel the son of abihail their tents are to be placed on the north side of the house
 and in their care are to be all the boards of the tent with their rods and pillars and bases and all the instruments and all they are used for
 and the pillars of the open space round it with their bases and nails and cords
 and those whose tents are to be placed on the east side of the house in front of the tent of meeting looking to the dawn are moses and aaron and his sons who will do the work of the holy place for the children of israel and any strange person who comes near will be put to death
 all the levites numbered by moses and aaron at the order of the lord all the males of one month old and over numbered in the order of their families were twenty two thousand
 and the lord said to moses let all the first male children be numbered and take the number of their names
 and give to me the levites  i am the lord  in place of the first sons of the children of israel and the cattle of the levites in place of the first births among the cattle of the children of israel
 so moses had all the first sons among the children of israel numbered as the lord said to him
 every first son from a month old and over was numbered by name and the number came to twenty two thousand two hundred and seventy three
 and the lord said to moses
 take the levites in place of all the first sons of the children of israel and the cattle of the levites in place of their cattle the levites are to be mine i am the lord
 and the price you have to give for the two hundred and seventy three first sons of the children of israel which are in addition to the number of the levites
 will be five shekels for every one by the scale of the holy place  the shekel is twenty gerahs 
 and this money the price of those over the number of the levites is to be given to aaron and his sons
 so moses took the money the price of those whose place had not been taken by the levites
 from the first sons of israel he took it a thousand three hundred and sixty five shekels by the scale of the holy place
 and he gave the money to aaron and his sons as the lord had said
 and moses said to the heads of the tribes of the children of israel this is the order of the lord
 when a man takes an oath to the lord or gives an undertaking having the force of an oath let him not go back from his word but let him do whatever he has said he will do
 if a woman being young and under the authority of her father takes an oath to the lord or gives an undertaking
 if her father hearing of her oath or the undertaking she has given says nothing to her then all her oaths and every undertaking she has given will have force
 but if her father hearing of it makes her take back her word then the oaths or the undertakings she has given will have no force and she will have forgiveness from the lord because her oath was broken by her father
 and if she is married to a husband at the time when she is under an oath or an undertaking given without thought
 if her husband hearing of it says nothing to her at the time then the oaths she made and the undertakings she gave will have force
 but if her husband hearing of it makes her take it back then the oath she made and the undertaking she gave without thought will have no force or effect and she will have the lords forgiveness
 but an oath made by a widow or one who is no longer married to her husband and every undertaking she has given will have force
 if she made an oath while she was under the authority of her husband
 and her husband hearing of it said nothing to her and did not put a stop to it then all her oaths and every undertaking she gave will have force
 but if her husband on hearing of it made them without force or effect then whatever she has said about her oaths or her undertaking has no force her husband has made them without effect and she will have the lords forgiveness
 every oath and every undertaking which she gives to keep herself from pleasure may be supported or broken by her husband
 but if the days go on and her husband says nothing whatever to her then he is giving the support of his authority to her oaths and undertakings because at the time of hearing them he said nothing to her
 but if at some time after hearing of them he makes them without force then he is responsible for her wrongdoing
 these are the laws which the lord gave moses in relation to a man and his wife or a father and a young daughter who is under his authority
 then the lord said to moses
 give the midianites punishment for the wrong they did to the children of israel and after that you will go to rest with your people
 so moses said to the people let men from among you be armed for war to put into effect against midian the lords punishment on them
 from every tribe of israel send a thousand to the war
 so from the thousands of israel a thousand were taken from every tribe twelve thousand men armed for war
 and moses sent them out to war a thousand from every tribe and with them phinehas the son of eleazar the priest taking in his hands the vessels of the holy place and the horns for sounding the note of war
 and they made war on midian as the lord gave orders to moses and they put to death every male
 they put the kings of midian to death with the rest evi and reken and zur and hur and reba the five kings of midian and balaam the son of beor they put to death with the sword
 the women of midian with their little ones the children of israel took prisoner and all their cattle and flocks and all their goods they took for themselves
 and after burning all their towns and all their tent circles
 they went away with the goods they had taken man and beast
 and the prisoners and the goods and everything they had taken they took to moses and eleazar the priest and the people of israel to the tent circle in the lowlands of moab by the jordan at jericho
 then moses and eleazar the priest and the chiefs of the people went out to them before they had come into the tent circle
 and moses was angry with the chiefs of the army the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who had come back from the war
 and moses said to them why have you kept all the women safe
 it was these who moved by balaam were the cause of israels sin against the lord in the question of peor because of which disease came on the people of the lord
 so now put every male child to death and every woman who has had sex relations with a man
 but all the female children who have had no sex relations with men you may keep for yourselves
 you yourselves will have to keep outside the tent circle for seven days anyone of you who has put any person to death or come near a dead body and on the third day and on the seventh day make yourselves and your prisoners clean
 and every bit of clothing and anything made of leather or goats hair or wood you are to make clean
 then eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had been to the fight this is the rule of the law which the lord has given to moses
 but gold and silver and brass and iron and tin and lead
 and anything which may be heated is to go through the fire and be made clean but in addition it is to be put in the water of cleaning and anything which may not go through the fire is to be put in the water
 and on the seventh day after washing your clothing you will be clean and then you may come into the tent circle
 and the lord said to moses
 get an account of everything which was taken in the war of man and of beast you and eleazar the priest and the heads of families of the people
 and let division be made of it into two parts one for the men of war who went out to the fight and one for all the people
 and from the men of war who went out let there be offered to the lord one out of every five hundred from the persons and from the oxen and asses and sheep
 take this from their part and give it to eleazar the priest as an offering to be lifted up to the lord
 and from the part given to the children of israel take one out of every fifty from the persons and from the oxen and asses and sheep and give it to the levites who have the care of the house of the lord
 so eleazar and moses did as the lord had given orders to moses
 now the beasts taken in addition to what the fighting men took for themselves were six hundred and seventy five thousand sheep
 and seventy two thousand oxen
 and sixty one thousand asses
 and thirty two thousand persons that is women who had never had sex relations with a man
 and the half given as their part to the men who went to the war was three hundred and thirty seven thousand five hundred sheep
 of which the lords part was six hundred and seventy five
 the number of oxen was thirty six thousand of which the lords part was seventy two
 the number of asses was thirty thousand five hundred of which the lords part was sixty one
 and the number of persons was sixteen thousand of which the lords part was thirty two persons
 and moses gave the lords part lifted up as an offering to eleazar the priest as the lord had given orders to moses
 and from the half given to the children of israel which moses had kept separate from that given to the fighting men
  now the peoples half was three hundred and thirty seven thousand five hundred sheep
 and thirty six thousand oxen
 and thirty thousand five hundred asses
 and sixteen thousand persons 
 even from the children of israels half moses took one out of every fifty men and beasts and gave them to the levites who had the care of the house of the lord as the lord gave orders to moses
 then the men in authority over the thousands of the army the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came to moses
 and said to him your servants have taken note of the number of all the fighting men under our orders and every one is present
 and we have here an offering for the lord from what every man took in the war ornaments of gold leg chains and arm rings finger rings ear rings and neck ornaments to make our souls free from sin before the lord
 so moses and eleazar the priest took the gold from them even all the worked ornaments
 and the gold which the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds gave as an offering to be lifted up before the lord came to sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
  for every man of the army had taken goods for himself in the war 
 then moses and eleazar the priest took the gold given by the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and took it into the tent of meeting to be a sign in memory of the children of israel before the lord
 now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a great number of cattle and when they saw that the land of jazer and the land of gilead was a good place for cattle
 the children of gad and the children of reuben came and said to moses and to eleazar the priest and to the chiefs of the meeting
 ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and sebam and nebo and beon
 the land which the lord gave into the hands of the children of israel is a land for cattle and your servants have cattle
 and they said with your approval let this land be given to your servants as their heritage do not take us over jordan
 and moses said to the children of gad and the children of reuben are your brothers to go to the war while you take your rest here
 why would you take from the children of israel the desire to go over into the land which the lord has given them
 so did your fathers when i sent them from kadesh barnea to see the land
 for when they went up to the valley of eshcol and saw the land they took from the children of israel the desire to go into the land which the lord had given them
 and at that time the lord was moved to wrath and made an oath saying
 truly not one of the men of twenty years old and over who came out of egypt will see the land which i gave by oath to abraham isaac and jacob because they have not been true to me with all their heart
 but only caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite and joshua the son of nun because they have been true to the lord
 then the lord was angry with israel and he made them wanderers in the waste land for forty years till all that generation who had done evil in the eyes of the lord was dead
 and now you have come to take the place of your fathers another generation of sinners increasing the wrath of the lord against israel
 for if you are turned away from him he will send them wandering again in the waste land and you will be the cause of the destruction of all this people
 then they came to him and said we will make safe places for our cattle here and towns for our little ones
 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of israel till we have taken them to their place but our little ones will be safe in the walled towns against the people of the land
 we will not come back to our houses till every one of the children of israel has come into his heritage
 for we will not have our heritage with them on the other side of jordan and forward because our heritage has come to us on this side of jordan to the east
 then moses said to them if you will do this arming yourselves to go before the lord to the war
 every armed man of you going across jordan before the lord till he has overcome and sent in flight all who are against him
 and the land is under the rule of the lord then after that you may come back having done no wrong to the lord and to israel and this land will be yours for your heritage before the lord
 but if you do not do this then you are sinners against the lord and you may be certain that your sin will have its reward
 so get to work building your towns for your little ones and safe places for your sheep and do as you have said
 and the children of gad and the children of reuben said to moses your servants will do as my lord says
 our little ones our wives and our flocks and all our cattle will be there in the towns of gilead
 but your servants will go over every man armed for war before the lord to the fight as my lord says
 so moses gave orders about them to eleazar the priest and to joshua the son of nun and to the heads of families of the tribes of the children of israel
 and moses said to them if the children of gad and the children of reuben go with you over jordan every man armed for the fight before the lord and all the land is given into your hands then let them have the land of gilead for a heritage
 but if they do not go over with you armed they will have to take their heritage with you in the land of canaan
 then the children of gad and the children of reuben said as the lord has said to your servants so will we do
 we will go over armed before the lord into the land of canaan and you will give us our heritage on this side of jordan
 so moses gave to them even to the children of gad and the children of reuben and to the half tribe of manasseh the son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan all the land with its towns and the country round them
 and the children of gad were the builders of dibon and ataroth and aroer
 and atroth shophan and jazer and jogbehah
 and beth nimrah and beth haran walled towns and shut in places for sheep
 and the children of reuben were the builders of heshbon and elealeh and kiriathaim
 and nebo and baal meon  their names being changed  and sibmah and they gave other names to the towns they made
 and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead and took it driving out the amorites who were living there
 and moses gave gilead to machir the son of manasseh and he made it his living place
 and jair the son of manasseh went and took the towns of gilead naming them havvoth jair
 and nobah went and took kenath and its small towns naming it nobah after himself
 these are the journeys of the children of israel when they went out of the land of egypt in their armies under the direction of moses and aaron
 and the stages of their journey on their way out were put down in writing by moses at the order of the lord these are the stages of their journey and the way they went
 on the fifteenth day of the first month they went out from rameses on the day after the passover the children of israel went out by the power of the lord before the eyes of all the egyptians
 while the egyptians were placing in the earth the bodies of their sons on whom the lord had sent destruction and their gods had been judged by him
 so the children of israel went from rameses and put up their tents in succoth
 and they went on from succoth and put up their tents in etham on the edge of the waste land
 and from etham turning back to pi hahiroth which is before baal zephon they put up their tents before migdol

 and they went on from rimmon perez and put up their tents in libnah
 and they went on from libnah and put up their tents in rissah
 and they went on from rissah and put up their tents in kehelathah
 and they went on from kehelathah and put up their tents in mount shepher
 and they went on from mount shepher and put up their tents in haradah
 and they went on from haradah and put up their tents in makheloth
 and they went on from makheloth and put up their tents in tahath
 and they went on from tahath and put up their tents in terah
 and they went on from terah and put up their tents in mithkah
 and they went on from mithkah and put up their tents in hashmonah
 and they went on from hashmonah and put up their tents in moseroth
 and they went on from moseroth and put up their tents in bene jaakan
 and they went on from bene jaakan and put up their tents in hor haggidgad
 and they went on from hor haggidgad and put up their tents in jotbathah
 and they went on from jotbathah and put up their tents in abronah
 and they went on from abronah and put up their tents in ezion geber
 and they went on from ezion geber and put up their tents in the waste land of zin  which is kadesh 
 and they went on from kadesh and put up their tents in mount hor on the edge of the land of edom
 and aaron the priest went up into the mountain at the order of the lord and came to his death there in the fortieth year after the children of israel had come out of the land of egypt in the fifth month on the first day of the month
 aaron was a hundred and twenty three years old at the time of his death in mount hor
 and news of the coming of the children of israel came to the king of arad the canaanite who was living in the south in the land of canaan
 and from mount hor they went on and put up their tents in zalmonah
 and they went on from zalmonah and put up their tents in punon
 and they went on from punon and put up their tents in oboth
 and they went on from oboth and put up their tents in iye abarim at the edge of moab
 and they went on from iyim and put up their tents in dibon gad
 and from dibon gad they went on and put up their tents in almon diblathaim
 and from almon diblathaim they went on and put up their tents in the mountains of abarim before nebo
 and they went on from the mountains of abarim and put up their tents in the lowlands of moab by jordan at jericho
 planting their tents by the side of jordan from beth jeshimoth as far as abel shittim in the lowlands of moab
 and in the lowlands of moab by jordan at jericho the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel when you go over jordan into the land of canaan
 see that all the people of the land are forced out from before you and put to destruction all their pictured stones and all their metal images and all their high places
 and take the land for yourselves for your resting place for to you i have given the land as your heritage
 and you will take up your heritage in the land by the decision of the lord to every family its part the greater the family the greater its heritage and the smaller the family the smaller will be its heritage wherever the decision of the lord gives to any man his part that will be his distribution will be made to you by your fathers tribes
 but if you are slow in driving out the people of the land then those of them who are still there will be like pin points in your eyes and like thorns in your sides troubling you in the land where you are living
 and it will come about that as it was my purpose to do to them so i will do to you
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to the children of israel and say to them when you come into the land of canaan  this is the land which is to be your heritage the land of canaan inside these limits 
 then your south quarter will be from the waste land of zin by the side of edom and your limit on the south will be from the east end of the salt sea
 and round to the south of the slope of akrabbim and on to zin and its direction will be south of kadesh barnea and it will go as far as hazar addar and on to azmon
 and from azmon it will go round to the stream of egypt as far as the sea
 and for your limit on the west you will have the great sea and its edge this will be your limit on the west
 and your limit on the north will be the line from the great sea to mount hor
 and from mount hor the line will go in the direction of hamath the farthest point of it will be at zedad
 and the limit will go on to ziphron with its farthest point at hazar enan this will be your limit on the north
 and on the east your limit will be marked out from hazar enan to shepham
 going down from shepham to riblah on the east side of ain and on as far as the east side of the sea of chinnereth
 and so down to jordan stretching to the salt sea all the land inside these limits will be yours
 and moses gave orders to the children of israel saying this is the land which is to be your heritage by the decision of the lord which by the lords order is to be given to the nine tribes and the half tribe
 for the tribe of the children of reuben by their fathers families and the tribe of the children of gad by their fathers families and the half tribe of manasseh have been given their heritage
 the two tribes and the half tribe have been given their heritage on the other side of jordan at jericho on the east looking to the dawn
 and the lord said to moses
 these are the names of the men who are to make the distribution of the land among you eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun
 and you are to take one chief from every tribe to make the distribution of the land
 and these are the names of the men of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh
 and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of ammihud
 of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon
 and of the tribe of the children of dan a chief bukki the son of jogli
 of the children of joseph of the tribe of the children of manasseh a chief hanniel the son of ephod
 and of the tribe of the children of ephraim a chief kemuel the son of shiphtan
 and of the tribe of the children of zebulun a chief elizaphan the son of parnach
 and of the tribe of the children of issachar a chief paltiel the son of azzan
 and of the tribe of the children of asher a chief ahihud the son of shelomi
 and of the tribe of the children of naphtali a chief pedahel the son of ammihud
 these are they to whom the lord gave orders to make the distribution of the heritage among the children of israel in the land of canaan
 and the lord said to moses in the lowlands of moab by jordan at jericho
 give orders to the children of israel to give to the levites from the heritage which is theirs towns for themselves with land on the outskirts of the towns
 these towns are to be their living places with land round them for their cattle and their food and all their beasts
 stretching from the wall of the towns a distance of a thousand cubits all round
 the measure of this space of land is to be two thousand cubits outside the town on the east and two thousand cubits on the south and on the west and on the north the town being in the middle this space will be the outskirts of their towns
 and the towns which you give the levites are to be the six safe places to which the taker of life may go in flight and in addition you are to give them forty two towns
 forty eight towns are to be given to the levites all with land round them
 and these towns are to be given out of the heritage of the children of israel taking the greater number from those who have much and a smaller number from those who have little everyone in the measure of his heritage is to give of his property to the levites
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel when you have gone over jordan into the land of canaan
 then let certain towns be marked out as safe places to which anyone who takes the life of another in error may go in flight
 in these towns you may be safe from him who has the right of punishment so that death may not overtake the taker of life till he has been judged by the meeting of the people
 six of the towns which you give will be such safe places
 three on the other side of jordan and three in the land of canaan to be safe places for flight
 for the children of israel and for the man from another country who is living among them these six towns are to be safe places where anyone causing the death of another through error may go in flight
 but if a man gives another man a blow with an iron instrument causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
 or if he gives him a blow with a stone in his hand causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
 or if he gave him blows with a wood instrument in his hands causing his death he is a taker of life and is certainly to be put to death
 he whose right it is to give punishment for blood may himself put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him
 if in his hate he put a sword through him or waiting secretly for him sent a spear or stone at him causing his death
 or in hate gave him blows with his hand causing death he who gave the death blow is to be put to death he is a taker of life he whose right it is to give punishment for blood may put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him
 but if a man has given a wound to another suddenly and not in hate or without design has sent something against him
 or has given him a blow with a stone without seeing him so causing his death though he had nothing against him and no desire to do him evil
 then let the meeting of the people be judge between the man responsible for the death and him who has the right of punishment for blood acting by these rules
 and let the people keep the man responsible for the death safe from the hands of him who has the right of punishment for blood and send him back to his safe town where he had gone in flight there let him be till the death of the high priest who was marked with the holy oil
 but if ever he goes outside the walls of the safe town where he had gone in flight
 and the giver of punishment meeting him outside the walls of the town puts him to death he will not be responsible for his blood
 because he had been ordered to keep inside the safe town till the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the taker of life may come back to the place of his heritage
 these rules are to be your guide in judging through all your generations wherever you may be living
 anyone causing the death of another is himself to be put to death on the word of witnesses but the word of one witness is not enough
 further no price may be given for the life of one who has taken life and whose right reward is death he is certainly to be put to death
 and no price may be offered for one who has gone in flight to a safe town for the purpose of letting him come back to his place before the death of the high priest
 so do not make the land where you are living unholy for blood makes the land unholy and there is no way of making the land free from the blood which has come on it but only by the death of him who was the cause of it
 do not make unclean the land where you are living and in which is my house for i the lord am present among the children of israel
 now the heads of the families of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came to moses the chiefs and the heads of families of the children of israel being present
 and said the lord gave orders to my lord to make distribution of the land as their heritage to the children of israel and my lord was ordered by the lord to give the heritage of zelophehad our brother to his daughters
 now if they get married to any of the sons of other tribes of the children of israel then their property will be taken away from the heritage of our fathers and become part of the heritage of the tribe into which they get married and their heritage will be taken away from the heritage of our tribe
 and at the time of the jubilee of the children of israel their property will be joined to the heritage of the tribe of which they are part and will be taken away from the heritage of the tribe of our fathers
 so by the direction of the lord moses gave orders to the children of israel saying what the tribe of the sons of joseph have said is right
 this is the order of the lord about the daughters of zelophehad the lord says let them take as their husbands whoever is most pleasing to them but only among the family of their fathers tribe
 and so no property will be handed from tribe to tribe among the children of israel but every one of the children of israel will keep the heritage of his fathers tribe
 and every daughter owning property in any tribe of the children of israel is to be married to one of the family of her fathers tribe so that every man of the children of israel may keep the heritage of his fathers
 and no property will be handed from one tribe to another but every tribe of the children of israel will keep its heritage
 so the daughters of zelophehad did as the lord gave orders to moses
 for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad took as their husbands the sons of their fathers brothers
 and were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their property was kept in the tribe of their fathers family
 these are the laws and the orders which the lord gave to the children of israel by moses in the lowlands of moab by jordan at jericho
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 let the sons of kohath from among the sons of levi be numbered by their families in the order of their fathers houses
 all those from thirty to fifty years old who are able to do the work of the tent of meeting
 and this is to be the work of the sons of kohath in connection with the most holy things
 when all the people go forward aaron is to go in with his sons and take down the veil of the curtain covering the ark of witness with it
 and putting over it the leather cover and over that a blue cloth and putting its rods in place
 and on the table of the holy bread they are to put a blue cloth and on it all the vessels the spoons and the basins and the cups and the holy bread with them
 and over them they are to put a red cloth covering it with a leather cover and putting its rods in their places
 and they are to take a blue cloth covering with it the light support with its lights and its instruments and its trays and all the oil vessels which are used for it
 all these they are to put in a leather cover and put it on the frame
 on the gold altar they are to put a blue cloth covering it with a leather cover and they are to put its rods in their places
 all the vessels which are used in the holy place they are to put in a blue cloth covering them with a leather cover and put them on the frame
 and they are to take away the burned waste from the altar and put a purple cloth on it
 placing on the cloth all its vessels the fire baskets the meat hooks the spades and the basins all the vessels of the altar they are to put a leather cover over all these and put its rods in their places
 and after the holy place and all its vessels have been covered up by aaron and his sons when the tents of the people go forward the sons of kohath are to come and take it up but the holy things may not be touched by them for fear of death
 and eleazar the son of aaron the priest is to be responsible for the oil for the light and the sweet perfumes for burning and the regular meal offering and the holy oil the house and the holy place and everything in it will be in his care
 and the lord said to moses and aaron
 do not let the family of the kohathites be cut off from among the levites
 but do this to them so that life and not death may be theirs when they come near the most holy things let aaron and his sons go in and give to every one his work and that which he is to take up
 but they themselves are not to go in to see the holy place even for a minute for fear of death
 and the lord said to moses
 let the sons of gershon be numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses
 all those from thirty to fifty years old who are able to do the work of the tent of meeting
 this is to be the work of the gershonites the things they are to do and take up
 they are to take up the curtains of the house and the tent of meeting with its cover and the leather cover over it and the hangings for the door of the tent of meeting
 and the hangings for the open space round the house and the altar and the curtain for its doorway with the cords and all the things used for them whatever is necessary for these they are to do
 from the mouth of aaron and his sons the gershonites will have word about all the things they are to do and take up you are to give them their orders
 this is the work of the family of the gershonites in the tent of meeting and they will be under the direction of ithamar the son of aaron the priest
 the sons of merari are to be numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses
 every one from thirty to fifty years old who is able to do the work of the tent of meeting
 and this is their part in the work of the tent of meeting the transport of the boards and the rods of the tent with the pillars and their bases
 and the pillars of the open space outside it with their bases and their nails and cords and all the instruments used and everything which has to be done there all the instruments for which they are responsible are to be numbered by name
 this is the work which the sons of merari are to do in connection with the tent of meeting under the direction of ithamar the son of aaron the priest
 so moses and aaron and the chiefs of the people took in hand the numbering of the sons of the kohathites by families in the order of their fathers houses
 numbering all those from thirty to fifty years old who were able to do the work in the tent of meeting
 and the number of all these was two thousand seven hundred and fifty
 this is the number of those of the kohathites who did the work in the tent of meeting as they were numbered by moses and aaron at the order of the lord
 and those of the sons of gershon who were numbered by families
 all those from thirty to fifty years old who were able to do the work in the tent of meeting
 who were numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses were two thousand six hundred and thirty
 this is the number of the sons of gershon who did the work in the tent of meeting as they were numbered by moses and aaron at the order of the lord
 and those of the sons of merari who were numbered by families in the order of their fathers houses
 all those from thirty to fifty years old who did the work in the tent of meeting
 who were numbered by families were three thousand two hundred
 this is the number of the sons of merari numbered by moses and aaron at the order of the lord
 and all the levites who were numbered by moses and aaron and the chiefs of the people by families in the order of their fathers houses
 those from thirty to fifty years old who were able to do the work of the tent of meeting and of its transport
 came to eight thousand five hundred and eighty
 at the order of the lord they were numbered by moses every one in relation to his work and to his part in the transport so they were numbered by moses at the order of the lord
 and the lord said to moses
 give orders to the children of israel to put outside the tent circle every leper and anyone who has any sort of flow from his body and anyone who is unclean from the touch of the dead
 male or female they are to be put outside the tent circle so that they may not make unclean my resting place among them
 so the children of israel did as the lord had said to moses and put them outside the tent circle
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if a man or a woman does any of the sins of men going against the word of the lord and is in the wrong
 let them say openly what they have done and make payment for the wrong done with the addition of a fifth part and give it to him to whom the wrong was done
 but if the man has no relation to whom the payment may be made then the payment for sin made to the lord will be the priests in addition to the sheep offered to take away his sin
 and every offering lifted up of all the holy things which the children of israel give to the priest will be his
 and every mans holy things will be his whatever a man gives to the priest will be his
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if any mans wife does wrong sinning against him
 by taking as her lover another man and keeps it secret so that her husband has no knowledge of it and there is no witness against her and she is not taken in the act
 if the spirit of doubt comes into her husbands heart and he has doubts of his wife with good cause or if he has doubts of her without cause
 then let him take her to the priest offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal without oil or perfume for it is a meal offering of a bitter spirit a meal offering keeping wrongdoing in mind
 and the priest will make her come near and put her before the lord
 and the priest will take holy water in a pot and put in it dust from the floor of the house
 and he will make the woman come before the lord with her hair loose and will put the meal offering the offering of a bitter spirit in her hands and the priest will take in his hand the bitter water causing the curse
 and he will make her take an oath and say to her if no man has been your lover and you have not been with another in place of your husband you are free from this bitter water causing the curse
 but if you have been with another in place of your husband and have made yourself unclean with a lover
 then the priest will put the oath of the curse on the woman and say to her may the lord make you a curse and an oath among your people sending on you wasting of the legs and disease of the stomach
 and this water of the curse will go into your body causing disease of your stomach and wasting of your legs and the woman will say so be it
 and the priest will put these curses in a book washing out the writing with the bitter water
 and he will give to the woman the bitter water for drink and the bitter water causing the curse will go into her
 and the priest will take from her hand the meal offering of doubt waving it before the lord and will take it to the altar
 and he will take some of it in his hand burning it on the altar as a sign and then he will give the woman the bitter water
 and it will be that if the woman has become unclean sinning against her husband when she has taken the bitter water it will go into her body causing disease of the stomach and wasting of the legs and she will be a curse among her people
 but if she is clean she will be free and will have offspring
 this is the law for testing a wife who goes with another in place of her husband and becomes unclean
 or for a husband who in a bitter spirit has doubts in his heart about his wife let him take her to the priest who will put in force this law
 then the man will be free from all wrong and the womans sin will be on her
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if a man or a woman takes an oath to keep himself separate and give himself to the lord
 he is to keep himself from wine and strong drink and take no mixed wine or strong drink or any drink made from grapes or any grapes green or dry
 all the time he is separate he may take nothing made from the grape vine from its seeds to its skin
 all the time he is under his oath let no blade come near his head till the days while he is separate are ended he is holy and his hair may not be cut
 all the time he is separate he may not come near any dead body
 he may not make himself unclean for his father or his mother his sister or his brother if death comes to them because he is under an oath to keep himself separate for god
 all the time he is separate he is holy to the lord
 if death comes suddenly to a man at his side so that he becomes unclean let his hair be cut off on the day when he is made clean on the seventh day
 and on the eighth day let him take to the priest at the door of the tent of meeting two doves or two young pigeons
 and the priest will give one for a sin offering and the other for a burned offering to take away the sin which came on him on account of the dead and he will make his head holy that same day
 and he will give to the lord his days of being separate offering a he lamb of the first year as an offering for error but the earlier days will be a loss because he became unclean
 and this is the law for him who is separate when the necessary days are ended he is to come to the door of the tent of meeting
 and make his offering to the lord one he lamb of the first year without a mark for a burned offering and one female lamb of the first year without a mark for a sin offering and one male sheep without a mark for peace offerings
 and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of the best meal mixed with oil and thin unleavened cakes covered with oil with their meal offering and drink offerings
 and the priest will take them before the lord and make his sin offering and his burned offering
 giving the sheep of the peace offerings with the basket of unleavened bread and at the same time the priest will make his meal offering and his drink offering
 then let his long hair the sign of his oath be cut off at the door of the tent of meeting and let him put it on the fire on which the peace offerings are burning
 and the priest will take the cooked leg of the sheep and one unleavened cake and one thin cake out of the basket and put them on the hands of the separate one after his hair has been cut
 waving them for a wave offering before the lord this is holy for the priest together with the waved breast and the leg which is lifted up after that the man may take wine
 this is the law for him who takes an oath to keep himself separate and for his offering to the lord on that account in addition to what he may be able to get this is the law of his oath which he will have to keep
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron and his sons these are the words of blessing which are to be used by you in blessing the children of israel say to them
 may the lord send his blessing on you and keep you
 may the light of the lords face be shining on you in grace
 may the lords approval be resting on you and may he give you peace
 so they will put my name on the children of israel and i will give them my blessing
 and when moses had put up the house completely and had put oil on it and made it holy with all the things in it and had made the altar and all its vessels holy with oil
 then the chiefs of israel the heads of their fathers houses made offerings these were the chiefs of the tribes who were over those who were numbered
 and they came with their offerings before the lord six covered carts and twelve oxen a cart for every two of the chiefs and for every one an ox
 and the lord said to moses
 take the things from them to be used for the work of the tent of meeting and give them to the levites to every man what is needed for his work
 so moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the levites
 two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of gershon for their work
 and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of merari for their work under the direction of ithamar the son of aaron the priest
 but to the sons of kohath he gave nothing because they had the care of the holy place taking it about on their backs

 and when moses went into the tent of meeting to have talk with him then the voice came to his ears from over the cover which was on the ark of witness from between the two winged ones and he had talk with him
 and the lord said to moses
 say to aaron when you put the lights in their places the seven lights will give light in front of the support
 and aaron did so he put the lights in their places so that they gave light in front of the support as the lord gave orders to moses
 the support for the lights was of hammered gold work from its base to its flowers it was of hammered work from the design which the lord had given to moses he made the support for the lights
 and the lord said to moses
 take the levites out from among the children of israel and make them clean
 and this is how you are to make them clean let the holy water which takes away sin be put on them and let the hair all over their bodies be cut off with a sharp blade and let their clothing be washed and their bodies made clean
 then let them take a young ox and its meal offering crushed grain mixed with oil and take another ox for a sin offering
 and make the levites come forward in front of the tent of meeting and let all the children of israel come together
 and you are to take the levites before the lord and the children of israel are to put their hands on them
 and aaron is to give the levites to the lord as a wave offering from the children of israel so that they may do the lords work
 and the levites are to put their hands on the heads of the oxen and one of the oxen is to be offered for a sin offering and the other for a burned offering to the lord to take away the sin of the levites
 then the levites are to be put before aaron and his sons to be offered as a wave offering to the lord
 so you are to make the levites separate from the children of israel and the levites will be mine
 after that the levites will go in to do whatever has to be done in the tent of meeting you are to make them clean and give them as a wave offering
 for they have been given to me from among the children of israel in place of every mothers first son the first to come to birth in israel i have taken them for myself
 for every mothers first son among the children of israel is mine the first male birth of man or beast on the day when i sent death on all the first sons in the land of egypt i made them mine
 and in place of the first sons among the children of israel i have taken the levites
 and i have given them to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to undertake for them all the work of the tent of meeting and to take away sin from the children of israel so that no evil may come on them when they come near the holy place
 all these things moses and aaron and the children of israel did to the levites as the lord gave orders to moses about the levites so the children of israel did
 and the levites were made clean from sin and their clothing was washed and aaron gave them for a wave offering before the lord and aaron took away their sin and made them clean
 and then the levites went in to do their work in the tent of meeting before aaron and his sons all the orders which the lord had given moses about the levites were put into effect
 and the lord said to moses
 this is the rule for the levites those of twenty five years old and over are to go in and do the work of the tent of meeting
 but after they are fifty years old they are to give up their work and do no more
 but be with their brothers in the tent of meeting taking care of it but doing no work this is what you are to do in connection with the levites and their work
 and the lord said to moses in the waste land of sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of egypt
 let the children of israel keep the passover at its regular time
 in the fourteenth day of this month at evening you are to keep it at the regular time and in the way ordered in the law
 and moses gave orders to the children of israel to keep the passover
 so they kept the passover in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the waste land of sinai as the lord gave orders to moses so the children of israel did
 and there were certain men who were unclean because of a dead body so that they were not able to keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day
 and these men said to him we have been made unclean by the dead body of a man why may we not make the offering of the lord at the regular time among the children of israel
 and moses said to them do nothing till the lord gives me directions about you
 and the lord said to moses
 say to the children of israel if any one of you or of your families is unclean because of a dead body or is on a journey far away still he is to keep the passover to the lord
 in the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they are to keep it taking it with unleavened bread and bitter tasting plants
 nothing of it is to be kept till the morning and no bone of it is to be broken they are to keep it by the rules of the passover
 but the man who not being unclean or on a journey does not keep the passover will be cut off from his people because he did not make the offering of the lord at the regular time his sin will be on him
 and if a man from another country is among you and has a desire to keep the passover to the lord let him do as is ordered in the law of the passover there is to be the same rule for the man from another nation and for him who had his birth in the land
 and on the day when the house was put up the cloud came down on it on the tent of witness and in the evening there was a light like fire over the house till the morning
 and so it was at all times it was covered by the cloud and by a light as of fire by night
 and whenever the cloud was taken up from over the house then the children of israel went journeying on and in the place where the cloud came to rest there the children of israel put up their tents
 at the order of the lord the children of israel went forward and at the order of the lord they put up their tents as long as the cloud was resting on the house they did not go away from that place
 when the cloud was resting on the house for a long time the children of israel waiting for the order of the lord did not go on
 sometimes the cloud was resting on the house for two or three days then by the order of the lord they kept their tents in that place and when the lord gave the order they went on
 and sometimes the cloud was there only from evening to morning and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they went on their journey again or if it was resting there by day and by night whenever the cloud was taken up they went forward
 or if the cloud came to rest on the house for two days or a month or a year without moving the children of israel went on waiting there and did not go on but whenever it was taken up they went forward on their journey
 at the word of the lord they put up their tents and at the word of the lord they went forward on their journey they kept the orders of the lord as he gave them by moses
 the vision of obadiah this is what the lord has said about edom we have had word from the lord and a representative has been sent among the nations saying up  and let us make war against her
 see i have made you small among the nations you are much looked down on
 you have been tricked by the pride of your heart o you whose living place is in the cracks of the rock whose house is high up who has said in his heart who will make me come down to earth
 though you go up on high like an eagle though your house is placed among the stars i will make you come down from there says the lord
 if thieves came attacking you by night  how are you cut off   would they not go on taking till they had enough if men came cutting your grapes would they take them all
 how are the things of esau searched out  how are his secret stores looked for 
 all the men who were united with you have been false to you driving you out to the edge of the land the men who were at peace with you have overcome you they have taken their heritage in your place
 will i not in that day says the lord take away the wise men out of edom and wisdom out of the mountain of esau
 and your men of war o teman will be overcome with fear so that every one of them may be cut off from the mountain of esau
 because you were the cause of violent death and because of your cruel behaviour to your brother jacob you will be covered with shame and will be cut off for ever
 because you were there watching when men from other lands took away his goods and strange men came into his doors and put the fate of jerusalem to the decision of chance you were like one of them
 do not see with pleasure your brothers evil day the day of his fate and do not be glad over the children of judah on the day of their destruction or make wide your mouth on the day of trouble
 do not go into the doors of my people on the day of their downfall do not be looking on their trouble with pleasure on the day of their downfall or put your hands on their goods on the day of their downfall
 and do not take your place at the cross roads cutting off those of his people who get away and do not give up to their haters those who are still there in the day of trouble
 for the day of the lord is coming quickly on all nations as you have done it will be done to you the reward of your acts will come on your head
 for as you have been drinking on my holy mountain so will all the nations go on drinking without end they will go on drinking and the wine will go down their throats and they will be as if they had never been
 but in mount zion some will be kept safe and it will be holy and the children of jacob will take their heritage
 and the children of jacob will be a fire and those of joseph a flame and the children of esau dry stems of grass burned up by them till all is gone and there will be no people living in esau for the lord has said it
 and they will take the south and the lowland and the country of ephraim and gilead as their heritage
 and those of the children of israel who were the first to be taken away as prisoners will have their heritage among the canaanites as far as zarephath and those who were taken away from jerusalem who are in sepharad will have the towns of the south
 and those who have been kept safe will come up from mount zion to be judges of the mountain of esau and the kingdom will be the lords
 the wise sayings of solomon the son of david king of israel
 to have knowledge of wise teaching to be clear about the words of reason
 to be trained in the ways of wisdom in righteousness and judging truly and straight behaviour
 to make the simple minded sharp and to give the young man knowledge and serious purpose
  the wise man hearing will get greater learning and the acts of the man of good sense will be wisely guided 
 to get the sense of wise sayings and secrets and of the words of the wise and their dark sayings
 the fear of the lord is the start of knowledge but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching
 my son give ear to the training of your father and do not give up the teaching of your mother
 for they will be a crown of grace for your head and chain ornaments about your neck
 my son if sinners would take you out of the right way do not go with them
 if they say come with us let us make designs against the good waiting secretly for the upright without cause
 let us overcome them living like the underworld and in their strength as those who go down to death
 goods of great price will be ours our houses will be full of wealth
 take your chance with us and we will all have one money bag
 my son do not go with them keep your feet from their ways
 for their feet are running after evil and they are quick to take a mans life
 truly to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird
 and they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves
 such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit it takes away the life of its owners
 wisdom is crying out in the street her voice is loud in the open places
 her words are sounding in the meeting places and in the doorways of the town
 how long you simple ones will foolish things be dear to you and pride a delight to the haters of authority how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge
 be turned again by my sharp words see i will send the flow of my spirit on you and make my words clear to you
 because your ears were shut to my voice no one gave attention to my out stretched hand
 you were not controlled by my guiding and would have nothing to do with my sharp words
 so in the day of your trouble i will be laughing i will make sport of your fear
 when your fear comes on you like a storm and your trouble like a rushing wind when pain and sorrow come on you
 then i will give no answer to their cries searching for me early they will not see me
 for they were haters of knowledge and did not give their hearts to the fear of the lord
 they had no desire for my teaching and my words of protest were as nothing to them
 so the fruit of their way will be their food and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full
 for the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction
 but whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely living in peace without fear of evil
 a wise son makes a glad father but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother
 wealth which comes from sin is of no profit but righteousness gives salvation from death
 the lord will not let the upright be in need of food but he puts far from him the desire of the evil doers
 he who is slow in his work becomes poor but the hand of the ready worker gets in wealth
 he who in summer gets together his store is a son who does wisely but he who takes his rest when the grain is being cut is a son causing shame
 blessings are on the head of the upright but the face of sinners will be covered with sorrow
 the memory of the upright is a blessing but the name of the evil doer will be turned to dust
 the wise hearted man will let himself be ruled but the man whose talk is foolish will have a fall
 he whose ways are upright will go safely but he whose ways are twisted will be made low
 he who makes signs with his eyes is a cause of trouble but he who makes a man see his errors is a cause of peace
 the mouth of the upright man is a fountain of life but the mouth of the evil doer is a bitter cup
 hate is a cause of violent acts but all errors are covered up by love
 in the lips of him who has knowledge wisdom is seen but a rod is ready for the back of him who is without sense
 knowledge is stored up by the wise but the mouth of the foolish man is a destruction which is near
 the property of the man of wealth is his strong town the poor mans need is his destruction
 the work of the upright gives life the increase of the evil doer is a cause of sin
 he who takes note of teaching is a way of life but he who gives up training is a cause of error
 hate is covered up by the lips of the upright man but he who lets out evil about another is foolish
 where there is much talk there will be no end to sin but he who keeps his mouth shut does wisely
 the tongue of the upright man is like tested silver the heart of the evil doer is of little value
 the lips of the upright man give food to men but the foolish come to death for need of sense
 the blessing of the lord gives wealth hard work makes it no greater
 it is sport to the foolish man to do evil but the man of good sense takes delight in wisdom
 the thing feared by the evil doer will come to him but the upright man will get his desire
 when the storm wind is past the sinner is seen no longer but the upright man is safe for ever
 like acid drink to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes so is the hater of work to those who send him
 the fear of the lord gives long life but the years of the evil doer will be cut short
 the hope of the upright man will give joy but the waiting of the evil doer will have its end in sorrow
 the way of the lord is a strong tower for the upright man but destruction to the workers of evil
 the upright man will never be moved but evil doers will not have a safe resting place in the land
 the mouth of the upright man is budding with wisdom but the twisted tongue will be cut off
 the lips of the upright man have knowledge of what is pleasing but twisted are the mouths of evil doers
 scales of deceit are hated by the lord but a true weight is his delight
 when pride comes there comes shame but wisdom is with the quiet in spirit
 the righteousness of the upright will be their guide but the twisted ways of the false will be their destruction
 wealth is of no profit in the day of wrath but righteousness keeps a man safe from death
 the righteousness of the good man will make his way straight but the sin of the evil doer will be the cause of his fall
 the righteousness of the upright will be their salvation but the false will themselves be taken in their evil designs
 at the death of an upright man his hope does not come to an end but the hope of the evil doer comes to destruction
 the upright man is taken out of trouble and in his place comes the sinner
 with his mouth the evil man sends destruction on his neighbour but through knowledge the upright are taken out of trouble
 when things go well for the upright man all the town is glad at the death of sinners there are cries of joy
 by the blessing of the upright man the town is made great but it is overturned by the mouth of the evil doer
 he who has a poor opinion of his neighbour has no sense but a wise man keeps quiet
 he who goes about talking of others makes secrets public but the true hearted man keeps things covered
 when there is no helping suggestion the people will have a fall but with a number of wise guides they will be safe
 he who makes himself responsible for a strange man will undergo much loss but the hater of such undertakings will be safe
 a woman who is full of grace is honoured but a woman hating righteousness is a seat of shame those hating work will undergo loss but the strong keep their wealth
 the man who has mercy will be rewarded but the cruel man is the cause of trouble to himself
 the sinner gets the payment of deceit but his reward is certain who puts in the seed of righteousness
 so righteousness gives life but he who goes after evil gets death for himself
 the uncontrolled are hated by the lord but those whose ways are without error are his delight
 certainly the evil doer will not go free from punishment but the seed of the upright man will be safe
 like a ring of gold in the nose of a pig is a beautiful woman who has no sense
 the desire of the upright man is only for good but wrath is waiting for the evil doer
 a man may give freely and still his wealth will be increased and another may keep back more than is right but only comes to be in need
 he who gives blessing will be made fat but the curser will himself be cursed
 he who keeps back grain will be cursed by the people but a blessing will be on the head of him who lets them have it for a price
 he who with all his heart goes after what is good is searching for grace but he who is looking for trouble will get it
 he who puts his faith in wealth will come to nothing but the upright man will be full of growth like the green leaf
 the troubler of his house will have the wind for his heritage and the foolish will be servant to the wise hearted
 the fruit of righteousness is a tree of life but violent behaviour takes away souls
 if the upright man is rewarded on earth how much more the evil doer and the sinner 
 a lover of training is a lover of knowledge but a hater of teaching is like a beast
 a good man has grace in the eyes of the lord but the man of evil designs gets punishment from him
 no man will make himself safe through evil doing but the root of upright men will never be moved
 a woman of virtue is a crown to her husband but she whose behaviour is a cause of shame is like a wasting disease in his bones
 the purposes of upright men are right but the designs of evil doers are deceit
 the words of sinners are destruction for the upright but the mouth of upright men is their salvation
 evil doers are overturned and never seen again but the house of upright men will keep its place
 a man will be praised in the measure of his wisdom but a wrong minded man will be looked down on
 he who is of low position and has a servant is better than one who has a high opinion of himself and is in need of bread
 an upright man has thought for the life of his beast but the hearts of evil doers are cruel
 he who does work on his land will not be short of bread but he who goes after foolish men is without sense
 the resting place of the sinner will come to destruction but the root of upright men is for ever
 in the sin of the lips is a net which takes the sinner but the upright man will come out of trouble
 from the fruit of his mouth will a man have good food in full measure and the work of a mans hands will be rewarded
 the way of the foolish man seems right to him but the wise man gives ear to suggestions
 a foolish man lets his trouble be openly seen but a sharp man keeps shame secret
 the breathing out of true words gives knowledge of righteousness but a false witness gives out deceit
 there are some whose uncontrolled talk is like the wounds of a sword but the tongue of the wise makes one well again
 true lips are certain for ever but a false tongue is only for a minute
 deceit is in the heart of those whose designs are evil but for those purposing peace there is joy
 no trouble will come to upright men but sinners will be full of evil
 false lips are hated by the lord but those whose acts are true are his delight
 a sharp man keeps back his knowledge but the heart of foolish men makes clear their foolish thoughts
 the hand of the ready worker will have authority but he who is slow in his work will be put to forced work
 care in the heart of a man makes it weighted down but a good word makes it glad
 the upright man is a guide to his neighbour but the way of evil doers is a cause of error to them
 he who is slow in his work does not go in search of food but the ready worker gets much wealth
 in the road of righteousness is life but the way of the evil doer goes to death
 a wise son is a lover of teaching but the ears of the haters of authority are shut to sharp words
 a man will get good from the fruit of his lips but the desire of the false is for violent acts
 he who keeps a watch on his mouth keeps his life but he whose lips are open wide will have destruction
 the hater of work does not get his desires but the soul of the hard workers will be made fat
 the upright man is a hater of false words the evil doer gets a bad name and is put to shame
 righteousness keeps safe him whose way is without error but evil doers are overturned by sin
 a man may be acting as if he had wealth but have nothing another may seem poor but have great wealth
 a man will give his wealth in exchange for his life but the poor will not give ear to sharp words
 there is a glad dawn for the upright man but the light of the sinner will be put out
 the only effect of pride is fighting but wisdom is with the quiet in spirit
 wealth quickly got will become less but he who gets a store by the work of his hands will have it increased
 hope put off is a weariness to the heart but when what is desired comes it is a tree of life

 childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of children is their fathers
 fair words are not to be looked for from a foolish man much less are false lips in a ruler
 an offering of money is like a stone of great price in the eyes of him who has it wherever he goes he does well
 he who keeps a sin covered is looking for love but he who keeps on talking of a thing makes division between friends
 a word of protest goes deeper into one who has sense than a hundred blows into a foolish man
 an uncontrolled man is only looking for trouble so a cruel servant will be sent against him
 it is better to come face to face with a bear whose young ones have been taken away than with a foolish man acting foolishly
 if anyone gives back evil for good evil will never go away from his house
 the start of fighting is like the letting out of water so give up before it comes to blows
 he who gives a decision for the evil doer and he who gives a decision against the upright are equally disgusting to the lord
 how will money in the hand of the foolish get him wisdom seeing that he has no sense

 nothing good comes to him whose heart is fixed on evil purposes and he who has an evil tongue will come to trouble
 he who has an unwise son gets sorrow for himself and the father of a foolish son has no joy
 a glad heart makes a healthy body but a crushed spirit makes the bones dry
 a sinner takes an offering out of his robe to get a decision for himself in a cause
 wisdom is before the face of him who has sense but the eyes of the foolish are on the ends of the earth
 a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitter pain to her who gave him birth
 to give punishment to the upright is not good or to give blows to the noble for their righteousness
 he who has knowledge says little and he who has a calm spirit is a man of good sense
 even the foolish man when he keeps quiet is taken to be wise when his lips are shut he is credited with good sense
 he who keeps himself separate for his private purpose goes against all good sense
 a foolish man has no pleasure in good sense but only to let what is in his heart come to light
 when the evil doer comes a low opinion comes with him and with the loss of honour comes shame
 the words of a mans mouth are like deep waters the fountain of wisdom is like a flowing stream
 to have respect for the person of the evil doer is not good or to give a wrong decision against the upright
 a foolish mans lips are a cause of fighting and his mouth makes him open to blows
 the mouth of a foolish man is his destruction and his lips are a net for his soul
 the words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food and go down into the inner parts of the stomach
 he who does not give his mind to his work is brother to him who makes destruction
 the name of the lord is a strong tower the upright man running into it is safe
 the property of a man of wealth is his strong town and it is as a high wall in the thoughts of his heart
 before destruction the heart of man is full of pride and before honour goes a gentle spirit
 to give an answer before hearing is a foolish thing and a cause of shame
 the spirit of a man will be his support when he is ill but how may a broken spirit be lifted up
 the heart of the man of good sense gets knowledge the ear of the wise is searching for knowledge
 a mans offering makes room for him letting him come before great men
 the man who first puts his cause before the judge seems to be in the right but then his neighbour comes and puts his cause in its true light
 the decision of chance puts an end to argument parting the strong
 a brother wounded is like a strong town and violent acts are like a locked tower
 with the fruit of a mans mouth his stomach will be full the produce of his lips will be his in full measure
 death and life are in the power of the tongue and those to whom it is dear will have its fruit for their food
 whoever gets a wife gets a good thing and has the approval of the lord
 the poor man makes requests for grace but the man of wealth gives a rough answer
 there are friends who may be a mans destruction but there is a lover who keeps nearer than a brother
 better is the poor man whose ways are upright than the man of wealth whose ways are twisted
 further without knowledge desire is not good and he who is over quick in acting goes out of the right way
 by his foolish behaviour a mans ways are turned upside down and his heart is bitter against the lord
 wealth makes a great number of friends but the poor man is parted from his friend
 a false witness will not go without punishment and the breather out of deceit will not go free
 great numbers will make attempts to get the approval of a ruler and every man is the special friend of him who has something to give
 all the brothers of the poor man are against him how much more do his friends go far from him  
 he who gets wisdom has love for his soul he who keeps good sense will get what is truly good
 a false witness will not go without punishment and the breather out of deceit will be cut off
 material comfort is not good for the foolish much less for a servant to be put over rulers
 a mans good sense makes him slow to wrath and the overlooking of wrongdoing is his glory
 the kings wrath is like the loud cry of a lion but his approval is like dew on the grass
 a foolish son is the destruction of his father and the bitter arguments of a wife are like drops of rain falling without end
 house and wealth are a heritage from fathers but a wife with good sense is from the lord
 hate of work sends deep sleep on a man and he who has no industry will go without food
 he who keeps the law keeps his soul but death will be the fate of him who takes no note of the word
 he who has pity on the poor gives to the lord and the lord will give him his reward
 give your son training while there is hope let not your heart be purposing his death
 a man of great wrath will have to take his punishment for if you get him out of trouble you will have to do it again
 let your ear be open to suggestion and take teaching so that at the end you may be wise
 a mans heart may be full of designs but the purpose of the lord is unchanging
 the ornament of a man is his mercy and a poor man is better than one who is false
 the fear of the lord gives life and he who has it will have need of nothing no evil will come his way
 the hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin and will not even take it to his mouth again
 when blows overtake the man of pride the simple will get sense say sharp words to the wise and knowledge will be made clear to him
 he who is violent to his father driving away his mother is a son causing shame and a bad name
 a son who no longer gives attention to teaching is turned away from the words of knowledge
 a good for nothing witness makes sport of the judges decision and the mouth of evil doers sends out evil like a stream
 rods are being made ready for the man of pride and blows for the back of the foolish
 my son if you will take my words to your heart storing up my laws in your mind
 so that your ear gives attention to wisdom and your heart is turned to knowledge
 truly if you are crying out for good sense and your request is for knowledge
 if you are looking for her as for silver and searching for her as for stored up wealth
 then the fear of the lord will be clear to you and knowledge of god will be yours
 for the lord gives wisdom out of his mouth come knowledge and reason
 he has salvation stored up for the upright he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil
 he keeps watch on the ways which are right and takes care of those who have the fear of him
 then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting and upright behaviour even of every good way
 for wisdom will come into your heart and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul
 wise purposes will be watching over you and knowledge will keep you
 giving you salvation from the evil man from those whose words are false
 who give up the way of righteousness to go by dark roads
 who take pleasure in wrongdoing and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner
 whose ways are not straight and whose footsteps are turned to evil
 to take you out of the power of the strange woman who says smooth words with her tongue
 who is false to the husband of her early years and does not keep the agreement of her god in mind
 for her house is on the way down to death her footsteps go down to the shades
 those who go to her do not come back again their feet do not keep in the ways of life
 so that you may go in the way of good men and keep in the footsteps of the upright
 for the upright will be living in the land and the good will have it for their heritage
 but sinners will be cut off from the land and those whose acts are false will be uprooted
 wine makes men foolish and strong drink makes men come to blows and whoever comes into error through these is not wise
 the wrath of a king is like the loud cry of a lion he who makes him angry does wrong against himself
 it is an honour for a man to keep from fighting but the foolish are ever at war
 the hater of work will not do his ploughing because of the winter so at the time of grain cutting he will be requesting food and will get nothing
 the purpose in the heart of a man is like deep water but a man of good sense will get it out
 most men make no secret of their kind acts but where is a man of good faith to be seen
 an upright man goes on in his righteousness happy are his children after him 
 a king on the seat of judging puts to flight all evil with his eyes
 who is able to say i have made my heart clean i am free from my sin
 unequal weights and unequal measures they are all disgusting to the lord
 even a child may be judged by his doings if his work is free from sin and if it is right
 the hearing ear and the seeing eye are equally the lords work
 do not be a lover of sleep or you will become poor keep your eyes open and you will have bread enough
 a poor thing a poor thing says he who is giving money for goods but when he has gone on his way then he makes clear his pride in what he has got
 there is gold and a store of corals but the lips of knowledge are a jewel of great price
 take a mans clothing if he makes himself responsible for a strange man and get an undertaking from him who gives his word for strange men
 bread of deceit is sweet to a man but after his mouth will be full of sand
 every purpose is put into effect by wise help and by wise guiding make war
 he who goes about talking of the business of others gives away secrets so have nothing to do with him whose lips are open wide
 if anyone puts a curse on his father or his mother his light will be put out in the blackest night
 a heritage may be got quickly at first but the end of it will not be a blessing
 do not say i will give punishment for evil go on waiting for the lord and he will be your saviour
 unequal weights are disgusting to the lord and false scales are not good
 a mans steps are of the lord how then may a man have knowledge of his way
 it is a danger to a man to say without thought it is holy and after taking his oaths to be questioning if it is necessary to keep them
 a wise king puts evil doers to flight and makes their evil doing come back on them
 the lord keeps watch over the spirit of man searching all the deepest parts of the body
 mercy and good faith keep the king safe and the seat of his power is based on upright acts
 the glory of young men is their strength and the honour of old men is their grey hairs
 by the wounds of the rod evil is taken away and blows make clean the deepest parts of the body
 the kings heart in the hands of the lord is like the water streams and by him it is turned in any direction at his pleasure
 every way of a man seems right to himself but the lord is the tester of hearts
 to do what is right and true is more pleasing to the lord than an offering
 a high look and a heart of pride *** of the evil doer is sin
 the purposes of the man of industry have their outcome only in wealth but one who is over quick in acting will only come to be in need
 he who gets stores of wealth by a false tongue is going after what is only breath and searching for death
 by their violent acts the evil doers will be pulled away because they have no desire to do what is right
 twisted is the way of him who is full of crime but as for him whose heart is clean his work is upright
 it is better to be living in an angle of the house top than with a bitter tongued woman in a wide house
 the desire of the evil doer is fixed on evil he has no kind feeling for his neighbour
 when the man of pride undergoes punishment the simple man gets wisdom and by watching the wise he gets knowledge
 the upright one looking on the house of the evil doer lets sinners be overturned to their destruction
 he whose ears are stopped at the cry of the poor will himself get no answer to his cry for help
 by a secret offering wrath is turned away and the heat of angry feelings by money in the folds of the robe
 it is a joy to the good man to do right but it is destruction to the workers of evil
 the wanderer from the way of knowledge will have his resting place among the shades
 the lover of pleasure will be a poor man the lover of wine and oil will not get wealth
 the evil doer will be given as a price for the life of the good man and the worker of deceit in the place of the upright
 it is better to be living in a waste land than with a bitter tongued and angry woman
 there is a store of great value in the house of the wise but it is wasted by the foolish man
 he who goes after righteousness and mercy will get life righteousness and honour
 a wise man goes up into the town of the strong ones and overcomes its strength in which they put their faith
 he who keeps watch over his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles
 the man of pride lifted up in soul is named high hearted he is acting in an outburst of pride
 the desire of the hater of work is death to him for his hands will do no work
 all the day the sinner goes after his desire but the upright man gives freely keeping nothing back
 the offering of evil doers is disgusting how much more when they give it with an evil purpose 
 a false witness will be cut off 
 the evil doer makes his face hard but as for the upright he gives thought to his way
 wisdom and knowledge and wise suggestions are of no use against the lord
 the horse is made ready for the day of war but power to overcome is from the lord
 a good name is more to be desired than great wealth and to be respected is better than silver and gold
 the man of wealth and the poor man come face to face the lord is the maker of them all
 the sharp man sees the evil and takes cover the simple go straight on and get into trouble
 the reward of a gentle spirit and the fear of the lord is wealth and honour and life
 thorns and nets are in the way of the twisted he who keeps watch over his soul will be far from them
 if a child is trained up in the right way even when he is old he will not be turned away from it
 the man of wealth has rule over the poor and he who gets into debt is a servant to his creditor
 by planting the seed of evil a man will get in the grain of sorrow and the rod of his wrath will be broken
 he who is kind will have a blessing for he gives of his bread to the poor
 send away the man of pride and argument will go out truly fighting and shame will come to an end
 he whose heart is clean is dear to the lord for the grace of his lips the king will be his friend
 the eyes of the lord keep knowledge but by him the acts of the false man will be overturned
 the hater of work says there is a lion outside i will be put to death in the streets
 the mouth of strange women is a deep hole he with whom the lord is angry will go down into it
 foolish ways are deep seated in the heart of a child but the rod of punishment will send them far from him
 he who is cruel to the poor for the purpose of increasing his profit and he who gives to the man of wealth will only come to be in need
 let your ear be bent down for hearing my words and let your heart give thought to knowledge
 for it is a delight to keep them in your heart to have them ready on your lips
 so that your faith may be in the lord i have made them clear to you this day even to you
 have i not put in writing for you thirty sayings with wise suggestions and knowledge
 to make you see how certain are true words so that you may give a true answer to those who put questions to you
 do not take away the property of the poor man because he is poor or be cruel to the crushed ones when they come before the judge
 for the lord will give support to their cause and take the life of those who take their goods
 do not be friends with a man who is given to wrath do not go in the company of an angry man
 for fear of learning his ways and making a net ready for your soul
 be not one of those who give their hands in an agreement or of those who make themselves responsible for debts
 if you have nothing with which to make payment he will take away your bed from under you
 let not the old landmark be moved which your fathers have put in place
 have you seen a man who is expert in his business he will take his place before kings his place will not be among low persons
 when you take your seat at the feast with a ruler give thought with care to what is before you
 and put a knife to your throat if you have a strong desire for food
 have no desire for his delicate food for it is the bread of deceit
 take no care to get wealth let there be an end to your desire for money
 are your eyes lifted up to it it is gone for wealth takes to itself wings like an eagle in flight up to heaven
 do not take the food of him who has an evil eye or have any desire for his delicate meat
 for as the thoughts of his heart are so is he take food and drink he says to you but his heart is not with you
 the food which you have taken will come up again and your pleasing words will be wasted
 say nothing in the hearing of a foolish man for he will put no value on the wisdom of your words
 do not let the landmark of the widow be moved and do not go into the fields of those who have no father
 for their saviour is strong and he will take up their cause against you
 give your heart to teaching and your ears to the words of knowledge
 do not keep back training from the child for even if you give him blows with the rod it will not be death to him
 give him blows with the rod and keep his soul safe from the underworld
 my son if your heart becomes wise i even i will be glad in heart
 and my thoughts in me will be full of joy when your lips say right things
 have no envy of sinners in your heart but keep in the fear of the lord all through the day
 for without doubt there is a future and your hope will not be cut off
 give ear my son and be wise guiding your heart in the right way
 do not be among those who give themselves to wine drinking or among those who make themselves full with meat
 for those who take delight in drink and feasting will come to be in need and through love of sleep a man will be poorly clothed
 give ear to your father whose child you are and do not keep honour from your mother when she is old
 get for yourself that which is true and do not let it go for money get wisdom and teaching and good sense
 the father of the upright man will be glad and he who has a wise child will have joy because of him
 let your father and your mother be glad let her who gave you birth have joy
 my son give me your heart and let your eyes take delight in my ways
 for a loose woman is a deep hollow and a strange woman is a narrow water hole
 yes she is waiting secretly like a beast for its food and deceit by her is increased among men
 who says oh  who says ah  who has violent arguments who has grief who has wounds without cause whose eyes are dark
 those who are seated late over the wine those who go looking for mixed wine
 keep your eyes from looking on the wine when it is red when its colour is bright in the cup when it goes smoothly down
 in the end its bite is like that of a snake its wound like the wound of a poison snake
 your eyes will see strange things and you will say twisted things
 yes you will be like him who takes his rest on the sea or on the top of a sail support
 they have overcome me you will say and i have no pain they gave me blows without my feeling them when will i be awake from my wine i will go after it again
 have no envy for evil men or any desire to be with them
 for the purposes of their hearts are destruction and their lips are talking of trouble
 the building of a house is by wisdom and by reason it is made strong
 and by knowledge its rooms are full of all dear and pleasing things
 a wise man is strong and a man of knowledge makes strength greater
 for by wise guiding you will overcome in war and in a number of wise guides there is salvation
 wisdom is outside the power of the foolish he keeps his mouth shut in the public place
 he whose purposes are bad will be named a man of evil designs
 the purpose of the foolish is sin and the hater of authority is disgusting to others
 if you give way in the day of trouble your strength is small
 be the saviour of those who are given up to death and do not keep back help from those who are slipping to destruction
 if you say see we had no knowledge of this does not the tester of hearts give thought to it and he who keeps your soul has he no knowledge of it and will he not give to every man the reward of his work
 my son take honey for it is good and the flowing honey which is sweet to your taste
 so let your desire be for wisdom if you have it there will be a future and your hope will not be cut off
 do not keep a secret watch o evil doer against the fields of the upright man or send destruction on his resting place
 for an upright man after falling seven times will get up again but trouble is the downfall of the evil
 do not be glad at the fall of your hater and let not your heart have joy at his downfall
 for fear that the lord may see it and it may be evil in his eyes and his wrath may be turned away from him
 do not be troubled because of evil doers or have envy of sinners
 for there will be no future for the evil man the light of sinners will be put out
 my son go in fear of the lord and the king have nothing to do with those who are in high positions
 for their downfall will come suddenly and who has knowledge of the destruction of those in high positions

 the curse of the lord is on the house of the evil doer but his blessing is on the tent of the upright
 he makes sport of the men of pride but he gives grace to the gentle hearted
 the wise will have glory for their heritage but shame will be the reward of the foolish
 the words of agur the son of jakeh from massa the man says i am full of weariness o god i am full of weariness o god i have come to an end
 for i am more like a beast than any man i have no power of reasoning like a man
 i have not got wisdom by teaching so that i might have the knowledge of the holy one
 who has gone up to heaven and come down who has taken the winds in his hands prisoning the waters in his robe by whom have all the ends of the earth been fixed what is his name and what is his sons name if you are able to say
 every word of god is tested he is a breastplate to those who put their faith in him
 make no addition to his words or he will make clear your error and you will be seen to be false
 i have made request to you for two things do not keep them from me before my death

 do not say evil of a servant to his master or he will put a curse on you and you will get into trouble
 there is a generation who put a curse on their father and do not give a blessing to their mother
 there is a generation who seem to themselves to be free from sin but are not washed from their unclean ways
 there is a generation o how full of pride are their eyes  o how their brows are lifted up 
 there is a generation whose teeth are like swords their strong teeth like knives for the destruction of the poor from the earth and of those who are in need from among men
 the night spirit has two daughters give give there are three things which are never full even four which never say enough
 the underworld and the woman without a child the earth which never has enough water and the fire which never says enough
 the eye which makes sport of a father and sees no value in a mother when she is old will be rooted out by the ravens of the valley and be food for the young eagles
 there are three things the wonder of which overcomes me even four things outside my knowledge
 the way of an eagle in the air the way of a snake on a rock the way of a ship in the heart of the sea and the way of a man with a girl
 this is the way of a false wife she takes food and cleaning her mouth says i have done no wrong
 for three things the earth is moved and there are four which it will not put up with
 a servant when he becomes a king a man without sense when his wealth is increased
 a hated woman when she is married and a servant girl who takes the place of her masters wife
 there are four things which are little on the earth but they are very wise
 the ants are a people not strong but they put by a store of food in the summer
 the conies are only a feeble people but they make their houses in the rocks

 the words of lemuel king of massa the teaching which he had from his mother
 what am i to say to you o lemuel my oldest son and what o son of my body and what o son of my oaths
 do not give your strength to women or your ways to that which is the destruction of kings
 it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to take wine or for rulers to say where is strong drink
 for fear that through drinking they may come to have no respect for the law wrongly judging the cause of those who are in trouble
 give strong drink to him who is near to destruction and wine to him whose soul is bitter
 let him have drink and his need will go from his mind and the memory of his trouble will be gone
 let your mouth be open for those who have no voice in the cause of those who are ready for death
 let your mouth be open judging rightly and give right decisions in the cause of the poor and those in need
 who may make discovery of a woman of virtue for her price is much higher than jewels
 the heart of her husband has faith in her and he will have profit in full measure
 she does him good and not evil all the days of her life
 she gets wool and linen working at the business of her hands
 she is like the trading ships getting food from far away
 she gets up while it is still night and gives meat to her family and their food to her servant girls
 after looking at a field with care she gets it for a price planting a vine garden with the profit of her work
 she puts a band of strength round her and makes her arms strong
 she sees that her marketing is of profit to her her light does not go out by night
 she puts her hands to the cloth working rod and her fingers take the wheel
 her hands are stretched out to the poor yes she is open handed to those who are in need
 she has no fear of the snow for her family for all those in her house are clothed in red
 she makes for herself cushions of needlework her clothing is fair linen and purple
 her husband is a man of note in the public place when he takes his seat among the responsible men of the land
 she makes linen robes and gets a price for them and traders take her cloth bands for a price
 strength and self respect are her clothing she is facing the future with a smile
 her mouth is open to give out wisdom and the law of mercy is on her tongue
 she gives attention to the ways of her family she does not take her food without working for it
 her children get up and give her honour and her husband gives her praise saying
 unnumbered women have done well but you are better than all of them
 fair looks are a deceit and a beautiful form is of no value but a woman who has the fear of the lord is to be praised
 give her credit for what her hands have made let her be praised by her works in the public place
 give ear my sons to the teaching of a father give attention so that you may have knowledge
 for i give you good teaching do not give up the knowledge you are getting from me
 for i was a son to my father a gentle and an only one to my mother
 and he gave me teaching saying to me keep my words in your heart keep my rules so that you may have life
 get wisdom get true knowledge keep it in memory do not be turned away from the words of my mouth
 do not give her up and she will keep you give her your love and she will make you safe
 the first sign of wisdom is to get wisdom go give all you have to get true knowledge
 put her in a high place and you will be lifted up by her she will give you honour when you give her your love
 she will put a crown of grace on your head giving you a head dress of glory
 give ear o my son and let your heart be open to my sayings and long life will be yours
 i have given you teaching in the way of wisdom guiding your steps in the straight way
 when you go your way will not be narrow and in running you will not have a fall
 take learning in your hands do not let her go keep her for she is your life
 do not go in the road of sinners or be walking in the way of evil men
 keep far from it do not go near be turned from it and go on your way
 for they take no rest till they have done evil their sleep is taken away if they have not been the cause of someones fall
 the bread of evil doing is their food the wine of violent acts their drink
 but the way of the upright is like the light of early morning getting brighter and brighter till the full day
 the way of sinners is dark they see not the cause of their fall
 my son give attention to my words let your ear be turned to my sayings
 let them not go from your eyes keep them deep in your heart
 for they are life to him who gets them and strength to all his flesh
 and keep watch over your heart with all care so you will have life
 put away from you an evil tongue and let false lips be far from you
 keep your eyes on what is in front of you looking straight before you
 keep a watch on your behaviour let all your ways be rightly ordered
 let there be no turning to the right or to the left keep your feet from evil
 my son give attention to my wisdom let your ear be turned to my teaching
 so that you may be ruled by a wise purpose and your lips may keep knowledge
 for honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman and her mouth is smoother than oil
 but her end is bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two edged sword
 her feet go down to death and her steps to the underworld
 she never keeps her mind on the road of life her ways are uncertain she has no knowledge
 give ear to me then my sons and do not put away my words from you
 go far away from her do not come near the door of her house
 for fear that you may give your honour to others and your wealth to strange men
 and strange men may be full of your wealth and the fruit of your work go to the house of others
 and you will be full of grief at the end of your life when your flesh and your body are wasted
 and you will say how was teaching hated by me and my heart put no value on training
 i did not give attention to the voice of my teachers my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me 
 i was in almost all evil in the company of the people
 let water from your store and not that of others be your drink and running water from your fountain
 let not your springs be flowing in the streets or your streams of water in the open places
 let them be for yourself only not for other men with you
 let blessing be on your fountain have joy in the wife of your early years
 as a loving hind and a gentle doe let her breasts ever give you rapture let your passion at all times be moved by her love
 why let yourself my son go out of the way with a strange woman and take another woman in your arms
 for a mans ways are before the eyes of the lord and he puts all his goings in the scales
 the evil doer will be taken in the net of his crimes and prisoned in the cords of his sin
 he will come to his end for need of teaching he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way
 my son if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour or given your word for another
 you are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth the sayings of your lips have overcome you
 do this my son and make yourself free because you have come into the power of your neighbour go without waiting and make a strong request to your neighbour
 give no sleep to your eyes or rest to them
 make yourself free like the roe from the hand of the archer and the bird from him who puts a net for her
 go to the ant you hater of work give thought to her ways and be wise
 having no chief overseer or ruler
 she gets her meat in the summer storing up food at the time of the grain cutting
 how long will you be sleeping o hater of work when will you get up from your sleep
 a little sleep a little rest a little folding of the hands in sleep
 then loss will come on you like an outlaw and your need like an armed man
 a good for nothing man is an evil doer he goes on his way causing trouble with false words
 making signs with his eyes rubbing with his feet and giving news with his fingers
 his mind is ever designing evil he lets loose violent acts
 for this cause his downfall will be sudden quickly he will be broken and there will be no help for him
 six things are hated by the lord seven things are disgusting to him
 eyes of pride a false tongue hands which take life without cause
 a heart full of evil designs feet which are quick in running after sin
 a false witness breathing out untrue words and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers
 my son keep the rule of your father and have in memory the teaching of your mother
 keep them ever folded in your heart and have them hanging round your neck
 in your walking it will be your guide when you are sleeping it will keep watch over you when you are awake it will have talk with you
 for the rule is a light and the teaching a shining light and the guiding words of training are the way of life
 they will keep you from the evil woman from the smooth tongue of the strange woman
 let not your hearts desire go after her fair body let not her eyes take you prisoner
 for a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread but another mans wife goes after ones very life
 may a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing
 or may one go on lighted coals and his feet not be burned
 so it is with him who goes in to his neighbours wife he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment
 men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it
 but if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much giving up all his property which is in his house
 he who takes another mans wife is without all sense he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul
 wounds will be his and loss of honour and his shame may not be washed away
 for bitter is the wrath of an angry husband in the day of punishment he will have no mercy
 he will not take any payment and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased
 my son keep my sayings and let my rules be stored up with you
 keep my rules and you will have life let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes
 let them be fixed to your fingers and recorded in your heart
 say to wisdom you are my sister let knowledge be named your special friend
 so that they may keep you from the strange woman even from her whose words are smooth
 looking out from my house and watching through the window
 i saw among the young men one without sense
 walking in the street near the turn of her road going on the way to her house
 at nightfall in the evening of the day in the black dark of the night
 and the woman came out to him in the dress of a loose woman with a designing heart
 she is full of noise and uncontrolled her feet keep not in her house
 now she is in the street now in the open spaces waiting at every turning of the road
 so she took him by his hand kissing him and without a sign of shame she said to him
 i have a feast of peace offerings for today my oaths have been effected
 so i came out in the hope of meeting you looking for you with care and now i have you
 my bed is covered with cushions of needlework with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of egypt
 i have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices
 come let us take our pleasure in love till the morning having joy in loves delights
 for the master of the house is away on a long journey
 he has taken a bag of money with him he is coming back at the full moon
 with her fair words she overcame him forcing him with her smooth lips
 the simple man goes after her like an ox going to its death like a roe pulled by a cord
 like a bird falling into a net with no thought that his life is in danger till an arrow goes into his side
 so now my sons give ear to me give attention to the sayings of my mouth
 let not your heart be turned to her ways do not go wandering in her footsteps
 for those wounded and made low by her are great in number and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army
 her house is the way to the underworld going down to the rooms of death
 is not wisdom crying out and the voice of knowledge sounding
 at the top of the highways at the meeting of the roads she takes her place
 where the roads go into the town her cry goes out at the doorways her voice is loud
 i am crying out to you o men my voice comes to the sons of men
 become expert in reason o you simple ones you foolish ones take training to heart
 give ear for my words are true and my lips are open to give out what is upright
 for good faith goes out of my mouth and false lips are disgusting to me
 all the words of my mouth are righteousness there is nothing false or twisted in them
 they are all true to him whose mind is awake and straightforward to those who get knowledge
 take my teaching and not silver get knowledge in place of the best gold
 for wisdom is better than jewels and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her
 i wisdom have made wise behaviour my near relation i am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes
 the fear of the lord is seen in hating evil pride a high opinion of oneself the evil way and the false tongue are unpleasing to me
 wise design and good sense are mine reason and strength are mine
 through me kings have their power and rulers give right decisions
 through me chiefs have authority and the noble ones are judging in righteousness
 those who have given me their love are loved by me and those who make search for me with care will get me
 wealth and honour are in my hands even wealth without equal and righteousness
 my fruit is better than gold even than the best gold and my increase is more to be desired than silver
 i go in the road of righteousness in the way of right judging
 so that i may give my lovers wealth for their heritage making their store houses full
 the lord made me as the start of his way the first of his works in the past
 from eternal days i was given my place from the birth of time before the earth was
 when there was no deep i was given birth when there were no fountains flowing with water
 before the mountains were put in their places before the hills was my birth
 when he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world
 when he made ready the heavens i was there when he put an arch over the face of the deep
 when he made strong the skies overhead when the fountains of the deep were fixed
 when he put a limit to the sea so that the waters might not go against his word when he put in position the bases of the earth
 then i was by his side as a master workman and i was his delight from day to day playing before him at all times
 playing in his earth and my delight was with the sons of men
 give ear to me then my sons for happy are those who keep my ways
 take my teaching and be wise do not let it go
 happy is the man who gives ear to me watching at my doors day by day keeping his place by the pillars of my house
 for whoever gets me gets life and grace from the lord will come to him
 but he who does evil to me does wrong to his soul all my haters are in love with death
 wisdom has made her house putting up her seven pillars
 she has put her fat beasts to death her wine is mixed her table is ready
 she has sent out her women servants her voice goes out to the highest places of the town saying
 whoever is simple let him come in here and to him who has no sense she says
 come take of my bread and of my wine which is mixed
 give up the simple ones and have life and go in the way of knowledge
 he who gives teaching to a man of pride gets shame for himself he who says sharp words to a sinner gets a bad name
 do not say sharp words to a man of pride or he will have hate for you make them clear to a wise man and you will be dear to him
 give teaching to a wise man and he will become wiser give training to an upright man and his learning will be increased
 the fear of the lord is the start of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy one gives a wise mind
 for by me your days will be increased and the years of your life will be long
 if you are wise you are wise for yourself if your heart is full of pride you only will have the pain of it
 the foolish woman is full of noise she has no sense at all
 seated at the door of her house in the high places of the town
 crying out to those who go by going straight on their way she says
 whoever is simple let him come in here and to him who is without sense she says
 drink taken without right is sweet and food in secret is pleasing
 but he does not see that the dead are there that her guests are in the deep places of the underworld
 happy is the man who does not go in the company of sinners or take his place in the way of evil doers or in the seat of those who do not give honour to the lord
 but whose delight is in the law of the lord and whose mind is on his law day and night
 he will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water which gives its fruit at the right time whose leaves will ever be green and he will do well in all his undertakings
 the evil doers are not so but are like the dust from the grain which the wind takes away
 for this cause there will be no mercy for sinners when they are judged and the evil doers will have no place among the upright
 because the lord sees the way of the upright but the end of the sinner is destruction
 why do you keep far away o lord why are you not to be seen in times of trouble
 the evil doer in his pride is cruel to the poor let him be taken by the tricks of his invention
 for the evil doer is lifted up because of the purpose of his heart and he whose mind is fixed on wealth is turned away from the lord saying evil against him
 the evil doer in his pride says god will not make a search all his thoughts are there is no god
 his ways are ever fixed your decisions are higher than he may see as for his haters they are as nothing to him
 he has said in his heart i will not be moved through all generations i will never be in trouble
 his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and false words under his tongue are evil purposes and dark thoughts
 he is waiting in the dark places of the towns in the secret places he puts to death those who have done no wrong his eyes are secretly turned against the poor
 he keeps himself in a secret place like a lion in his hole waiting to put his hands on the poor man and pulling him into his net
 the upright are crushed and made low and the feeble are overcome by his strong ones
 he says in his heart god has no memory of me his face is turned away he will never see it
 up  o lord let your hand be lifted give thought to the poor
 why has the evil doer a low opinion of god saying in his heart you will not make search for it
 you have seen it for your eyes are on sorrow and grief to take it into your hand the poor man puts his faith in you you have been the helper of the child who has no father
 let the arm of the sinner and the evil doer be broken go on searching for his sin till there is no more
 the lord is king for ever and ever the nations are gone from his land
 lord you have given ear to the prayer of the poor you will make strong their hearts you will give them a hearing
 to give decision for the child without a father and for the broken hearted so that the man of the earth may no longer be feared
 &lta psalm of praise&gt make a glad sound to the lord all the earth
 give worship to the lord with joy come before him with a song
 be certain that the lord is god it is he who has made us and we are his we are his people and the sheep to whom he gives food
 come into his doors with joy and into his house with praise give him honour blessing his name
 for the lord is good and his mercy is never ending his faith is unchanging through all generations
 &lta psalm of david&gt i will make a song of mercy and righteousness to you o lord will i make melody
 i will do wisely in the way of righteousness o when will you come to me i will be walking in my house with a true heart
 i will not put any evil thing before my eyes i am against all turning to one side i will not have it near me
 the false heart i will send away from me i will not have an evil doer for a friend
 i will put to death anyone who says evil of his neighbour secretly the man with a high look and a heart of pride is disgusting to me
 my eyes will be on those of good faith in the land so that they may be living in my house he who is walking in the right way will be my servant
 the worker of deceit will not come into my house the false man will have no place before my eyes
 morning by morning will i put to death all the sinners in the land so that all evil doers may be cut off from jerusalem
 &lta prayer of the man who is in trouble when he is overcome and puts his grief before the lord&gt give ear to my prayer o lord and let my cry come to you
 let not your face be veiled from me in the day of my trouble give ear to me and let my cry be answered quickly
 my days are wasted like smoke and my bones are burned up as in a fire
 my heart is broken it has become dry and dead like grass so that i give no thought to food
 because of the voice of my sorrow my flesh is wasted to the bone
 i am like a bird living by itself in the waste places like the night bird in a waste of sand
 i keep watch like a bird by itself on the house top
 my haters say evil of me all day those who are violent against me make use of my name as a curse
 i have had dust for bread and my drink has been mixed with weeping
 because of your passion and your wrath for i have been lifted up and then made low by you
 my days are like a shade which is stretched out i am dry like the grass
 but you o lord are eternal and your name will never come to an end
 you will again get up and have mercy on zion for the time has come for her to be comforted
 for your servants take pleasure in her stones looking with love on her dust
 so the nations will give honour to the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth will be in fear of his glory
 when the lord has put up the walls of zion and has been been in his glory
 when he has given ear to the prayer of the poor and has not put his request on one side
 this will be put in writing for the coming generation and the people of the future will give praise to the lord
 for from his holy place the lord has seen looking down on the earth from heaven
 hearing the cry of the prisoner making free those for whom death is ordered
 so that they may give out the name of the lord in zion and his praise in jerusalem
 when the peoples are come together and the kingdoms to give worship to the lord
 he has taken my strength from me in the way he has made short my days
 i will say o my god take me not away before my time your years go on through all generations
 in the past you put the earth on its base and the heavens are the work of your hands
 they will come to an end but you will still go on they all will become old like a coat and like a robe they will be changed
 but you are the unchanging one and your years will have no end
 the children of your servants will have a safe resting place and their seed will be ever before you
 &ltof david&gt give praise to the lord o my soul let everything in me give praise to his holy name
 give praise to the lord o my soul let not all his blessings go from your memory
 he has forgiveness for all your sins he takes away all your diseases
 he keeps back your life from destruction crowning you with mercy and grace
 he makes your mouth full of good things so that your strength is made new again like the eagles
 the lord gives decisions in righteousness for all who are in trouble
 he gave knowledge of his way to moses and made his acts clear to the children of israel
 the lord is kind and full of pity not quickly made angry but ever ready to have mercy
 his feeling will no longer be bitter he will not keep his wrath for ever
 he has not given us the punishment for our sins or the reward of our wrongdoing
 for as the heaven is high over the earth so great is his mercy to his worshippers
 as far as the east is from the west so far has he put our sins from us
 as a father has pity on his children so the lord has pity on his worshippers
 for he has knowledge of our feeble frame he sees that we are only dust
 as for man his days are as grass his beautiful growth is like the flower of the field
 the wind goes over it and it is gone and its place sees it no longer
 but the mercy of the lord is eternal for his worshippers and their childrens children will see his righteousness
 if they keep his agreement and have his laws in mind to do them
 the lord has made ready his high seat in the heavens his kingdom is ruling over all
 give praise to the lord you his angels who are great in strength doing his orders and waiting for his voice
 give praise to the lord all you his armies and you his servants who do his pleasure
 give praise to the lord all his works in all places under his rule give praise to the lord o my soul
 give praise to the lord o my soul o lord my god you are very great you are robed with honour and power
 you are clothed with light as with a robe stretching out the heavens like a curtain
 the arch of your house is based on the waters you make the clouds your carriage you go on the wings of the wind
 he makes winds his angels and flames of fire his servants
 he has made the earth strong on its bases so that it may not be moved for ever and ever
 covering it with the sea as with a robe the waters were high over the mountains
 at the voice of your word they went in flight at the sound of your thunder they went away in fear
 the mountains came up and the valleys went down into the place which you had made ready for them
 you made a limit over which they might not go so that the earth would never again be covered by them
 you sent the springs into the valleys they are flowing between the hills
 they give drink to every beast of the field the mountain asses come to them for water
 the birds of the air have their resting places by them and make their song among the branches
 he sends down rain from his store houses on the hills the earth is full of the fruit of his works
 he makes the grass come up for the cattle and plants for the use of man so that bread may come out of the earth
 and wine to make glad the heart of man and oil to make his face shining and bread giving strength to his heart
 the trees of the lord are full of growth the cedars of lebanon of his planting
 where the birds have their resting places as for the stork the tall trees are her house
 the high hills are a safe place for the mountain goats and the rocks for the small beasts
 he made the moon for a sign of the divisions of the year teaching the sun the time of its going down
 when you make it dark it is night when all the beasts of the woods come quietly out of their secret places
 the young lions go thundering after their food searching for their meat from god
 the sun comes up and they come together and go back to their secret places to take their rest
 man goes out to his work and to his business till the evening
 o lord how great is the number of your works  in wisdom you have made them all the earth is full of the things you have made
 there is the great wide sea where there are living things great and small more than may be numbered
 there go the ships there is that great beast which you have made as a plaything
 all of them are waiting for you to give them their food in its time
 they take what you give them they are full of the good things which come from your open hand
 if your face is veiled they are troubled when you take away their breath they come to an end and go back to the dust
 if you send out your spirit they are given life you make new the face of the earth
 let the glory of the lord be for ever let the lord have joy in his works
 at whose look the earth is shaking at whose touch the mountains send out smoke
 i will make songs to the lord all my life i will make melody to my god while i have my being
 let my thoughts be sweet to him i will be glad in the lord
 let sinners be cut off from the earth and let all evil doers come to an end give praise to the lord o my soul give praise to the lord
 o give praise to the lord give honour to his name talking of his doings among the peoples
 let your voice be sounding in songs and melody let all your thoughts be of the wonder of his works
 have glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who are searching after the lord be glad
 let your search be for the lord and for his strength let your hearts ever be turned to him
 keep in mind the great works which he has done his wonders and the decisions of his mouth
 o you seed of abraham his servant you children of jacob his loved ones
 he is the lord our god he is judge of all the earth
 he has kept his agreement in mind for ever the word which he gave for a thousand generations
 the agreement which he made with abraham and his oath to isaac
 and he gave it to jacob for a law and to israel for an eternal agreement
 saying to you will i give the land of canaan the measured line of your heritage
 when they were still small in number and strange in the land
 when they went about from one nation to another and from one kingdom to another people
 he would not let anyone do them wrong he even kept back kings because of them
 saying put not your hand on those who have been marked with my holy oil and do my prophets no wrong
 and he took away all food from the land so that the people were without bread
 he sent a man before them even joseph who was given as a servant for a price
 his feet were fixed in chains his neck was put in iron bands
 till the time when his word came true he was tested by the word of the lord
 the king sent men to take off his chains even the ruler of the people who let him go free
 he made him lord of his house and ruler over everything he had
 to give his chiefs teaching at his pleasure and so that his law givers might get wisdom from him
 then israel came into egypt and jacob was living in the land of ham
 and his people were greatly increased and became stronger than those who were against them
 their hearts were turned to hate against his people so that they made secret designs against them
 he sent moses his servant and aaron the man of his selection
 he let his signs be seen among the people and his wonders in the land of ham
 he sent black night and made it dark and they did not go against his word
 at his word their waters were turned to blood and he sent death on all their fish
 their land was full of frogs even in the rooms of the king
 he gave the word and there came the dog fly and insects over all the land
 he gave them ice for rain and flaming fire in their land
 he gave their vines and their fig trees to destruction and the trees of their land were broken down
 at his word the locusts came and young locusts more than might be numbered
 and put an end to all the plants of their land taking all the fruit of the earth for food
 he put to death the first child of every family in the land the first fruits of their strength
 he took his people out with silver and gold there was not one feeble person among them
 egypt was glad when they went for the fear of them had come down on them
 a cloud was stretched over them for a cover and he sent fire to give light in the night
 at the peoples request he sent birds and gave them the bread of heaven for food
 his hand made the rock open and the waters came streaming out they went down through the dry places like a river
 for he kept in mind his holy word and abraham his servant
 and he took his people out with joy the men of his selection with glad cries
 and gave them the lands of the nations and they took the work of the peoples for a heritage
 so that they might keep his orders and be true to his laws give praise to the lord
 let the lord be praised o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 who is able to give an account of the great acts of the lord or to make clear all his praise
 happy are they whose decisions are upright and he who does righteousness at all times
 keep me in mind o lord when you are good to your people o let your salvation come to me
 so that i may see the well being of the people of your selection and have a part in the joy of your nation and take pride in your heritage
 we are sinners like our fathers we have done wrong our acts are evil
 our fathers did not give thought to your wonders in egypt they did not keep in memory the great number of your mercies but gave you cause for wrath at the sea even at the red sea
 but he was their saviour because of his name so that men might see his great power
 by his word the red sea was made dry and he took them through the deep waters as through the waste land
 and he took them safely out of the hands of their haters and kept them from the attacks of those who were against them
 and the waters went over their haters all of them came to an end
 then they had faith in his words they gave him songs of praise
 but their memory of his works was short not waiting to be guided by him
 they gave way to their evil desires in the waste land and put god to the test in the dry places
 and he gave them their request but sent a wasting disease into their souls
 they were full of envy against moses among the tents and against aaron the holy one of the lord
 the earth opening put an end to dathan covering up abiram and his band
 and a fire was lighted among their tents the sinners were burned up by the flames
 they made a young ox in horeb and gave worship to an image of gold
 and their glory was changed into the image of an ox whose food is grass
 they had no memory of god their saviour who had done great things in egypt
 works of wonder in the land of ham and things of fear by the red sea
 and he was purposing to put an end to them if moses his special servant had not gone up before him between him and his people turning back his wrath to keep them from destruction
 they were disgusted with the good land they had no belief in his word
 talking against him secretly in their tents they did not give ear to the voice of the lord
 so he made an oath against them to put an end to them in the waste land
 that their children might be mixed among the nations and sent away into other lands
 and they were joined to baal peor and took part in the offerings to the dead
 so they made him angry by their behaviour and he sent disease on them
 then phinehas got up and made prayer for them and the disease went no farther
 and all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever
 they made god angry again at the waters of meribah so that moses was troubled because of them
 for they made his spirit bitter and he said unwise things
 they did not put an end to the peoples as the lord had said
 but they were joined to the nations learning their works
 and they gave worship to images which were a danger to them
 they even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits
 and gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong offering them to the images of canaan and the land was made unclean with blood
 so they became unclean through their works going after their evil desires
 then the wrath of the lord was burning against his people and he was angry with his heritage
 and he gave them into the hands of the nations and they were ruled by their haters
 by them they were crushed and made low under their hands
 again and again he made them free but their hearts were turned against his purpose and they were overcome by their sins
 but when their cry came to his ears he had pity on their trouble
 and kept in mind his agreement with them and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness
 he put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners
 be our saviour o lord our god and let us come back together from among the nations so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise
 praise be to the lord god of israel for ever and for ever and let all the people say so be it give praise to the lord
 o give praise to the lord for he is good for his mercy is unchanging for ever
 let those whose cause the lord has taken up say so his people whom he has taken out of the hands of their haters
 making them come together out of all the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south
 they were wandering in the waste places they saw no way to a resting place
 their souls became feeble for need of food and drink
 then they sent up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles
 guiding them in the right way so that they might come into the town of their resting place
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 he gives its desire to the unresting soul so that it is full of good things
 those who were in the dark in the black night in chains of sorrow and iron
 because they went against the words of god and gave no thought to the laws of the most high
 so that he made their hearts weighted down with grief they were falling and had no helper
 then they sent up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gave them salvation out of all their troubles
 he took them out of the dark and the black night and all their chains were broken
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 the doors of brass are broken by his arm and the bands of iron are cut in two
 foolish men because of their sins and because of their wrongdoing are troubled
 they are disgusted by all food and they come near to the doors of death
 then they send up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles
 he sent his word and made them well and kept them safe from the underworld
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 let them make offerings of praise giving news of his works with cries of joy
 those who go down to the sea in ships who do business in the great waters
 they see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep
 for at his word comes up the storm wind lifting high the waves
 the sailors go up to heaven and down into the deep their souls are wasted because of their trouble
 they are turned here and there rolling like a man who is full of wine and all their wisdom comes to nothing
 then they send up their cry to the lord in their sorrow and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles
 he makes the storm into a calm so that the waves are at peace
 then they are glad because the sea is quiet and he takes them to the harbour of their desire
 let men give praise to the lord for his mercy and for the wonders which he does for the children of men 
 let them give glory to him in the meeting of the people and praise among the chiefs
 he makes rivers into waste places and springs of water into a dry land
 he makes a fertile country into a salt waste because of the sins of those who are living there
 he makes a waste land into a place of water and a dry land into water springs
 and there he gives the poor a resting place so that they may make themselves a town
 and put seed in the fields and make vine gardens to give them fruit
 he gives them his blessing so that they are increased greatly and their cattle do not become less
 and when they are made low and crushed by trouble and sorrow
 he puts an end to the pride of kings and sends them wandering in the waste lands where there is no way
 but he puts the poor man on high from his troubles and gives him families like a flock
 the upright see it and are glad the mouth of the sinner is stopped
 let the wise give thought to these things and see the mercies of the lord
 &lta song a psalm of david&gt o god my heart is fixed i will make songs and melody even with my glory
 give out your sounds o corded instruments the dawn will be awaking with my song
 i will give you praise o lord among the peoples i will make melody to you among the nations
 for your mercy is higher than the heavens and your unchanging faith than the clouds
 be lifted up o god higher than the heavens let your glory be over all the earth
 let your right hand be stretched out for salvation and give me an answer so that your loved ones may be safe from danger
 this is the word of the holy god i will be glad i will make shechem a heritage measuring out the valley of succoth
 gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim is the strength of my head judah is my law giver
 moab is my washpot on edom is the resting place of my shoe over philistia will i send out a glad cry
 who will take me into the strong town who will be my guide into edom
 have you not sent us away from you o god and you go not out with our armies
 give us help in our trouble for there is no help in man
 with god we will do great things for by him will our haters be crushed underfoot
 &ltto the chief music maker of david a psalm&gt god of my praise let my prayer be answered
 for the mouth of the sinner is open against me in deceit his tongue has said false things against me
 words of hate are round about me they have made war against me without cause
 for my love they give me back hate but i have given myself to prayer
 they have put on me evil for good hate in exchange for my love
 put an evil man over him and let one be placed at his right hand to say evil of him
 when he is judged let the decision go against him and may his prayer become sin
 let his life be short let another take his position of authority
 let his children have no father and his wife be made a widow
 let his children be wanderers looking to others for their food let them be sent away from the company of their friends
 let his creditor take all his goods and let others have the profit of his work
 let no man have pity on him or give help to his children when he is dead
 let his seed be cut off in the coming generation let their name go out of memory
 let the lord keep in mind the wrongdoing of his fathers and may the sin of his mother have no forgiveness
 let them be ever before the eyes of the lord so that the memory of them may be cut off from the earth
 because he had no mercy but was cruel to the low and the poor designing the death of the broken hearted
 as he took pleasure in cursing so let it come on him and as he had no delight in blessing let it be far from him
 he put on cursing like a robe and it has come into his body like water and into his bones like oil
 let it be to him as a robe which he puts on let it be like a band which is round him at all times
 let this be the reward given to my haters from the lord and to those who say evil of my soul
 but o lord god give me your help because of your name take me out of danger because your mercy is good
 for i am poor and in need and my heart is wounded in me
 i am gone like the shade when it is stretched out i am forced out of my place like a locust
 my knees are feeble for need of food there is no fat on my bones
 as for me they make sport of me shaking their heads when they see me
 give me help o lord my god in your mercy be my saviour
 so that they may see that it is the work of your hand that you lord have done it
 they may give curses but you give blessing when they come up against me put them to shame but let your servant be glad
 let my haters be clothed with shame covering themselves with shame as with a robe
 i will give the lord great praise with my mouth yes i will give praise to him among all the people
 for he is ever at the right hand of the poor to take him out of the hands of those who go after his soul
 &ltfor the chief music maker of david&gt in the lord put i my faith how will you say to my soul go in flight like a bird to the mountain
 see the bows of the evil doers are bent they make ready their arrows on the cord so that they may send them secretly against the upright in heart
 if the bases are broken down what is the upright man to do
 the lord is in his holy temple the lords seat is in heaven his eyes are watching and testing the children of men
 the lord puts the upright and the sinner to the test but he has hate in his soul for the lover of violent acts
 on the evil doer he will send down fire and flames and a burning wind with these will their cup be full
 for the lord is upright he is a lover of righteousness the upright will see his face
 &lta psalm of david&gt the lord said to my lord be seated at my right hand till i put all those who are against you under your feet
 the lord will send out the rod of your strength from zion be king over your haters
 your people give themselves gladly in the day of your power like the dew of the morning on the holy mountains is the army of your young men
 the lord has made an oath and will not take it back you are a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek
 in the day of his wrath kings will be wounded by the lord at your right hand
 he will be judge among the nations the valleys will be full of dead bodies the head over a great country will be wounded by him
 he will take of the stream by the way so his head will be lifted up
 let the lord be praised i will give praise to the lord with all my heart among the upright and in the meeting of the people
 the works of the lord are great searched out by all those who have delight in them
 his work is full of honour and glory and his righteousness is unchanging for ever
 certain for ever is the memory of his wonders the lord is full of pity and mercy
 he has given food to his worshippers he will keep his agreement in mind for ever
 he has made clear to his people the power of his works giving them the heritage of the nations
 the works of his hands are faith and righteousness all his laws are unchanging
 they are fixed for ever and ever they are done in faith and righteousness
 he has sent salvation to his people he has given his word for ever holy is his name and greatly to be feared

 if i let you go out of my thoughts and if i do not put jerusalem before my greatest joy let my tongue be fixed to the roof of my mouth
 o lord keep in mind against the children of edom the day of jerusalem how they said let it be uncovered uncovered even to its base

 you have knowledge when i am seated and when i get up you see my thoughts from far away
 you keep watch over my steps and my sleep and have knowledge of all my ways
 for there is not a word on my tongue which is not clear to you o lord
 i am shut in by you on every side and you have put your hand on me
 such knowledge is a wonder greater than my powers it is so high that i may not come near it
 where may i go from your spirit how may i go in flight from you
 if i go up to heaven you are there or if i make my bed in the underworld you are there
 if i take the wings of the morning and go to the farthest parts of the sea
 even there will i be guided by your hand and your right hand will keep me
 if i say only let me be covered by the dark and the light about me be night
 even the dark is not dark to you the night is as bright as the day for dark and light are the same to you
 my flesh was made by you and my parts joined together in my mothers body
 i will give you praise for i am strangely and delicately formed your works are great wonders and of this my soul is fully conscious
 my frame was not unseen by you when i was made secretly and strangely formed in the lowest parts of the earth
 your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book all my days were recorded even those which were purposed before they had come into being
 how dear are your thoughts to me o god  how great is the number of them 
 if i made up their number it would be more than the grains of sand when i am awake i am still with you
 if only you would put the sinners to death o god go far from me you men of blood
 for they go against you with evil designs and your haters make sport of your name
 are not your haters hated by me o lord are not those who are lifted up against you a cause of grief to me
 my hate for them is complete my thoughts of them are as if they were making war on me
 o god let the secrets of my heart be uncovered and let my wandering thoughts be tested
 see if there is any way of sorrow in me and be my guide in the eternal way
 &ltto the chief music maker of david&gt the foolish man has said in his heart god will not do anything they are unclean they have done evil works there is not one who does good
 the lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men to see if there were any who had wisdom searching after god
 they have all gone out of the way together they are unclean there is not one who does good no not one
 have all the workers of evil no knowledge they take my people for food as they would take bread they make no prayer to the lord
 then were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the upright

 their tongues are sharp like the tongue of a snake the poison of snakes is under their lips  selah 
 o lord take me out of the hands of sinners keep me safe from the violent man for they are designing my downfall
 the men of pride have put secret cords for my feet stretching nets in my way so that they may take me with their tricks  selah 
 i have said to the lord you are my god give ear o lord to the voice of my prayer
 o lord god the strength of my salvation you have been a cover over my head in the day of the fight
 o lord give not the wrongdoer his desire give him no help in his evil designs or he may be uplifted in pride  selah 
 as for those who come round me let their heads be covered by the evil of their lips
 let burning flames come down on them let them be put into the fire and into deep waters so that they may not get up again
 let not a man of evil tongue be safe on earth let destruction overtake the violent man with blow on blow
 i am certain that the lord will take care of the cause of the poor and of the rights of those who are troubled
 truly the upright will give praise to your name the holy will have a place in your house
 &lta psalm of david&gt lord i have made my cry to you come to me quickly give ear to my voice when it goes up to you

 o lord keep a watch over my mouth keep the door of my lips
 keep my heart from desiring any evil thing or from taking part in the sins of the evil doers with men who do wrong and let me have no part in their good things
 let the upright give me punishment and let the god fearing man put me in the right way but i will not let the oil of sinners come on my head when they do evil i will give myself to prayer
 when destruction comes to their judges by the side of the rock they will give ear to my words for they are sweet
 our bones are broken up at the mouth of the underworld as the earth is broken by the plough
 but my eyes are turned to you o lord god my hope is in you let not my soul be given up to death
 keep me from the net which they have put down for me and from the designs of the workers of evil
 let the sinners be taken in the nets which they themselves have put down while i go free
 &ltmaschil of david a prayer when he was in the hole of the rock&gt the sound of my cry went up to the lord with my voice i made my prayer for grace to the lord
 i put all my sorrows before him and made clear to him all my trouble
 when my spirit is overcome your eyes are on my goings nets have been secretly placed in the way in which i go
 looking to my right side i saw no man who was my friend i had no safe place no one had any care for my soul
 i have made my cry to you o lord i have said you are my safe place and my heritage in the land of the living

 my hands are stretched out to you my soul is turned to you like a land in need of water  selah

 &ltto the chief music maker of the servant of the lord of david who said the words of this song to the lord on the day when the lord made him free from the hand of all his haters and from the hand of saul and he said&gt i will give you my love o lord my strength
 the lord is my rock my walled town and my saviour my god my rock in him will i put my faith my breastplate and the horn of my salvation and my high tower
 i will send up my cry to the lord who is to be praised so will i be made safe from those who are against me
 the cords of death were round me and the seas of evil put me in fear
 the cords of hell were round me the nets of death came on me
 in my trouble my voice went up to the lord and my cry to my god my voice came to his hearing in his holy temple and my prayer came before him even into his ears
 then trouble and shock came on the earth and the bases of the mountains were moved and shaking because he was angry
 there went up a smoke from his nose and a fire of destruction from his mouth flames were lighted by it
 the heavens were bent so that he might come down and it was dark under his feet
 and he went in flight through the air seated on a storm cloud going quickly on the wings of the wind
 he made the dark his secret place his tent round him was the dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
 before his shining light his dark clouds went past raining ice and fire
 the lord made thunder in the heavens and the voice of the highest was sounding out a rain of ice and fire
 he sent out his arrows driving them in all directions by his flames of fire they were troubled
 then the deep beds of the waters were seen and the bases of the world were uncovered because of your words of wrath o lord because of the breath from your mouth
 he sent from on high he took me pulling me out of great waters
 he made me free from my strong hater and from those who were against me because they were stronger than i
 they came on me in the day of my trouble but the lord was my support
 he took me out into a wide place he was my saviour because he had delight in me
 the lord gives me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean before him
 for i have kept the ways of the lord i have not been turned away in sin from my god
 for all his decisions were before me and i did not put away his laws from me
 and i was upright before him and i kept myself from sin
 because of this the lord has given me the reward of my righteousness because my hands are clean in his eyes
 on him who has mercy you will have mercy to the upright you will be upright
 he who is holy will see that you are holy but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge
 for you are the saviour of those who are in trouble but eyes full of pride will be made low
 you o lord will be my light by you my god the dark will be made bright for me
 by your help i have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in by the help of my god i have gone over a wall
 as for god his way is completely good the word of the lord is tested he is a breastplate for all those who put their faith in him
 for who is god but the lord or who is a rock but our god
 god puts a strong band about me guiding me in a straight way
 he makes my feet like roes feet and puts me on high places
 he makes my hands expert in war so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms
 you have given me the breastplate of your salvation your right hand has been my support and your mercy has made me great
 you have made my steps wide under me so that my feet are kept from slipping
 i go after my haters and overtake them not turning back till they are all overcome
 i will give them wounds so that they are not able to get up they are stretched under my feet
 for i have been armed by you with strength for the fight you have made low under me those who come out against me
 by you their backs are turned in flight so that my haters are cut off
 they were crying out but there was no one to come to their help even to the lord but he gave them no answer
 then they were crushed as small as dust before the wind they were drained out like the waste of the streets
 you have made me free from the fightings of the people you have made me the head of the nations a people of whom i had no knowledge will be my servants
 from the time when my name comes to their ears they will be ruled by me men of other countries will with false hearts put themselves under my authority
 they will be wasting away they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear
 the lord is living praise be to my rock and let the god of my salvation be honoured
 it is god who sends punishment on my haters and puts peoples under my rule
 he makes me free from my haters i am lifted up over those who come up against me you have made me free from the violent man
 because of this i will give you praise o lord among the nations and will make a song of praise to your name
 great salvation does he give to his king he has mercy on the king of his selection david and on his seed for ever
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt the heavens are sounding the glory of god the arch of the sky makes clear the work of his hands
 day after day it sends out its word and night after night it gives knowledge
 there are no words or language their voice makes no sound
 their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them has he put a tent for the sun
 who is like a newly married man coming from his bride tent and is glad like a strong runner starting on his way
 his going out is from the end of the heaven and his circle to the ends of it there is nothing which is not open to his heat
 the law of the lord is good giving new life to the soul the witness of the lord is certain giving wisdom to the foolish
 the orders of the lord are right making glad the heart the rule of the lord is holy giving light to the eyes
 the fear of the lord is clean and has no end the decisions of the lord are true and full of righteousness
 more to be desired are they than gold even than much shining gold sweeter than the dropping honey
 by them is your servant made conscious of danger and in keeping them there is great reward
 who has full knowledge of his errors make me clean from secret evil
 keep your servant back from sins of pride let them not have rule over me then will i be upright and free from great sin
 let the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing in your eyes o lord my strength and my salvation
 why are the nations so violently moved and why are the thoughts of the people so foolish
 the kings of the earth have taken their place and the rulers are fixed in their purpose against the lord and against the king of his selection saying
 let their chains be broken and their cords taken from off us
 then he whose seat is in the heavens will be laughing the lord will make sport of them
 then will his angry words come to their ears and by his wrath they will be troubled
 but i have put my king on my holy hill of zion
 i will make clear the lords decision he has said to me you are my son this day have i given you being
 make your request to me and i will give you the nations for your heritage and the farthest limits of the earth will be under your hand
 they will be ruled by you with a rod of iron they will be broken like a potters vessel
 so now be wise you kings take his teaching you judges of the earth
 give worship to the lord with fear kissing his feet and giving him honour
 for fear that he may be angry causing destruction to come on you because he is quickly moved to wrath happy are all those who put their faith in him
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt may the lord give ear to you in the day of trouble may you be placed on high by the name of the god of jacob
 may he send you help from the holy place and give you strength from zion
 may he keep all your offerings in mind and be pleased with the fat of your burned offerings  selah 
 may he give you your hearts desire and put all your purposes into effect
 we will be glad in your salvation and in the name of our god we will put up our flags may the lord give you all your requests
 now am i certain that the lord gives salvation to his king he will give him an answer from his holy heaven with the strength of salvation in his right hand
 some put their faith in carriages and some in horses but we will be strong in the name of the lord our god

 the upright will have the earth for their heritage and will go on living there for ever
 the mouth of the good man says words of wisdom the talk of his tongue is of righteousness
 the law of his god is in his heart he will never make a false step
 the sinners are watching the upright man desiring to put him to death
 the lord will not give him into their hands or be against him when he is judged
 be waiting for the lord and keep his way and you will be lifted up and have the land for your heritage when the evil doers are cut off you will see it
 i have seen the evil doer in great power covering the earth like a great tree
 but he came to an end and there was no sign of him i made a search for him and he was not there
 give attention to the good man and take note of the upright because the end of that man is peace
 but as for the sinners they will be cut off together the end of the wrongdoers is destruction

 &lta psalm of david to keep in memory&gt o lord be not bitter with me in your wrath let not your hand be on me in the heat of your passion

 for my crimes have gone over my head they are like a great weight which is more than my strength
 my wounds are poisoned and evil smelling because of my foolish behaviour

 lord all my desire is before you my sorrow is not kept secret from you
 my heart goes out in pain my strength is wasting away as for the light of my eyes it is gone from me
 my lovers and my friends keep away from my disease my relations keep far away
 those who have a desire to take my life put nets for me those who are designing my destruction say evil things against me all the day their minds are full of deceit
 but i kept my ears shut like a man without hearing like a man without a voice never opening his mouth
 so i was like a man whose ears are shut and in whose mouth there are no sharp words
 in you o lord is my hope you will give me an answer o lord my god
 i said let them not be glad over me when my foot is moved let them not be lifted up with pride against me
 my feet are near to falling and my sorrow is ever before me
 i will make clear my wrongdoing with sorrow in my heart for my sin
 but they are strong who have hate for me without cause those who are against me falsely are increased in numbers
 they give me back evil for good they are my haters because i go after the thing which is right
 do not give me up o lord o my god be near to me
 come quickly to give me help o lord my salvation
 &ltto the chief music maker of jeduthun a psalm of david&gt i said i will give attention to my ways so that my tongue may do no wrong i will keep my mouth under control while the sinner is before me

 my heart was burning in my breast while i was deep in thought the fire was lighted then i said with my tongue
 lord give me knowledge of my end and of the measure of my days so that i may see how feeble i am
 you have made my days no longer than a hands measure and my years are nothing in your eyes truly every man is but a breath  selah 
 truly every man goes on his way like an image he is troubled for no purpose he makes a great store of wealth and has no knowledge of who will get it
 and now lord what am i waiting for my hope is in you
 make me free from all my sins do not let me be shamed by the man of evil behaviour
 i was quiet and kept my mouth shut because you had done it
 no longer let your hand be hard on me i am wasted by the blows of your hand
 by the weight of your wrath against mans sin the glory of his form is wasted away truly every man is but a breath  selah 
 let my prayer come to your ears o lord and give attention to my cry make an answer to my weeping for my time here is short before you and in a little time i will be gone like all my fathers
 let your wrath be turned away from me so that i may be comforted before i go away from here and become nothing
 &ltto the chief music maker on corded instruments a psalm of david&gt give answer to my cry o god of my righteousness make me free from my troubles have mercy on me and give ear to my prayer
 o you sons of men how long will you go on turning my glory into shame how long will you give your love to foolish things going after what is false  selah 
 see how the lord has made great his mercy for me the lord will give ear to my cry
 let there be fear in your hearts and do no sin have bitter feelings on your bed but make no sound  selah 
 give the offerings of righteousness and put your faith in the lord
 there are numbers who say who will do us any good the light of his face has gone from us
 lord you have put joy in my heart more than they have when their grain and their wine are increased
 i will take my rest on my bed in peace because you only lord keep me safe
 &ltto the chief music maker of david a psalm&gt when i was waiting quietly for the lord his heart was turned to me and he gave ear to my cry
 he took me up out of a deep waste place out of the soft and sticky earth he put my feet on a rock and made my steps certain
 and he put a new song in my mouth even praise to our god numbers have seen it with fear and put their faith in the lord
 happy is the man who has faith in the lord and does not give honour to the men of pride or to those who are turned away to deceit
 o lord my god great are the wonders which you have done in your thought for us it is not possible to put them out in order before you when i would give an account of them their number is greater than i may say
 you had no desire for offerings of beasts or fruits of the earth ears you made for me for burned offerings and sin offerings you made no request
 then i said see i come it is recorded of me in the roll of the book
 my delight is to do your pleasure o my god truly your law is in my heart
 i have given news of righteousness in the great meeting o lord you have knowledge that i have not kept back my words
 your righteousness has not been folded away in my heart i have made clear your true word and your salvation i have not kept secret your mercy or your faith from the great meeting
 take not away your gentle mercies from me o lord let your mercy and your faith keep me safe for ever
 for unnumbered evils are round about me my sins have overtaken me so that i am bent down with their weight they are more than the hairs of my head my strength is gone because of them
 be pleased o lord to take me out of danger o lord come quickly and give me help
 let those who go after my soul for its destruction have shame and trouble together let them be turned back and made foolish who take pleasure in my trouble
 let those who say to me aha aha  be surprised because of their shame
 let all those who are looking for you be glad and have joy in you let the lovers of your salvation ever say may the lord be great
 though i am poor and in need the lord has me in mind you are my help and my saviour let there be no waiting o my god
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt happy is the man who gives thought to the poor the lord will be his saviour in the time of trouble
 the lord will keep him safe and give him life the lord will let him be a blessing on the earth and will not give him into the hand of his haters
 the lord will be his support on his bed of pain by you will all his grief be turned to strength
 i said lord have mercy on me make my soul well because my faith is in you
 my haters say evil against me when will he be dead and his name come to an end
 if one comes to see me deceit is in his heart he keeps a store of evil which he makes public in every place
 all my haters are talking secretly together against me they are designing my downfall
 they say he has an evil disease which will not let him go and now that he is down he will not get up again
 even my dearest friend in whom i had faith who took bread with me is turned against me
 but you o lord have mercy on me lifting me up so that i may give them their punishment
 by this i see that you have pleasure in me because my hater does not overcome me
 and as for me you are my support in my righteousness giving me a place before your face for ever
 may the lord god of israel be praised through eternal days and for ever so be it so be it
 &ltto the chief music maker maschil of the sons of korah&gt like the desire of the roe for the water streams so is my souls desire for you o god
 my soul is dry for need of god the living god when may i come and see the face of god
 my tears have been my food day and night while they keep saying to me where is your god
 let my soul be overflowing with grief when these things come back to my mind how i went in company to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with the song of those who were keeping the feast
 why are you crushed down o my soul and why are you troubled in me put your hope in god for i will again give him praise who is my help and my god
 my soul is crushed down in me so i will keep you in mind from the land of jordan and of the hermons from the hill mizar
 deep is sounding to deep at the noise of your waterfalls all your waves have gone rolling over me
 but the lord will send his mercy in the daytime and in the night his song will be with me a prayer to the god of my life
 i will say to god my rock why have you let me go from your memory why do i go in sorrow because of the attacks of my haters
 the cruel words of my haters are like a crushing of my bones when they say to me every day where is your god
 why are you crushed down o my soul and why are you troubled in me put your hope in god for i will again give him praise who is my help and my god
 be my judge o god supporting my cause against a nation without religion o keep me from the false and evil man
 you are the god of my strength why have you put me from you why do i go in sorrow because of the attacks of my haters
 o send out your light and your true word let them be my guide let them take me to your holy hill and to your tents
 then i will go up to the altar of god to the god of my joy i will be glad and give praise to you on an instrument of music o god my god
 why are you crushed down o my soul and why are you troubled in me put your hope in god for i will again give him praise who is my help and my god
 &ltto the chief music maker of the sons of korah maschil&gt it has come to our ears o god our fathers have given us the story of the works which you did in their days in the old times
 uprooting the nations with your hand and planting our fathers in their place cutting down the nations but increasing the growth of your people
 for they did not make the land theirs by their swords and it was not their arms which kept them safe but your right hand and your arm and the light of your face because you had pleasure in them
 you are my king and my god ordering salvation for jacob
 through you will we overcome our haters by your name will they be crushed under our feet who are violent against us
 i will not put faith in my bow my sword will not be my salvation
 but it is you who have been our saviour from those who were against us and have put to shame those who had hate for us
 our pride is in god at all times to his name we give praise for ever  selah 
 but now you have sent us away from you and put us to shame you do not go out with our armies
 because of this we are turned back by the attacker those who have hate for us take our goods for themselves
 you have made us like sheep which are taken for meat we are put to flight among the nations
 you let your people go for nothing your wealth is not increased by their price
 you have made us to be looked down on by our neighbours we are laughed at and shamed by those who are round about us
 our name is a word of shame among the nations a sign for the shaking of heads among the peoples
 my downfall is ever before me and i am covered with the shame of my face
 because of the voice of him who says sharp and bitter words because of the hater and him who is the instrument of punishment
 all this has come on us but still we have kept you in our memory and we have not been false to your word
 our hearts have not gone back and our steps have not been turned out of your way
 though you have let us be crushed in the place of jackals though we are covered with darkest shade
 if the name of our god has gone out of our minds or if our hands have been stretched out to a strange god
 will not god make search for it for he sees the secrets of the heart
 truly because of you we are put to death every day we are numbered like sheep for destruction
 why are you sleeping o lord awake  and come to our help do not give us up for ever
 why is your face covered and why do you give no thought to our trouble and our cruel fate
 for our souls are crushed down to the dust our bodies are stretched out on the earth
 up  and come to our help and give us salvation because of your mercy
 &ltto the chief music maker put to shoshannim of the sons of korah maschil a song of loves&gt my heart is flowing over with good things my words are of that which i have made for a king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer

 and go nobly on in your power because you are good and true and without pride and your right hand will be teaching you things of fear

 your seat of power o god is for ever and ever the rod of your kingdom is a rod of honour
 you have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil and so god your god has put the oil of joy on your head lifting you high over all other kings

 in the great house the kings daughter is all shining her clothing is worked with gold
 she will come before the king in robes of needlework the virgins in her train will come before you
 with joy and rapture will they come they will go into the kings house
 your children will take the place of your fathers so that you may make them rulers over all the earth
 i will keep the memory of your name living through all generations and because of this the people will give you praise for ever
 &ltto the chief music maker of the sons of korah put to alamoth a song&gt god is our harbour and our strength a very present help in trouble
 for this cause we will have no fear even though the earth is changed and though the mountains are moved in the heart of the sea
 though its waters are sounding and troubled and though the mountains are shaking with their violent motion  selah 
 there is a river whose streams make glad the resting place of god the holy place of the tents of the most high
 god has taken his place in her she will not be moved he will come to her help at the dawn of morning
 the nations were angry the kingdoms were moved at the sound of his voice the earth became like wax
 the lord of armies is with us the god of jacob is our high tower  selah 
 come see the works of the lord the destruction which he has made in the earth
 he puts an end to wars over all the earth by him the bow is broken and the spear cut in two and the carriage burned in the fire
 be at peace in the knowledge that i am god i will be lifted up among the nations i will be honoured through all the earth
 the lord of armies is with us the god of jacob is our high tower  selah 
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of the sons of korah&gt o make a glad noise with your hands all you peoples letting your voices go up to god with joy
 for the lord most high is to be feared he is a great king over all the earth
 he will put down the peoples under us and the nations under our feet
 he will give us our heritage the glory of jacob who is dear to him  selah 
 god has gone up with a glad cry the lord with the sound of the horn
 give praises to god make songs of praise give praises to our king make songs of praise
 for god is the king of all the earth make songs of praise with knowledge
 god is the ruler over the nations god is on the high seat of his holy rule
 the rulers of the peoples have come together with the people of the god of abraham because the powers of the earth are gods he is lifted up on high
 &lta song a psalm of the sons of korah&gt great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the town of our god in his holy mountain
 beautiful in its high position the joy of all the earth is the mountain of zion the mountain of god the town of the great king
 in its buildings god is seen to be a high tower
 for see  the kings came together by agreement they were joined together
 they saw it and so were full of wonder they were troubled and went quickly away in fear
 shaking came on them and pain as on a woman in childbirth
 by you the ships of tarshish are broken as by an east wind
 as it came to our ears so have we seen it in the town of the lord of armies in the town of our god god will keep it fixed for ever  selah 
 our thoughts were of your mercy o god while we were in your temple
 as your name is o god so is your praise to the ends of the earth your right hand is full of righteousness
 let there be joy in the mountain of zion and let the daughters of judah be glad because of your wise decisions
 make your way about zion and go round it numbering its towers
 take note of its strong walls looking well at its fair buildings so that you may give word of it to the generation which comes after
 because this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide
 &ltalamoth to the chief music maker of the sons of korah a psalm&gt give attention to this all you peoples let your ears be open all you who are living in the world
 high and low together the poor and those who have wealth
 from my mouth will come words of wisdom and in the thoughts of my heart will be knowledge
 i will put my teaching into a story i will make my dark sayings clear with music
 what cause have i for fear in the days of evil when the evil doing of those who are working for my downfall is round about me
 even of those whose faith is in their wealth and whose hearts are lifted up because of their stores
 truly no man may get back his soul for a price or give to god the payment for himself
  because it takes a great price to keep his soul from death and man is not able to give it 
 so that he might have eternal life and never see the underworld
 for he sees that wise men come to their end and foolish persons of low behaviour come to destruction together letting their wealth go to others
 the place of the dead is their house for ever and their resting place through all generations those who come after them give their names to their lands
 but man like the animals does not go on for ever he comes to an end like the beasts
 this is the way of the foolish their silver is for those who come after them and their children get the pleasure of their gold  selah 
 death will give them their food like sheep the underworld is their fate and they will go down into it their flesh is food for worms their form is wasted away the underworld is their resting place for ever
 but god will get back my soul for he will take me from the power of death  selah 
 have no fear when wealth comes to a man and the glory of his house is increased
 for at his death he will take nothing away his glory will not go down after him
 though he might have pride in his soul in his life time and men will give you praise if you do well for yourself
 he will go to the generation of his fathers he will not see the light again
 man like the animals does not go on for ever he comes to an end like the beasts
 &ltto the chief music maker on wind instruments a psalm of david&gt give ear to my words o lord give thought to my heart searchings
 let the voice of my cry come to you my king and my god for to you will i make my prayer
 my voice will come to you in the morning o lord in the morning will i send my prayer to you and keep watch
 for you are not a god who takes pleasure in wrongdoing there is no evil with you
 the sons of pride have no place before you you are a hater of all workers of evil
 you will send destruction on those whose words are false the cruel man and the man of deceit are hated by the lord
 but as for me i will come into your house in the full measure of your mercy and in your fear i will give worship turning my eyes to your holy temple
 be my guide o lord in the ways of your righteousness because of those who are against me make your way straight before my face
 for no faith may be put in their words their inner part is nothing but evil their throat is like an open place for the dead smooth are the words of their tongues
 send them to destruction o lord let their evil designs be the cause of their fall let them be forced out by all their sins because they have gone against your authority
 but let all those who put their faith in you be glad with cries of joy at all times and let all the lovers of your name be glad in you
 for you lord will send a blessing on the upright man your grace will be round him and you will be his strength
 &lta psalm of asaph&gt the god of gods even the lord has sent out his voice and the earth is full of fear from the coming up of the sun to its going down
 from zion most beautiful of places god has sent out his light
 our god will come and will not keep quiet with fire burning before him and storm winds round him
 his voice will go out to the heavens and to the earth for the judging of his people
 let my saints come together to me those who have made an agreement with me by offerings
 and let the heavens make clear his righteousness for god himself is the judge  selah 
 give ear o my people to my words o israel i will be a witness against you i am god even your god
 i will not take up a cause against you because of your offerings or because of your burned offerings which are ever before me
 i will take no ox out of your house or he goats from your flocks
 for every beast of the woodland is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills
 i see all the birds of the mountains and the beasts of the field are mine
 if i had need of food i would not give you word of it for the earth is mine and all its wealth
 am i to take the flesh of the ox for my food or the blood of goats for my drink
 make an offering of praise to god keep the agreements which you have made with the most high
 let your voice come up to me in the day of trouble i will be your saviour so that you may give glory to me
 but to the sinner god says what are you doing talking of my laws or taking the words of my agreement in your mouth
 seeing that you have no desire for my teaching turning your back on my words
 when you saw a thief you were in agreement with him and you were joined with those who took other mens wives
 you have given your mouth to evil your tongue to words of deceit
 you say evil of your brother you make false statements against your mothers son
 these things have you done and i said nothing it seemed to you that i was such a one as yourself but i will make a protest against you and put them in order before your eyes
 now keep this in mind you who have no memory of god for fear that you may be crushed under my hand with no one to give you help
 whoever makes an offering of praise gives glory to me and to him who is upright in his ways i will make clear the salvation of god
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david when nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone in to bath sheba&gt have pity on me o god in your mercy out of a full heart take away my sin
 let all my wrongdoing be washed away and make me clean from evil
 for i am conscious of my error my sin is ever before me
 against you you only have i done wrong working that which is evil in your eyes so that your words may be seen to be right and you may be clear when you are judging
 truly i was formed in evil and in sin did my mother give me birth
 your desire is for what is true in the inner parts in the secrets of my soul you will give me knowledge of wisdom
 make me free from sin with hyssop let me be washed whiter than snow
 make me full of joy and rapture so that the bones which have been broken may be glad
 let your face be turned from my wrongdoing and take away all my sins
 make a clean heart in me o god give me a right spirit again
 do not put me away from before you or take your holy spirit from me
 give me back the joy of your salvation let a free spirit be my support
 then will i make your ways clear to wrongdoers and sinners will be turned to you
 be my saviour from violent death o god the god of my salvation and my tongue will give praise to your righteousness
 o lord let my lips be open so that my mouth may make clear your praise
 you have no desire for an offering or i would give it you have no delight in burned offerings
 the offerings of god are a broken spirit a broken and sorrowing heart o god you will not put from you
 do good to zion in your good pleasure building up the walls of jerusalem
 then you will have delight in the offerings of righteousness in burned offerings and offerings of beasts then they will make offerings of oxen on your altar
 &ltto the chief music maker maschil of david when doeg the edomite came to saul saying david has come to the house of ahimelech&gt why do you take pride in wrongdoing lifting yourself up against the upright man all the day
 purposing destruction using deceit your tongue is like a sharp blade
 you have more love for evil than for good for deceit than for works of righteousness  selah 
 destruction is in all your words o false tongue
 but god will put an end to you for ever driving you out from your tent uprooting you from the land of the living  selah 
 the upright will see it with fear and will say laughing at you
 see this is the man who did not make god his strength but had faith in his goods and his property and made himself strong in his wealth
 but i am like a branching olive tree in the house of god i have put my faith in his mercy for ever and ever
 i will give you praise without end for what you have done i will give honour to your name before your saints for it is good
 &ltto the chief music maker put to mahalath maschil of david&gt the foolish man has said in his heart god will not do anything they are unclean they have done evil works there is not one who does good
 god was looking down from heaven on the children of men to see if there were any who had wisdom searching after god
 every one of them has gone back they are unclean there is not one who does good no not one
 have the workers of evil no knowledge they take my people for food as they would take bread they make no prayer to god
 they were in great fear where there was no cause for fear for the bones of those who make war on you have been broken by god you have put them to shame because god has no desire for them
 may the salvation of israel come out of zion  when the fate of his people is changed by god jacob will have joy and israel will be glad
 &ltto the chief music maker on neginoth maschil of david when the ziphites came and said to saul is not david keeping himself secret among us&gt let your name be my salvation o god let my cause be judged by your strength
 let my prayer come before you o god give ear to the words of my mouth
 for men who are going after me have come out against me violent men are purposing to take my soul they have not put god before their eyes  selah

 give thought to me and let my prayer be answered i have been made low in sorrow
 i am troubled because of the voice of the cruel ones because of the loud cry of the evil doers for they put a weight of evil on me and they are cruel in their hate for me
 my heart is deeply wounded and the fear of death has come on me
 fear and shaking have come over me with deep fear i am covered
 and i said if only i had wings like a dove  for then i would go in flight from here and be at rest
 i would go wandering far away living in the waste land  selah 
 i would quickly take cover from the driving storm and from the violent wind
 send destruction on them o lord make a division of tongues among them for i have seen fighting and violent acts in the town
 by day and night they go round the town on the walls trouble and sorrow are in the heart of it
 evil is there cruel rule and deceit are ever in the streets
 for it was not my hater who said evil of me that would have been no grief to me it was not one outside the number of my friends who made himself strong against me or i would have kept myself from him in a secret place
 but it was you my equal my guide my well loved friend
 we had loving talk together and went to the house of god in company
 let the hand of death come on them suddenly and let them go down living into the underworld because evil is in their houses and in their hearts
 as for me i will make my prayer to god and he will be my saviour
 in the evening and in the morning and in the middle of the day i will make my prayer with sounds of grief and my voice will come to his ears
 he has taken my soul away from the attack which was made against me and given it peace for great numbers were against me
 god will give thought to me he who from early times is strong will send pain and trouble on them  selah  because they are unchanged they have no fear of god
 he has put out his hand against those who were at peace with him he has not kept his agreement
 the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil but they were sharp swords
 put your cares on the lord and he will be your support he will not let the upright man be moved
 but you o god will send them down into the underworld the cruel and the false will be cut off before half their days are ended but i will have faith in you

 their poison is like the poison of a snake they are like the adder whose ears are shut
 who will not be moved by the voice of the wonder worker however great are his powers
 o god let their teeth be broken in their mouths let the great teeth of the young lions be pulled out o lord
 let them be turned to liquid like the ever flowing waters let them be cut off like the grass by the way
 let them be like an after birth which is turned to water and comes to an end like the fruit of a woman who gives birth before her time let them not see the sun
 before they are conscious of it let them be cut down like thorns let a strong wind take them away like waste growth

 but the king will have joy in god everyone who takes an oath by him will have cause for pride but the false mouth will be stopped
 &ltto the chief music maker a psalm of david&gt o god let the voice of my grief come to your ear keep my life from the fear of those who are against me
 keep me safe from the secret purpose of wrongdoers from the band of the workers of evil
 who make their tongues sharp like a sword and whose arrows are pointed even bitter words
 so that in secret they may let loose their arrows at the upright suddenly and unseen
 they make themselves strong in an evil purpose they make holes for secret nets they say who will see it
 or make discovery of our secret purpose the design is framed with care and the inner thought of a man and his heart is deep
 but god sends out an arrow against them suddenly they are wounded
 the evil of their tongues is the cause of their fall all those who see them are shaking their heads at them
 and in fear men make public the works of god and giving thought to his acts they get wisdom
 the upright will be glad in the lord and have hope in him and all the lovers of righteousness will give him glory

 &ltto the chief music maker put to shoshannim of david&gt be my saviour o god because the waters have come in even to my neck
 my feet are deep in the soft earth where there is no support i have come into deep waters the waves are flowing over me
 i am tired with my crying my throat is burning my eyes are wasted with waiting for my god
 those who have hate for me without cause are greater in number than the hairs of my head those who are against me falsely desiring my destruction are very strong i gave back what i had not taken away
 o god you see how foolish i am and my wrongdoing is clear to you
 let not those who have hope in you be put to shame because of me o lord god of armies let not those who are waiting for you be made low because of me o god of israel

 i am on fire with passion for your house and the hard things which are said about you have come on me
 my bitter weeping and my going without food were turned to my shame
 when i put on the clothing of grief they said evil of me
 i am a cause of wonder to those in authority a song to those who are given to strong drink
 but as for me let my prayer be made to you o lord at a time when you are pleased o god give me an answer in your great mercy for your salvation is certain
 take me from the grip of the sticky earth so that i may not go down into it let me be lifted up from the deep waters
 let me not be covered by the flowing waters let not the deep waters go over my head and let me not be shut up in the underworld

 my heart is broken by bitter words i am full of grief i made a search for some to have pity on me but there was no one i had no comforter
 they gave me poison for my food and bitter wine for my drink
 let their table before them be for their destruction let their feasts become a net to take them
 let their eyes be blind so that they may not see let their bodies for ever be shaking
 let your curse come on them let the heat of your wrath overtake them
 give their houses to destruction and let there be no one in their tents
 because they are cruel to him against whom your hand is turned they make bitter the grief of him who is wounded by you
 let their punishment be increased let them not come into your righteousness
 let their names be taken from the book of the living let them not be numbered with the upright
 but i am poor and full of sorrow let me be lifted up by your salvation o lord
 i will give praise to the name of god with a song i will give glory to him for what he has done
 this will be more pleasing to the lord than an ox or a young ox of full growth
 the poor will see it and be glad you who are lovers of god let your hearts have life
 for the ears of the lord are open to the poor and he takes thought for his prisoners
 let the heavens and the earth give praise to him the seas and everything moving in them

 god is the judge of the upright and is angry with the evil doers every day
 if a man is not turned from his evil he will make his sword sharp his bow is bent and ready
 he has made ready for him the instruments of death he makes his arrows flames of fire
 that man is a worker of evil the seed of wrongdoing has given birth to deceit
 he has made a hole deep in the earth and is falling into the hole which he has made

 the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended &lta psalm of asaph&gt
 truly god is good to israel even to such as are clean in heart
 but as for me my feet had almost gone from under me i was near to slipping
 because of my envy of the men of pride when i saw the well being of the wrongdoers
 for they have no pain their bodies are fat and strong
 they are not in trouble as others are they have no part in the unhappy fate of men
 for this reason pride is round them like a chain they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe
 their eyes are bursting with fat they have more than their hearts desire
 their thoughts are deep with evil designs their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts
 their mouth goes up to heaven their tongues go walking through the earth
 for this reason they are full of bread and water is ever flowing for them
 and they say how will the lord see this is there knowledge in the most high
 truly such are the sinners they do well at all times and their wealth is increased
 as for me i have made my heart clean to no purpose washing my hands in righteousness
 for i have been troubled all the day every morning have i undergone punishment
 if i would make clear what it is like i would say you are false to the generation of your children
 when my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this it was a weariness in my eyes
 till i went into gods holy place and saw the end of the evil doers
 you put their feet where there was danger of slipping so that they go down into destruction
 how suddenly are they wasted  fears are the cause of their destruction
 as a dream when one is awake they are ended they are like an image gone out of mind when sleep is over
 my heart was made bitter and i was pained by the bite of grief
 as for me i was foolish and without knowledge i was like a beast before you
 but still i am ever with you you have taken me by my right hand
 your wisdom will be my guide and later you will put me in a place of honour
 whom have i in heaven but you and having you i have no desire for anything on earth
 my flesh and my heart are wasting away but god is the rock of my heart and my eternal heritage
 for those who are far away from you will come to destruction you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you
 but it is good for me to come near to god i have put my faith in the lord god so that i may make clear all his works
 &ltmaschil of asaph&gt of god why have you put us away from you for ever why is the fire of your wrath smoking against the sheep who are your care
 keep in mind your band of worshippers for whom you gave payment in the days which are past whom you took for yourself as the people of your heritage even this mountain of zion which has been your resting place
 go up and see the unending destruction all the evil which your haters have done in the holy place
 sending out their voices like lions among your worshippers they have put up their signs to be seen
 they are cutting down like a man whose blade is lifted up against the thick trees
 your doors are broken down with hammers and iron blades
 they have put on fire your holy place they have made the place of your name unclean pulling it down to the earth
 they have said in their hearts let us put an end to them all together they have given over to the fire all gods places of worship in the land
 we do not see our signs there is no longer any prophet or anyone among us to say how long
 o god how long will those who are against us say cruel things will the hater go on looking down on your name for ever
 why are you keeping back your hand and covering your right hand in your robe
 for from the past god is my king working salvation in the earth
 the sea was parted in two by your strength the heads of the great sea beasts were broken
 the heads of the great snake were crushed by you you gave them as food to the fishes of the sea
 you made valleys for fountains and springs you made the ever flowing rivers dry
 the day is yours and the night is yours you made the light and the sun
 by you all the limits of the earth were fixed you have made summer and winter
 keep this in mind o lord that your haters have said cruel things and that your name has been looked down on by a people of evil behaviour
 o give not the soul of your dove to the hawk let not the life of the poor go out of your memory for ever
 keep in mind your undertaking for the dark places of the earth are full of pride and cruel acts
 o let not the crushed be turned back in shame let the low man and the poor give praise to your name
 up  o god be the judge of your cause keep in mind the bitter things which the man of evil behaviour says against you every day
 keep in mind the voice of your haters the outcry of those who come against you goes up every day

 i say to the men of pride let your pride be gone and to the sinners let not your horn be lifted up
 let not your horn be lifted up let no more words of pride come from your outstretched necks
 for honour does not come from the east or from the west or uplifting from the south
 but god is the judge putting down one and lifting up another
 for in the hand of the lord is a cup and the wine is red it is well mixed overflowing from his hand he will make all the sinners of the earth take of it even to the last drop
 but i will ever be full of joy making songs of praise to the god of jacob
 by him will all the horns of the sinners be cut off but the horns of the upright will be lifted up

 &ltto the chief music maker after jeduthun of asaph a psalm&gt i was crying to god with my voice even to god with my voice and he gave ear to me
 in the day of my trouble my heart was turned to the lord my hand was stretched out in the night without resting my soul would not be comforted
 i will keep god in memory with sounds of grief my thoughts are troubled and my spirit is overcome  selah 
 you keep my eyes from sleep i am so troubled that no words come
 my thoughts go back to the days of the past to the years which are gone
 the memory of my song comes back to me in the night my thoughts are moving in my heart my spirit is searching with care
 will the lord put me away for ever will he be kind no longer
 is his mercy quite gone for ever has his word come to nothing
 has god put away the memory of his pity are his mercies shut up by his wrath  selah 
 and i said it is a weight on my spirit but i will keep in mind the years of the right hand of the most high
 i will keep in mind the works of jah i will keep the memory of your wonders in the past
 i will give thought to all your work while my mind goes over your acts of power
 your way o god is holy what god is so great as our god
 you are the god who does works of power you have made your strength clear to the nations
 with your arm you have made your people free the sons of jacob and joseph  selah 
 the waters saw you o god the waters saw you they were in fear even the deep was troubled
 the clouds sent out water the skies gave out a sound truly your arrows went far and wide
 the voice of your thunder went rolling on the world was flaming with the light of the storm the earth was shaking
 your way was in the sea and your road in the great waters there was no knowledge of your footsteps
 you were guiding your people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron
 &ltmaschil of asaph&gt give ear o my people to my law let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth
 opening my mouth i will give out a story even the dark sayings of old times
 which have come to our hearing and our knowledge as they were given to us by our fathers
 we will not keep them secret from our children we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the lord and his strength and the great works of wonder which he has done
 he put up a witness in jacob and made a law in israel which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children
 so that the generation to come might have knowledge of them even the children of the future who would give word of them to their children
 so that they might put their hope in god and not let gods works go out of their minds but keep his laws
 and not be like their fathers a stiff necked and uncontrolled generation a generation whose heart was hard whose spirit was not true to god
 the children of ephraim armed with bows were turned back on the day of the fight
 they were not ruled by gods word and they would not go in the way of his law
 they let his works go out of their memory and the wonders which he had made them see
 he did great works before the eyes of their fathers in the land of egypt in the fields of zoan
 the sea was cut in two so that they might go through the waters were massed together on this side and on that
 in the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud and all through the night with a light of fire
 the rocks of the waste land were broken by his power and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters
 he made streams come out of the rock and waters came flowing down like rivers
 and they went on sinning against him even more turning away from the most high in the waste land
 testing god in their hearts requesting meat for their desire
 they said bitter words against god saying is god able to make ready a table in the waste land
 see the rock was cut open by his power so that the water came rushing out and overflowing streams is he able to give us bread is he able to get meat for his people
 so these things came to the lords ears and he was angry and a fire was lighted against jacob and wrath came up against israel
 because they had no faith in god and no hope in his salvation
 and he gave orders to the clouds on high and the doors of heaven were open
 and he sent down manna like rain for their food and gave them the grain of heaven
 man took part in the food of strong ones he sent them meat in full measure
 he sent an east wind from heaven driving on the south wind by his power
 he sent down meat on them like dust and feathered birds like the sand of the sea
 and he let it come down into their resting place round about their tents
 so they had food and were full for he gave them their desire
 but they were not turned from their desires and while the food was still in their mouths
 the wrath of god came on them and put to death the fattest of them and put an end to the young men of israel
 for all this they went on sinning even more and had no faith in his great wonders
 so their days were wasted like a breath and their years in trouble
 when he sent death on them then they made search for him turning to him and looking for him with care
 in the memory that god was their rock and the most high god their saviour
 but their lips were false to him and their tongues were untrue to him
 and their hearts were not right with him and they did not keep their agreement with him
 but he being full of pity has forgiveness for sin and does not put an end to man frequently turning back his wrath and not being violently angry
 so he kept in mind that they were only flesh a breath which is quickly gone and will not come again
 how frequently did they go against him in the waste land and give him cause for grief in the dry places 
 again they put god to the test and gave pain to the holy one of israel
 they did not keep in mind the work of his hand or the day when he took them from the power of their haters
 how he had done his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan
 so that their rivers were turned to blood and they were not able to get drink from their streams
 he sent different sorts of flies among them poisoning their flesh and frogs for their destruction
 he gave the increase of their fields to worms the fruits of their industry to the locusts
 he sent ice for the destruction of their vines their trees were damaged by the bitter cold
 ice was rained down on their cattle thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks
 he sent on them the heat of his wrath his bitter disgust letting loose evil angels among them
 he let his wrath have its way he did not keep back their soul from death but gave their life to disease
 he gave to destruction all the first sons of egypt the first fruits of their strength in the tents of ham
 but he took his people out like sheep guiding them in the waste land like a flock
 he took them on safely so that they had no fear but their haters were covered by the sea
 and he was their guide to his holy land even to the mountain which his right hand had made his
 driving out nations before them marking out the line of their heritage and giving the people of israel their tents for a resting place
 but they were bitter against the most high god testing him and not keeping his laws
 their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers they were turned to one side like a twisted bow
 they made him angry with their high places moving him to wrath with their images
 when this came to gods ears he was very angry and gave up israel completely
 so that he went away from the holy place in shiloh the tent which he had put among men
 and he let his strength be taken prisoner and gave his glory into the hands of his hater
 he gave his people up to the sword and was angry with his heritage
 their young men were burned in the fire and their virgins were not praised in the bride song
 their priests were put to death by the sword and their widows made no weeping for them
 then was the lord like one awaking from sleep and like a strong man crying out because of wine
 his haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever
 and he put the tent of joseph on one side and took not the tribe of ephraim
 but he took the tribe of judah for himself and the mountain of zion in which he had pleasure
 and he made his holy place like the high heaven like the earth which is fixed by him for ever
 he took david to be his servant taking him from the place of the flocks
 from looking after the sheep which were giving milk he took him to give food to jacob his people and to israel his heritage
 so he gave them food with an upright heart guiding them by the wisdom of his hands
 &lta psalm of asaph&gt o god the nations have come into your heritage they have made your holy temple unclean they have made jerusalem a mass of broken walls
 they have given the bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air and the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth
 their blood has been flowing like water round about jerusalem there was no one to put them in their last resting place
 we are looked down on by our neighbours we are laughed at and made sport of by those who are round us
 how long o lord will you be angry for ever will your wrath go on burning like fire
 let your wrath be on the nations who have no knowledge of you and on the kingdoms who have not made prayer to your name
 for they have taken jacob for their meat and made waste his house
 do not keep in mind against us the sins of our fathers let your mercy come to us quickly for we have been made very low
 give us help o god of our salvation for the glory of your name take us out of danger and give us forgiveness for our sins because of your name
 why may the nations say where is their god let payment for the blood of your servants be made openly among the nations before our eyes
 let the cry of the prisoner come before you with your strong arm make free the children of death
 and give punishment seven times over into the breast of our neighbours for the bitter words which they have said against you o lord
 so we your people and the sheep of your flock will give you glory for ever we will go on praising you through all generations
 &ltto the chief music maker on the gittith a psalm of david&gt o lord our lord whose glory is higher than the heavens how noble is your name in all the earth 
 you have made clear your strength even out of the mouths of babies at the breast because of those who are against you so that you may put to shame the cruel and violent man
 when i see your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have put in their places
 what is man that you keep him in mind the son of man that you take him into account
 for you have made him only a little lower than the gods crowning him with glory and honour
 you have made him ruler over the works of your hands you have put all things under his feet
 all sheep and oxen and all the beasts of the field
 the birds of the air and the fish of the sea and whatever goes through the deep waters of the seas
 o lord our lord how noble is your name in all the earth 
 &ltto the chief music maker put to shoshannim eduth of asaph a psalm&gt give ear o keeper of israel guiding joseph like a flock you who have your seat on the winged ones let your glory be seen
 before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh let your strength be awake from sleep and come as our salvation
 take us back again o god let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
 o lord god of armies how long will your wrath be burning against the rest of your people
 you have given them the bread of weeping for food for their drink you have given them sorrow in great measure
 you make us a cause of war among our neighbours our haters are laughing at us among themselves
 take us back again o god of armies let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
 you took a vine out of egypt driving out the nations and planting it in their land
 you made ready a place for it so that it might take deep root and it sent out its branches over all the land
 the mountains were covered with its shade and the great trees with its branches
 it sent out its arms to the sea and its branches to the river
 why are its walls broken down by your hands so that all who go by may take its fruit
 it is uprooted by the pigs from the woods the beasts of the field get their food from it
 come back o god of armies from heaven let your eyes be turned to this vine and give your mind to it
 even to the tree which was planted by your right hand and to the branch which you made strong for yourself
 it is burned with fire it is cut down they are made waste by the wrath of your face
 let your hand be on the man of your right hand on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself
 so will we not be turned back from you keep us in life and we will give praise to your name
 take us back o lord god of armies let us see the shining of your face and let us be safe
 &ltto the chief music maker put to the gittith of asaph&gt make a song to god our strength make a glad cry to the god of jacob
 take up the melody playing on an instrument of music even on corded instruments
 let the horn be sounded in the time of the new moon at the full moon on our holy feast day
 for this is a rule for israel and a law of the god of jacob
 he gave it to joseph as a witness when he went out over the land of egypt then the words of a strange tongue were sounding in my ears
 i took the weight from his back his hands were made free from the baskets
 you gave a cry in your trouble and i made you free i gave you an answer in the secret place of the thunder i put you to the test at the waters of meribah  selah 
 give ear o my people and i will give you my word o israel if you will only do as i say 
 there is to be no strange god among you you are not to give worship to any other god
 i am the lord your god who took you up from the land of egypt let your mouth be open wide so that i may give you food
 but my people did not give ear to my voice israel would have nothing to do with me
 so i gave them up to the desires of their hearts that they might go after their evil purposes
 if only my people would give ear to me walking in my ways 
 i would quickly overcome their haters my hand would be turned against those who make war on them
 the haters of the lord would be broken and their destruction would be eternal
 i would give them the best grain for food you would be full of honey from the rock
 &lta psalm of asaph&gt god is in the meeting place of god he is judging among the gods

 be the saviour of the poor and those who have nothing take them out of the hand of the evil doers
 they have no knowledge or sense they go about in the dark all the bases of the earth are moved

 up  o god come as judge of the earth for all the nations are your heritage
 &lta song a psalm of asaph&gt o god do not keep quiet let your lips be open and take no rest o god
 for see  those who make war on you are out of control your haters are lifting up their heads
 they have made wise designs against your people talking together against those whom you keep in a secret place
 they have said come let us put an end to them as a nation so that the name of israel may go out of mans memory
 for they have all come to an agreement they are all joined together against you
 the tents of edom and the ishmaelites moab and the hagarites
 gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines and the people of tyre
 assur is joined with them they have become the support of the children of lot  selah 
 do to them what you did to the midianites what you did to sisera and jabin at the stream of kishon
 who came to destruction at en dor their bodies became dust and waste
 make their chiefs like oreb and zeeb and all their rulers like zebah and zalmunna
 who have said let us take for our heritage the resting place of god
 o my god make them like the rolling dust like dry stems before the wind
 as fire burning a wood and as a flame causing fire on the mountains
 so go after them with your strong wind and let them be full of fear because of your storm
 let their faces be full of shame so that they may give honour to your name o lord
 let them be overcome and troubled for ever let them be put to shame and come to destruction
 so that men may see that you only whose name is yahweh are most high over all the earth

 &lta prayer of moses the man of god&gt lord you have been our resting place in all generations
 before the mountains were made before you had given birth to the earth and the world before time was and for ever you are god

 for to you a thousand years are no more than yesterday when it is past and like a watch in the night
 
 in the morning it is green in the evening it is cut down and becomes dry
 we are burned up by the heat of your passion and troubled by your wrath
 you have put our evil doings before you our secret sins in the light of your face
 for all our days have gone by in your wrath our years come to an end like a breath
 the measure of our life is seventy years and if through strength it may be eighty years its pride is only trouble and sorrow for it comes to an end and we are quickly gone
 who has knowledge of the power of your wrath or who takes note of the weight of your passion
 so give us knowledge of the number of our days that we may get a heart of wisdom
 come back o lord how long let your purpose for your servants be changed
 in the morning give us your mercy in full measure so that we may have joy and delight all our days
 make us glad in reward for the days of our sorrow and for the years in which we have seen evil
 make your work clear to your servants and your glory to their children
 let the pleasure of the lord our god be on us o lord give strength to the work of our hands
 happy is he whose resting place is in the secret of the lord and under the shade of the wings of the most high

 he will take you out of the bird net and keep you safe from wasting disease
 you will be covered by his feathers under his wings you will be safe his good faith will be your salvation
 you will have no fear of the evil things of the night or of the arrow in flight by day
 or of the disease which takes men in the dark or of the destruction which makes waste when the sun is high
 you will see a thousand falling by your side and ten thousand at your right hand but it will not come near you
 only with your eyes will you see the reward of the evil doers
 because you have said i am in the hands of the lord the most high is my safe resting place
 no evil will come on you and no disease will come near your tent
 for he will give you into the care of his angels to keep you wherever you go
 in their hands they will keep you up so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone
 you will put your foot on the lion and the snake the young lion and the great snake will be crushed under your feet
 because he has given me his love i will take him out of danger i will put him in a place of honour because he has kept my name in his heart
 when his cry comes up to me i will give him an answer i will be with him in trouble i will make him free from danger and give him honour
 with long life will he be rewarded and i will let him see my salvation
 &lta psalm a song for the sabbath&gt it is a good thing to give praise to the lord and to make melody to your name o most high
 to make clear your mercy in the morning and your unchanging faith every night
 on a ten corded instrument and on an instrument of music with a quiet sound
 for you o lord have made me glad through your work i will have joy in the works of your hands
 o lord how great are your works  and your thoughts are very deep
 a man without sense has no knowledge of this and a foolish man may not take it in
 when the sinners come up like the grass and all the workers of evil do well for themselves it is so that their end may be eternal destruction
 but you o lord are on high for ever
 for see  your haters o lord will be put to death all the workers of evil will be put to flight
 but my horn is lifted up like the horn of the ox the best oil is flowing on my head
 my eyes have seen trouble come on my haters my ears have news of the fate of the evil doers who have come up against me
 the good man will be like a tall tree in his strength his growth will be as the wide stretching trees of lebanon
 those who are planted in the house of the lord will come up tall and strong in his gardens
 they will give fruit even when they are old they will be fertile and full of growth
 for a sign that the lord is upright he is my rock there is no deceit in him
 the lord is king he is clothed with glory the lord is clothed with strength power is the cord of his robe the world is fixed so that it may not be moved
 the seat of your power has been from the past you are eternal
 the rivers send up o lord the rivers send up their voices they send them up with a loud cry
 the lord in heaven is stronger than the noise of great waters yes he is stronger than the great waves of the sea
 your witness is most certain it is right for your house to be holy o lord for ever
 o god in whose hands is punishment o god of punishment let your shining face be seen
 be lifted up o judge of the earth let their reward come to the men of pride
 how long will sinners o lord how long will sinners have joy over us
 words of pride come from their lips all the workers of evil say great things of themselves
 your people are crushed by them o lord your heritage is troubled
 they put to death the widow and the guest they take the lives of children who have no father
 and they say jah will not see it the god of jacob will not give thought to it
 give your mind to my words you who are without wisdom among the people you foolish men when will you be wise
 has he by whom your ears were planted no hearing or is he blind by whom your eyes were formed
 he who is the judge of the nations will he not give men the reward of their acts even he who gives knowledge to man
 the lord has knowledge of the thoughts of man for they are only a breath
 happy is the man who is guided by you o jah and to whom you give teaching out of your law
 so that you may give him rest from the days of evil till a hole is made ready for the destruction of the sinners
 the lord will not give up his people or take away his support from his heritage
 but decisions will again be made in righteousness and they will be kept by all whose hearts are true
 who will give me help against the sinners and who will be my support against the workers of evil
 if the lord had not been my helper my soul would quickly have gone down into death
 if i say my foot is slipping your mercy o lord is my support
 among all my troubled thoughts your comforts are the delight of my soul
 what part with you has the seat of sin which makes evil into a law
 they are banded together against the soul of the upright to give decisions against those who have done no wrong
 but the lord is my safe resting place my god is the rock where i am safe
 and he has made their evil designs come back on themselves cutting them off in their sin the lord our god will put an end to them

 o come let us give worship falling down on our knees before the lord our maker
 for he is our god and we are the people to whom he gives food and the sheep of his flock today if you would only give ear to his voice 
 let not your hearts be hard as at meribah as in the day of massah in the waste land
 when your fathers put me to the test and saw my power and my work
 for forty years i was angry with this generation and said they are a people whose hearts are turned away from me for they have no knowledge of my ways
 and i made an oath in my wrath that they might not come into my place of rest
 o make a new song to the lord let all the earth make melody to the lord

 the heavens gave out the news of his righteousness and all the people saw his glory
 shamed be all those who give worship to images and take pride in false gods give him worship all you gods

 for you lord are most high over the earth you are lifted up over all other gods

 light is shining on the lovers of righteousness and for the upright in heart there is joy
 be glad in the lord you upright men praising the memory of his holy name
 &lta psalm&gt o make a new song to the lord because he has done works of wonder with his right hand and with his holy arm he has overcome

 you gave them an answer o lord our god you took away their sin though you gave them punishment for their wrongdoing
 give high honour to the lord our god worshipping with your faces turned to his holy hill for the lord our god is holy
 now there came a time in the days of the judges when there was no food in the land and a certain man went from beth lehem judah he and his wife and his two sons to make a living place in the country of moab
 and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of beth lehem judah and they came into the country of moab and were there for some time
 and elimelech naomis husband came to his end and only her two sons were with her
 and they took two women of moab as their wives the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they went on living there for about ten years
 and mahlon and chilion came to their end and the woman was without her two sons and her husband
 so she and her daughters in law got ready to go back from the country of moab for news had come to her in the country of moab that the lord in mercy for his people had given them food
 and she went out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on their way to go back to the land of judah
 and naomi said to her two daughters in law go back to your mothers houses may the lord be good to you as you have been good to the dead and to me
 may the lord give you rest in the houses of your husbands then she gave them a kiss and they were weeping bitterly
 and they said to her no but we will go back with you to your people
 but naomi said go back my daughters why will you come with me have i more sons in my body to become your husbands
 go back my daughters and go on your way i am so old now that i may not have another husband if i said i have hopes if i had a husband tonight and might have sons
 would you keep yourselves till they were old enough would you keep from having husbands for them no my daughters but i am very sad for you that the hand of the lord is against me
 then again they were weeping and orpah gave her mother in law a kiss but ruth would not be parted from her
 and naomi said see your sister in law has gone back to her people and to her gods go back after your sister in law
 but ruth said give up requesting me to go away from you or to go back without you for where you go i will go and where you take your rest i will take my rest your people will be my people and your god my god
 wherever death comes to you death will come to me and there will be my last resting place the lord do so to me and more if we are parted by anything but death
 and when she saw that ruth was strong in her purpose to go with her she said no more
 so the two of them went on till they came to beth lehem and when they came to beth lehem all the town was moved about them and they said is this naomi
 and she said to them do not let my name be naomi but mara for the ruler of all has given me a bitter fate
 i went out full and the lord has sent me back again with nothing why do you give me the name naomi seeing that the lord has given witness against me and the ruler of all has sent sorrow on me
 so naomi came back out of the country of moab and ruth the moabitess her daughter in law with her and they came to beth lehem in the first days of the grain cutting
 and naomi had a relation of her husband a man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz
 and ruth the moabitess said to naomi now let me go into the field and take up the heads of grain after him in whose eyes i may have grace and she said to her go my daughter
 and she went and came and took up the heads of grain in the field after the cutters and by chance she went into that part of the field which was the property of boaz who was of the family of elimelech
 and boaz came from beth lehem and said to the grain cutters the lord be with you and they made answer the lord give you his blessing
 then boaz said to his servant who was in authority over the cutters whose girl is this
 and the servant who was in authority over the cutters said it is a moabite girl who came back with naomi out of the country of moab
 and she said to me let me come into the grain field and take up the grain after the cutters so she came and has been here from morning till now without resting even for a minute
 then said boaz to ruth give ear to me my daughter do not go to take up the grain in another field or go away from here but keep here by my young women
 keep your eyes on the field they are cutting and go after them have i not given orders to the young men not to put a hand on you and when you are in need of drink go to the vessels and take of what the young men have put there
 then she went down on her face to the earth and said to him why have i grace in your eyes that you give attention to me seeing i am from a strange people
 and boaz answering said to her i have had news of everything you have done for your mother in law after the death of your husband how you went away from your father and mother and the land of your birth and came to a people who are strange to you
 the lord give you a reward for what you have done and may a full reward be given to you by the lord the god of israel under whose wings you have come to take cover
 then she said may i have grace in your eyes my lord for you have given me comfort and you have said kind words to your servant though i am not like one of your servants
 and at meal time boaz said to her come here and take some of the bread and put your bit into the wine and she took her seat among the grain cutters and he gave her dry grain and she took it and there was more than enough for her meal
 and when she got ready to take up the grain boaz gave his young men orders saying let her take it even from among the cut grain and say nothing to her
 and let some heads of grain be pulled out of what has been corded up and dropped for her to take and let no sharp word be said to her
 so she went on getting together the heads of grain till evening and after crushing out the seed it came to about an ephah of grain
 and she took it up and went into the town and she let her mother in law see what she had got and after taking enough for herself she gave her the rest
 and her mother in law said to her where did you take up the grain today and where were you working may a blessing be on him who gave such attention to you and she gave her mother in law an account of where she had been working and said the name of the man with whom i was working today is boaz
 and naomi said to her daughter in law may the blessing of the lord who has at all times been kind to the living and to the dead be on him and naomi said to her the man is of our family one of our near relations
 and ruth the moabitess said truly he said to me keep near my young men till all my grain is cut
 and naomi said to ruth her daughter in law it is better my daughter for you to go out with his servant girls so that no danger may come to you in another field
 so she kept near the servant girls of boaz to take up the grain till the cutting of the early grain and the cutting of the late grain were ended and she went on living with her mother in law
 and naomi her mother in law said to her my daughter am i not to get you a resting place where you may be in comfort
 and now is there not boaz our relation with whose young women you were see tonight he is separating the grain from the waste in his grain floor
 so take a bath and after rubbing your body with sweet oil put on your best robe and go down to the grain floor but do not let him see you till he has come to the end of his meal
 but see to it when he goes to rest that you take note of the place where he is sleeping and go in there and uncovering his feet take your place by him and he will say what you are to do
 and she said i will do all you say
 so she went down to the grain floor and did all her mother in law had said to her
 now when boaz had taken meat and drink and his heart was glad he went to take his rest at the end of the mass of grain then she came softly and uncovering his feet went to rest
 now in the middle of the night the man awaking from his sleep in fear and lifting himself up saw a woman stretched at his feet
 and he said who are you and she answering said i am your servant ruth take your servant as wife for you are a near relation
 and he said may the lord give you his blessing my daughter even better than what you did at the first is this last kind act you have done in not going after young men with or without wealth
 and now my daughter have no fear i will do for you whatever you say for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue
 now it is true that i am a near relation but there is a relation nearer than i
 take your rest here tonight and in the morning if he will do for you what it is right for a relation to do very well let him do so but if he will not then by the living lord i myself will do so
 and she took her rest at his feet till the morning and she got up before it was light enough for one to see another and he said let it not come to anyones knowledge that the woman came to the grain floor
 and he said take your robe stretching it out in your hands and she did so and he took six measures of grain and put them into it and gave it her to take and she went back to the town
 and when she came back her mother in law said to her how did it go with you my daughter and she gave her an account of all the man had done to her
 and she said he gave me these six measures of grain saying do not go back to your mother in law with nothing in your hands
 then she said do nothing now my daughter till you see what will come of this for the man will take no rest till he has put this thing through
 and boaz went up to the public place of the town and took his seat there and the near relation of whom he had been talking came by and boaz crying out to him by name said come and be seated here and he came and was seated
 then he got ten of the responsible men of the town and said be seated here and they took their seats
 then he said to the near relation naomi who has come back from the country of moab is offering for a price that bit of land which was our brother elimelechs
 and it was in my mind to give you the chance of taking it with the approval of those seated here and of the responsible men of my people if you are ready to do what it is right for a relation to do then do it but if you will not do it say so to me now for there is no one who has the right to do it but you and after you myself and he said i will do it
 then boaz said on the day when you take this field you will have to take with it ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead so that you may keep the name of the dead living in his heritage
 and the near relation said i am not able to do the relations part for fear of damaging the heritage i have you may do it in my place for i am not able to do it myself
 now in earlier times this was the way in israel when property was taken over by a near relation or when there was a change of owner to make the exchange certain one man took off his shoe and gave it to the other and this was a witness in israel
 so the near relation said to boaz take it for yourself and he took off his shoe
 then boaz said to the responsible men and to all the people you are witnesses today that i have taken at a price from naomi all the property which was elimelechs and everything which was chilions and mahlons
 and further i have taken ruth the moabitess who was the wife of mahlon to be my wife to keep the name of the dead man living in his heritage so that his name may not be cut off from among his countrymen and from the memory of his town you are witnesses this day
 and all the people who were in the public place and the responsible men said we are witnesses may the lord make this woman who is about to come into your house like rachel and leah which two were the builders of the house of israel and may you have wealth in ephrathah and be great in beth lehem
 may your family be like the family of perez the son whom tamar gave to judah from the offspring which the lord may give you by this young woman
 so boaz took ruth and she became his wife and he went in to her and the lord made her with child and she gave birth to a son
 and the women said to naomi a blessing on the lord who has not let you be this day without a near relation and may his name be great in israel
 he will be a giver of new life to you and your comforter when you are old for your daughter in law who in her love for you is better than seven sons has given birth to him
 and naomi took the child and put her arms round it and she took care of it
 and the women who were her neighbours gave it a name saying naomi has a child and they gave him the name of obed he is the father of jesse the father of david
 now these are the generations of perez perez became the father of hezron
 and hezron became the father of ram and ram became the father of amminadab
 and amminadab became the father of nahshon and nahshon became the father of salmon
 and salmon became the father of boaz and boaz became the father of obed
 and obed became the father of jesse and jesse became the father of david
 the song of songs which is solomons
 let him give me the kisses of his mouth for his love is better than wine
 sweet is the smell of your perfumes your name is as perfume running out so the young girls give you their love
 take me to you and we will go after you the king has taken me into his house we will be glad and full of joy in you we will give more thought to your love than to wine rightly are they your lovers
 i am dark but fair of form o daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon
 let not your eyes be turned on me because i am dark because i was looked on by the sun my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vine gardens but my vine garden i have not kept
 say o love of my soul where you give food to your flock and where you make them take their rest in the heat of the day why have i to be as one wandering by the flocks of your friends
 if you have not knowledge o most beautiful among women go on your way in the footsteps of the flock and give your young goats food by the tents of the keepers
 i have made a comparison of you o my love to a horse in pharaohs carriages
 your face is a delight with rings of hair your neck with chains of jewels
 we will make you chains of gold with ornaments of silver
 while the king is seated at his table my spices send out their perfume
 as a bag of myrrh is my well loved one to me when he is at rest all night between my breasts
 my love is to me as a branch of the cypress tree in the vine gardens of en gedi
 see you are fair my love you are fair you have the eyes of a dove

 cedar trees are the pillars of our house and our boards are made of fir trees

 he took me to the house of wine and his flag over me was love

 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem by the roes of the field do not let love be moved till it is ready
 the voice of my loved one  see he comes dancing on the mountains stepping quickly on the hills
 my loved one is like a roe see he is on the other side of our wall he is looking in at the windows letting himself be seen through the spaces
 my loved one said to me get up my love my fair one and come away
 for see the winter is past the rain is over and gone

 the fig tree puts out her green fruit and the vines with their young fruit give a good smell get up from your bed my beautiful one and come away
 o my dove you are in the holes of the mountain sides in the cracks of the high hills let me see your face let your voice come to my ears for sweet is your voice and your face is fair

 my loved one is mine and i am his he takes his food among the flowers
 till the evening comes and the sky slowly becomes dark come my loved one and be like a roe on the mountains of bether
 by night on my bed i was looking for him who is the love of my soul i was looking for him but i did not see him
 i will get up now and go about the town in the streets and in the wide ways i will go after him who is the love of my soul i went after him but i did not see him
 the watchmen who go about the town came by me to them i said have you seen him who is my hearts desire
 i was but a little way from them when i came face to face with him who is the love of my soul i took him by the hands and did not let him go till i had taken him into my mothers house and into the room of her who gave me birth
 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem by the roes of the field let not love be moved till it is ready
 who is this coming out of the waste places like pillars of smoke perfumed with sweet spices with all the spices of the trader
 see it is the bed of solomon sixty men of war are about it of the army of israel
 all of them armed with swords trained in war every man has his sword at his side because of fear in the night
 king solomon made himself a bed of the wood of lebanon
 he made its pillars of silver its base of gold its seat of purple the middle of it of ebony
 go out o daughters of jerusalem and see king solomon with the crown which his mother put on his head on the day when he was married and on the day of the joy of his heart
 see you are fair my love you are fair you have the eyes of a dove your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of gilead

 till the evening comes and the sky slowly becomes dark i will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense

 my loved one put his hand on the door and my heart was moved for him
 i got up to let my loved one in and my hands were dropping with myrrh and my fingers with liquid myrrh on the lock of the door
 i made the door open to my loved one but my loved one had taken himself away and was gone my soul was feeble when his back was turned on me i went after him but i did not come near him i said his name but he gave me no answer
 the keepers who go about the town overtook me they gave me blows and wounds the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me
 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem if you see my loved one what will you say to him that i am overcome with love
 what is your loved one more than another o fairest among women what is your loved one more than another that you say this to us
 my loved one is white and red the chief among ten thousand
 his head is as the most delicate gold his hair is thick and black as a raven
 his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the water streams washed with milk and rightly placed
 his face is as beds of spices giving out perfumes of every sort his lips like lilies dropping liquid myrrh
 his hands are as rings of gold ornamented with beryl stones his body is as a smooth plate of ivory covered with sapphires
 his legs are as pillars of stone on a base of delicate gold his looks are as lebanon beautiful as the cedar tree
 his mouth is most sweet yes he is all beautiful this is my loved one and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem
 where is your loved one gone o most fair among women where is your loved one turned away that we may go looking for him with you
 my loved one is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to take food in the gardens and to get lilies
 i am for my loved one and my loved one is for me he takes food among the lilies
 you are beautiful o my love as tirzah as fair as jerusalem you are to be feared like an army with flags
 let your eyes be turned away from me see they have overcome me your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of gilead
 your teeth are like a flock of sheep which come up from the washing every one has two lambs and there is not one without young
 like pomegranate fruit are the sides of your head under your veil
 there are sixty queens and eighty servant wives and young girls without number
 my dove my very beautiful one is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the dearest one of her who gave her birth the daughters saw her and gave her a blessing yes the queens and the servant wives and they gave her praises
 who is she looking down as the morning light fair as the moon clear as the sun who is to be feared like an army with flags
 i went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley and to see if the vine was in bud and the pomegranate trees were in flower
 before i was conscious of it 
 come back come back o shulammite come back come back so that our eyes may see you what will you see in the shulammite a sword dance
 how beautiful are your feet in their shoes o kings daughter  the curves of your legs are like jewels the work of the hands of a good workman
 your stomach is a store of grain with lilies round it and in the middle a round cup full of wine
 your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth
 your neck is as a tower of ivory your eyes like the waters in heshbon by the doorway of bath rabbim your nose is as the tower on lebanon looking over damascus
 your head is like carmel and the hair of your head is like purple in whose net the king is prisoner
 how beautiful and how sweet you are o love for delight
 you are tall like a palm tree and your breasts are like the fruit of the vine
 i said let me go up the palm tree and let me take its branches in my hands your breasts will be as the fruit of the vine and the smell of your breath like apples
 and the roof of your mouth like good wine flowing down smoothly for my loved one moving gently over my lips and my teeth
 i am for my loved one and his desire is for me
 come my loved one let us go out into the field let us take rest among the cypress trees
 let us go out early to the vine gardens let us see if the vine is in bud if it has put out its young fruit and the pomegranate is in flower there i will give you my love
 the mandrakes give out a sweet smell and at our doors are all sorts of good fruits new and old which i have kept for my loved one
 oh that you were my brother who took milk from my mothers breasts  when i came to you in the street i would give you kisses yes i would not be looked down on
 i would take you by the hand into my mothers house and she would be my teacher i would give you drink of spiced wine drink of the pomegranate
 his left hand would be under my head and his right hand about me
 i say to you o daughters of jerusalem do not let love be moved till it is ready
 who is this who comes up from the waste places resting on her loved one it was i who made you awake under the apple tree where your mother gave you birth there she was in pain at your birth
 put me as a sign on your heart as a sign on your arm love is strong as death and wrath bitter as the underworld its coals are coals of fire violent are its flames
 much water may not put out love or the deep waters overcome it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would be judged a price not great enough
 we have a young sister and she has no breasts what are we to do for our sister in the day when she is given to a man
 if she is a wall we will make on her a strong base of silver and if she is a door we will let her be shut up with cedar wood
 i am a wall and my breasts are like towers then was i in his eyes as one to whom good chance had come
 solomon had a vine garden at baal hamon he let out the vine garden to keepers every one had to give a thousand bits of silver for its fruit
 my vine garden which is mine is before me you o solomon will have the thousand and those who keep the fruit of them two hundred
 you who have your resting place in the gardens the friends give ear to your voice make me give ear to it
 come quickly my loved one and be like a roe on the mountains of spice
 in the eighth month in the second year of darius the word of the lord came to zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying
 the lord has been very angry with your fathers
 and you are to say to them these are the words of the lord of armies come back to me says the lord of armies and i will come back to you
 be not like your fathers to whom the voice of the earlier prophets came saying be turned now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not give ear to me or take note says the lord
 your fathers where are they and the prophets do they go on living for ever
 but my words and my orders which i gave to my servants the prophets have they not overtaken your fathers and turning back they said as it was the purpose of the lord of armies to do to us in reward for our ways and our doings so has he done
 on the twenty fourth day of the eleventh month the month shebat in the second year of darius the word of the lord came to zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying
 i saw in the night a man on a red horse between the mountains in the valley and at his back were horses red black white and of mixed colours
 then i said o my lord what are these and the angel who was talking to me said to me i will make clear to you what they are
 and the man who was between the mountains answering me said these are those whom the lord has sent to go up and down through the earth
 and the man who was between the mountains answering said to the angel of the lord we have gone up and down through the earth and all the earth is quiet and at rest
 then the angel of the lord answering said o lord of armies how long will it be before you have mercy on jerusalem and on the towns of judah against which your wrath has been burning for seventy years
 and the lord gave an answer in good and comforting words to the angel who was talking to me
 and the angel who was talking to me said to me let your voice be loud and say these are the words of the lord of armies i am greatly moved about the fate of jerusalem and of zion
 and i am very angry with the nations who are living untroubled for when i was only a little angry they made the evil worse
 so this is what the lord has said i have come back to jerusalem with mercies my house is to be put up in her says the lord of armies and a line is to be stretched out over jerusalem
 and again let your voice be loud and say this is what the lord of armies has said my towns will again be overflowing with good things and again the lord will give comfort to zion and take jerusalem for himself
 and lifting up my eyes i saw four horns
 and i said to the angel who was talking to me what are these and he said to me these are the horns which have sent judah israel and jerusalem in flight
 and the lord gave me a vision of four metal workers
 then i said what have these come to do and he said these are the horns which sent judah in flight and kept him from lifting up his head but these men have come to send fear on them and to put down the nations who are lifting up their horns against the land of judah to send it in flight
 make your request to the lord for rain in the time of the spring rains even to the lord who makes the thunder flames and he will give them showers of rain to every man grass in the field
 for the images have said what is not true and the readers of signs have seen deceit they have given accounts of false dreams they give comfort to no purpose so they go out of the way like sheep they are troubled because they have no keeper
 my wrath is burning against the keepers of the flock and i will send punishment on the he goats for the lord of armies takes care of his flock the people of judah and will make them like the horse of his pride in the fight
 from him will come the keystone from him the nail from him the bow of war from him will come every ruler
 together they will be like men of war crushing down their haters into the earth of the streets in the fight they will make war because the lord is with them and the horsemen will be shamed
 and i will make the children of judah strong and i will be the saviour of the children of joseph and i will make them come back again for i have had mercy on them they will be as if i had not given them up for i am the lord their god and i will give them an answer
 and ephraim will be like a man of war and their hearts will be glad as with wine and their children will see it with joy their hearts will be glad in the lord
 with the sound of the pipe i will get them together for i have given the price to make them free and they will be increased as they were increased
 though i had them planted among the peoples they will keep me in mind in far countries and they will take care of their children and will come back
 and i will make them come back out of the land of egypt and will get them together out of assyria and i will take them into the land of gilead and it will not be wide enough for them
 and they will go through the sea of egypt and all the deep waters of the nile will become dry and the pride of assyria will be made low and the power of egypt will be taken away
 and their strength will be in the lord and their pride will be in his name says the lord
 let your doors be open o lebanon so that fire may be burning among your cedars
 give a cry of grief o fir tree for the fall of the cedar because the great ones have been made low give cries of grief o you oaks of bashan for the strong trees of the wood have come down
 the sound of the crying of the keepers of the flock  for their glory is made waste the sound of the loud crying of the young lions  for the pride of jordan is made waste
 this is what the lord my god has said take care of the flock of death
 whose owners put them to death and have no sense of sin and those who get a price for them say may the lord be praised for i have much wealth and the keepers of the flock have no pity for them
 for i will have no more pity for the people of the land says the lord but i will give up everyone into his neighbours hand and into the hand of his king and they will make the land waste and i will not keep them safe from their hands
 so i took care of the flock of death for those who made profit out of the flock and i took for myself two rods naming one beautiful and the other bands and i took care of the flock
 and in one month i put an end to the three keepers of the flock for my soul was tired of them and their souls were disgusted with me
 and i said i will not take care of you if death comes to any let death be its fate if any is cut off let it be cut off and let the rest take one anothers flesh for food
 and i took my rod beautiful cutting it in two so that the lords agreement which he had made with all the peoples might be broken
 and it was broken on that day and the sheep traders who were watching me were certain that it was the word of the lord
 and i said to them if it seems good to you give me my payment and if not do not give it so they gave me my payment by weight thirty shekels of silver
 and the lord said to me put it into the store house the price at which i was valued by them and i took the thirty shekels of silver and put them into the store house in the house of the lord
 then i took my other rod the one named bands cutting it in two so that the relation of brothers between judah and israel might be broken
 and the lord said to me take again the instruments of a foolish keeper of sheep
 for see i will put a sheep keeper over the land who will have no care for that which is cut off and will not go in search of the wanderers or make well what is broken and he will not give food to that which is ill but he will take for his food the flesh of the fat and let their feet be broken
 a curse on the foolish keeper who goes away from the flock  the sword will be on his arm and on his right eye his arm will become quite dry and his eye will be made completely dark
 the word of the lord about israel the lord by whom the heavens are stretched out and the bases of the earth put in place and the spirit of man formed inside him has said
 see i will make jerusalem a cup of shaking fear to all the peoples round about when jerusalem is shut in
 and it will come about in that day that i will make jerusalem a stone of great weight for all the peoples all those who take it up will be badly wounded and all the nations of the earth will come together against it
 in that day says the lord i will put fear into every horse and make every horseman go off his head and my eyes will be open on the people of judah and i will make every horse of the peoples blind
 and the families of judah will say in their hearts the people of jerusalem have their strength in the lord of armies their god
 in that day i will make the families of judah like a pot with fire in it among trees and like a flaming stick among cut grain they will send destruction on all the peoples round about on the right hand and on the left and jerusalem will be living again in the place which is hers that is in jerusalem
 and the lord will give salvation to the tents of judah first so that the glory of the family of david and the glory of the people of jerusalem may not be greater than that of judah
 in that day the lord will be a cover over the people of jerusalem and he who is feeble among them in that day will be as strong as david and the family of david will be as god as the angel of the lord before them
 and it will come about on that day that i will take in hand the destruction of all the nations who come against jerusalem
 and i will send down on the family of david and on the people of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of prayer and their eyes will be turned to the one who was wounded by their hands and they will be weeping for him as for an only son and their grief for him will be bitter like the grief of one sorrowing for his oldest son
 in that day there will be a great weeping in jerusalem like the weeping of hadad rimmon in the valley of megiddon
 and the land will give itself to weeping every family separately the family of david by themselves and their wives by themselves the family of nathan by themselves and their wives by themselves
 the family of levi by themselves and their wives by themselves the family of shimei by themselves and their wives by themselves
 and all the other families by themselves and their wives by themselves
 in that day there will be a fountain open to the family of david and to the people of jerusalem for sin and for that which is unclean
 and it will come about on that day says the lord of armies that i will have the names of the images cut off out of the land and there will be no more memory of them and i will send all the prophets and the unclean spirit away from the land
 and if anyone goes on acting as a prophet then his father and his mother who gave him life will say to him you may not go on living for you are saying what is false in the name of the lord and his father and his mother will put a sword through him when he does so
 and it will come about in that day that the prophets will be shamed every man on account of his vision when he is talking as a prophet and they will not put on a robe of hair for purposes of deceit
 but he will say i am no prophet but a worker on the land for i have been an owner of land from the time when i was young
 and if anyone says to him what are these wounds between your hands then he will say those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends
 awake  o sword against the keeper of my flock and against him who is with me says the lord of armies put to death the keeper of the sheep and the sheep will go in flight and my hand will be turned against the little ones
 and it will come about that in all the land says the lord two parts of it will be cut off and come to an end but the third will be still living there
 and i will make the third part go through the fire cleaning them as silver is made clean and testing them as gold is tested and they will make their prayer to me and i will give them an answer i will say it is my people and they will say the lord is my god
 see a day of the lord is coming when they will make division of your goods taken by force before your eyes
 for i will get all the nations together to make war against jerusalem and the town will be overcome and the goods taken from the houses and the women taken by force and half the town will go away as prisoners and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the town
 then the lord will go out and make war against those nations as he did in the day of the fight
 and in that day his feet will be on the mount of olives which is opposite jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives will be parted in the middle to the east and to the west forming a very great valley and half the mountain will be moved to the north and half of it to the south
 and the valley will be stopped  and you will go in flight as you went in flight from the earth shock in the days of uzziah king of judah and the lord my god will come and all his holy ones with him
 and in that day there will be no heat or cold or ice
 and it will be unbroken day such as the lord has knowledge of without change of day and night and even at nightfall it will be light
 and on that day living waters will go out from jerusalem half of them flowing to the sea on the east and half to the sea on the west in summer and in winter it will be so
 and the lord will be king over all the earth in that day there will be one lord and his name one
 and all the land will become like the arabah from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem and she will be lifted up and be living in her place from the doorway of benjamin to the place of the first doorway to the doorway of the angle and from the tower of hananel to the kings wine crushing places men will be living in her
 and there will be no more curse but jerusalem will be living without fear of danger
 and this will be the disease which the lord will send on all the peoples which have been warring against jerusalem their flesh will be wasted away while they are on their feet their eyes will be wasted in their heads and their tongues in their mouths
 and it will be on that day that a great fear will be sent among them from the lord and everyone will take his neighbours hand and every mans hand will be lifted against his neighbours
 and even judah will be fighting against jerusalem and the wealth of all the nations round about will be massed together a great store of gold and silver and clothing
 and the horses and the transport beasts the camels and the asses and all the beasts in those tents will be attacked by the same disease
 and it will come about that everyone who is still living of all those nations who came against jerusalem will go up from year to year to give worship to the king the lord of armies and to keep the feast of tents
 and it will be that if any one of all the families of the earth does not go up to jerusalem to give worship to the king the lord of armies on them there will be no rain
 and if the family of egypt does not go up or come there they will be attacked by the disease which the lord will send on the nations
 this will be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to keep the feast of tents
 on that day all the bells of the horses will be holy to the lord and the pots in the lords house will be like the basins before the altar
 and every pot in jerusalem and in judah will be holy to the lord of armies and all those who make offerings will come and take them for boiling their offerings in that day there will be no more traders in the house of the lord of armies
 and lifting up my eyes i saw a man with a measuring line in his hand
 and i said to him where are you going and he said to me to take the measure of jerusalem to see how wide and how long it is
 and the angel who was talking to me went out and another angel went out and meeting him
 said to him go quickly and say to this young man jerusalem will be an unwalled town because of the great number of men and cattle in her
 for i says the lord will be a wall of fire round about her and i will be the glory inside her
 ho ho  go in flight from the land of the north says the lord for i have sent you far and wide to the four winds of heaven says the lord
 ho  zion go in flight from danger you who are living with the daughter of babylon
 for this is what the lord of armies has said in the way of glory he has sent me to the nations which have taken your goods for anyone touching you is touching what is most dear to him
 for at the shaking of my hand over them their goods will be taken by those who were their servants and you will see that the lord of armies has sent me
 give songs of joy o daughter of zion for i come and i will make my resting place among you says the lord
 and a number of nations will be joined to the lord in that day and will become my people and i will be living among you and you will see that the lord of armies has sent me to you
 and judah will be the lords heritage in the holy land and jerusalem will again be his
 let all flesh be quiet and make no sound before the lord for he is awake and has come from his holy resting place
 and he let me see joshua the high priest in his place before the angel of the lord and the satan at his right hand ready to take up a cause against him
 and the lord said to the satan may the lords word be sharp against you o satan the word of the lord who has taken jerusalem for himself is this not a burning branch pulled out of the fire
 now joshua was clothed in unclean robes and he was in his place before the angel
 and he made answer and said to those who were there before him take the unclean robes off him and let him be clothed in clean robes
 and let them put a clean head dress on his head so they put a clean head dress on his head clothing him with clean robes and to him he said see i have taken your sin away from you
 and the angel of the lord made a statement to joshua and said
 these are the words of the lord of armies if you will go in my ways and keep what i have put in your care then you will be judge over my temple and have the care of my house and i will give you the right to come in among those who are there
 give ear now o joshua the high priest you and your friends who are seated before you for these are men who are a sign for see i will let my servant the branch be seen
 for see the stone which i have put before joshua on one stone are seven eyes see the design cut on it will be my work says the lord of armies and i will take away the sin of that land in one day
 in that day says the lord of armies you will be one anothers guests under the vine and under the fig tree
 and the angel who was talking to me came again awaking me as a man out of his sleep
 and he said to me what do you see and i said i see a light support made all of gold with its cup on the top of it and seven lights on it and there are seven pipes to every one of the lights which are on the top of it
 and two olive trees by it one on the right side of the cup and one on the left
 and i made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me what are these my lord
 then the angel who was talking to me answering me said have you no knowledge of what these are and i said no my lord
 this is the word of the lord to zerubbabel saying not by force or by power but by my spirit says the lord of armies
 who are you o great mountain before zerubbabel you will become level and he will let all see the headstone with cries of grace grace to it
 then the word of the lord came to me saying
 the hands of zerubbabel have put the base of this house in place and his hands will make it complete and it will be clear to you that the lord of armies has sent me to you
 for who has had a poor opinion of the day of small things for they will be glad when they see the weighted measuring line in the hand of zerubbabel then he said in answer to me these seven lights are the eyes of the lord which go quickly up and down through all the earth
 and i made answer and said to him what are these two olive trees on the right side of the light support and on the left
 and answering a second time i said to him what are these two olive branches through whose gold pipes the oil is drained out
 and he said in answer to me have you no knowledge what these are and i said no my lord
 and he said these are the two sons of oil whose place is by the lord of all the earth
 then again lifting up my eyes i saw a roll in flight through the air
 and he said to me what do you see and i said a roll going through the air it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide
 then he said to me this is the curse which goes out over the face of all the land for long enough has every thief gone without punishment and long enough has every taker of false oaths gone without punishment
 and i will send it out says the lord of armies and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of him who takes a false oath by my name and it will be in his house causing its complete destruction with its woodwork and its stones
 and the angel who was talking to me went out and said to me let your eyes be lifted up now and see the ephah which is going out
 and i said what is it and he said this is an ephah which is going out and he said further this is their evil doing in all the land
 and i saw a round cover of lead lifted up and a woman was seated in the middle of the ephah
 and he said this is sin and pushing her down into the ephah he put the weight of lead on the mouth of it
 and lifting up my eyes i saw two women coming out and the wind was in their wings and they had wings like the wings of a stork and they took the ephah lifting it up between earth and heaven
 and i said to the angel who was talking to me where are they taking the ephah
 and he said to me to make a house for her in the land of shinar and they will make a place ready and put her there in the place which is hers
 and again lifting up my eyes i saw four war carriages coming out from between the two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass
 in the first war carriage were red horses and in the second black horses
 and in the third white horses and in the fourth horses of mixed colour
 and i made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me what are these my lord
 and the angel answering said to me these go out to the four winds of heaven from their place before the lord of all the earth
 the carriage in which are the black horses goes in the direction of the north country the white go to the west and those of mixed colour go in the direction of the south country
 and the red ones go to the east and they made request that they might go up and down through the earth and he said go up and down through the earth so they went up and down through the earth
 then crying out to me he said see those who are going to the north country have given rest to the spirit of the lord in the north country
 and the word of the lord came to me saying
 take the offerings of those who went away as prisoners from heldai tobijah and jedaiah and from the family of josiah the son of zephaniah who have come from babylon
 and take silver and gold and make a crown and put it on the head of zerubbabel
 and say to him these are the words of the lord of armies see the man whose name is the branch under whom there will be fertile growth
 and he will be the builder of the temple of the lord and the glory will be his and he will take his place as ruler on the seat of power and joshua will be a priest at his right hand and between them there will be a design of peace
 and the crown will be for grace to heldai and tobijah and jedaiah and the son of zephaniah to keep their memory living in the house of the lord
 and those who are far away will come and be builders in the temple of the lord and it will be clear to you that the lord of armies has sent me to you
 and it came about in the fourth year of king darius that the word of the lord came to zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month the month chislev
 now they of beth el had sent sharezer and regem melech to make a request for grace from the lord
 and to say to the priests of the house of the lord of armies and to the prophets am i to go on weeping in the fifth month separating myself as i have done in past years
 then the word of the lord of armies came to me saying
 say to all the people of the land and to the priests when you went without food and gave yourselves to grief in the fifth and the seventh months for these seventy years did you ever do it because of me
 and when you are feasting and drinking are you not doing it only for yourselves
 are not these the words which the lord said to you by the earlier prophets when jerusalem was full of people and wealth and the towns round about her and the south and the lowland were peopled
 and the word of the lord came to zechariah saying
 this is what the lord of armies has said let your judging be upright and done in good faith let every man have mercy and pity for his brother
 do not be hard on the widow or the child without a father on the man from a strange country or on the poor let there be no evil thought in your heart against your brother
 but they would not give attention turning their backs and stopping their ears from hearing
 and they made their hearts like the hardest stone so that they might not give ear to the law and the words which the lord of armies had said by the earlier prophets and there came great wrath from the lord of armies
 and it came about that as they would not give ear to his voice so i would not give ear to their voice says the lord of armies
 but with a storm wind i sent them in flight among all the nations of whom they had no knowledge so the land was waste after them so that no man went through or came back for they had made waste the desired land
 and the word of the lord of armies came to me saying
 these are the words of the lord of armies i am angry about the fate of zion i am angry about her with great wrath
 this is what the lord has said i have come back to zion and will make my living place in jerusalem and jerusalem will be named the town of good faith and the mountain of the lord of armies the holy mountain
 this is what the lord of armies has said there will again be old men and old women seated in the open spaces of jerusalem every man with his stick in his hand because he is so old
 and the open spaces of the town will be full of boys and girls playing in its open spaces
 this is what the lord of armies has said if this is a wonder to the rest of this people is it a wonder to me says the lord of armies
 this is what the lord of armies has said see i will be the saviour of my people from the east country and from the west country
 and i will make them come and be living in jerusalem and they will be to me a people and i will be to them a god in good faith and in righteousness
 this is what the lord of armies has said let your hands be strong you who are now hearing these words from the mouths of the prophets that is to say in the days when the base of the house of the lord of armies has been put in place for the building of the house that is the temple
 for before those days there was no payment for a mans work or for the use of a beast and there was no peace for him who went out or him who came in because of the attacker for i had every man turned against his neighbour
 but now i will not be to the rest of this people as i was in the past says the lord of armies
 for i will let the seed of peace be planted the vine will give her fruit and the land will give her increase and the heavens will give their dew and i will give to the rest of this people all these things for their heritage
 and it will come about that as you were a curse among the nations o children of judah and children of israel so i will give you salvation and you will be a blessing have no fear and let your hands be strong
 for this is what the lord of armies has said as it was my purpose to do evil to you when your fathers made me angry says the lord of armies and my purpose was not changed
 so in these days it is again my purpose to do good to jerusalem and to the children of judah have no fear
 these are the things which you are to do let every man say what is true to his neighbour and let your judging give peace in your towns
 let no one have any evil thought in his heart against his neighbour and have no love for false oaths for all these things are hated by me says the lord
 and the word of the lord of armies came to me saying
 this is what the lord of armies has said the times of going without food in the fourth month and in the fifth and the seventh and the tenth months will be for the people of judah times of joy and happy meetings so be lovers of good faith and of peace
 this is what the lord of armies has said it will again come about that when peoples and those living in great towns come
 and the people of one town go to another and say let us certainly go with a request for grace from the lord and to give worship to the lord of armies then i will go with you
 and great peoples and strong nations will come to give worship to the lord of armies in jerusalem and to make requests for grace from the lord
 this is what the lord of armies has said in those days ten men from all the languages of the nations will put out their hands and take a grip of the skirt of him who is a jew saying we will go with you for it has come to our ears that god is with you
 a word of the lord the lord has come to the land of hadrach and damascus is his resting place for the towns of aram are the lords
 as well as hamath which is by its limit and tyre and zidon because they are very wise
 and tyre made for herself a strong place and got together silver like dust and the best gold like the earth of the streets
 see the lord will take away her heritage overturning her power in the sea and she will be burned up with fire
 ashkelon will see it with fear and gaza bent with pain and ekron for her hope will be shamed and the king will be cut off from gaza and ashkelon will be unpeopled
 and a mixed people will be living in ashdod and i will have the pride of the philistines cut off
 and i will take away his blood from his mouth and his disgusting things from between his teeth and some of his people will be kept for our god and he will be as a family in judah and ekron as one living in jerusalem
 and i will put my forces in position round my house so that there may be no coming and going and no cruel master will again go through them for now i have seen his trouble
 be full of joy o daughter of zion give a glad cry o daughter of jerusalem see your king comes to you he is upright and has overcome gentle and seated on an ass on a young ass
 and he will have the war carriage cut off from ephraim and the horse from jerusalem and the bow of war will be cut off and he will say words of peace to the nations and his rule will be from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth
 and as for you because of the blood of your agreement i have sent out your prisoners from the deep hole in which there is no water
 and they will come back to you o daughter of zion as prisoners of hope today i say to you that i will give you back twice as much
 for i have made judah a bow bent for my use i have made ephraim the arrows of the bow i will make your sons o zion take up arms against your sons o greece and will make you like the sword of a man of war
 and the lord will be seen over them and his arrow will go out like the thunder flame and the lord god sounding the war horn will go in the storm winds of the south
 the lord of armies will be a cover for them and they will overcome crushing under foot the armed men they will take their blood for drink like wine they will be full like the sides of the altar
 and the lord their god will be their saviour in that day giving them food like the flock of his people for they will be like the jewels of a crown shining over his land
 for how good it is and how beautiful  grain will make the young men strong and new wine the virgins
 the word of the lord which came to zephaniah the son of cushi the son of gedaliah the son of amariah the son of hezekiah in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah
 i will take away everything from the face of the earth says the lord
 i will take away man and beast i will take away the birds of the heaven and the fishes of the sea causing the downfall of the evil doers and cutting man off from the face of the earth says the lord
 and my hand will be stretched out on judah and on all the people of jerusalem cutting off the name of the baal from this place and the name of the false priests
 and the worshippers of the army of heaven on the house tops and the lords worshippers who take oaths by milcom
 and those who are turned back from going after the lord and those who have not made prayer to the lord or got directions from him
 let there be no sound before the lord god for the day of the lord is near for the lord has made ready an offering he has made his guests holy
 and it will come about in the day of the lords offering that i will send punishment on the rulers and the kings sons and all who are clothed in robes from strange lands
 and in that day i will send punishment on all those who come jumping over the doorstep and make their masters house full of violent behaviour and deceit
 and in that day says the lord there will be the sound of a cry from the fish doorway and an outcry from the new town and a great thundering from the hills and cries of grief from the people of the hollow
 because of the downfall of all the people of canaan all those who were weighted down with silver have been cut off
 and it will come about at that time that i will go searching through jerusalem with lights and i will send punishment on the men who have become like wine stored over long who say to themselves the lord will not do good and will not do evil
 and their wealth will be violently taken away and their houses will be made waste they will go on building houses and never living in them and planting vine gardens but not drinking the wine from them
 the great day of the lord is near it is near and coming very quickly the bitter day of the lord is near coming on more quickly than a man of war
 that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and sorrow a day of wasting and destruction a day of dark night and deep shade a day of cloud and thick dark
 a day of sounding the horn and the war cry against the walled towns and the high towers
 and i will send trouble on men so that they will go about like the blind because they have done evil against the lord and their blood will be drained out like dust and their strength like waste
 even their silver and their gold will not be able to keep them safe in the day of the lords wrath but all the land will be burned up in the fire of his bitter wrath for he will put an end even suddenly to all who are living in the land
 come together make everyone come together o nation without shame
 before the lord sends you violently away in flight like the waste from the grain before the burning wrath of the lord comes on you before the day of the lords wrath comes on you
 make search for the lord all you quiet ones of the earth who have done what is right in his eyes make search for righteousness and a quiet heart it may be that you will be safely covered in the day of the lords wrath
 for gaza will be given up and ashkelon will become waste they will send ashdod out in the middle of the day and ekron will be uprooted
 sorrow to the people living by the sea the nation of the cherethites  the word of the lord is against you o canaan the land of the philistines i will send destruction on you till there is no one living in you
 and the land by the sea will be grass land with houses for keepers of sheep and walled places for flocks
 the land by the sea will be for the rest of the children of judah by the sea they will give their flocks food in the houses of ashkelon they will take their rest in the evening for the lord their god will take them in hand and their fate will be changed
 my ears have been open to the bitter words of moab and the words of shame of the children of ammon which they have said against my people lifting themselves up against the limit of their land
 for this cause by my life says the lord of armies the god of israel truly moab will become like sodom and the children of ammon like gomorrah given up to waste plants and salt pools and unpeopled for ever the rest of my people will take their property the overflow of my nation will take their heritage
 this will be their fate because of their pride because they have said evil lifting themselves up against the people of the lord of armies
 the lord will let himself be seen by them for he will make all the gods of the earth feeble and men will go down before him in worship everyone from his place even all the sea lands of the nations
 and you ethiopians will be put to death by my sword
 and his hand will be stretched out against the north for the destruction of assyria and he will make nineveh unpeopled and dry like the waste land
 and herds will take their rest in the middle of her all the beasts of the valley the pelican and the porcupine will make their living places on the tops of its pillars the owl will be crying in the window the raven will be seen on the doorstep
 this is the town which was full of joy living without fear of danger saying in her heart i am and there is no other how has she been made waste a place for beasts to take their rest in  everyone who goes by her will make hisses waving his hand
 sorrow to her who is uncontrolled and unclean the cruel town 
 she gave no attention to the voice she had no use for teaching she put no faith in the lord she did not come near to her god
 her rulers are like loud voiced lions in her her judges are wolves of the evening crushing up the bones before the morning
 her prophets are good for nothing persons full of deceit her priests have made the holy place unclean and have gone violently against the law
 the lord in her is upright he will not do evil every morning he lets his righteousness be seen he is unchanging but the evil doer has no sense of shame
 i have had the nations cut off their towers are broken down i have made their streets a waste so that no one goes through them destruction has overtaken their towns so that there is no man living in them
 i said certainly you will go in fear of me and come under my training so that whatever i may send on her may not be cut off before her eyes but they got up early and made all their works evil
 for this reason go on waiting for me says the lord till the day when i come up as a witness for my purpose is to send for the nations and to get the kingdoms together so that i may let loose on them my passion even all my burning wrath for all the earth will be burned up in the fire of my bitter passion
 for then i will give the people a clean language so that they may all make prayer to the lord and be his servants with one mind
 from over the rivers of ethiopia and from the sides of the north they will come to me with an offering
 in that day you will have no shame on account of all the things in which you did evil against me for then i will take away from among you those who were lifted up in pride and you will no longer be lifted up with pride in my holy mountain
 but i will still have among you a quiet and poor people and they will put their faith in the name of the lord
 the rest of israel will do no evil and say no false words the tongue of deceit will not be seen in their mouth for they will take their food and their rest and no one will be a cause of fear to them
 make melody o daughter of zion give a loud cry o israel be glad and let your heart be full of joy o daughter of jerusalem
 the lord has taken away those who were judging you he has sent your haters far away the king of israel even the lord is among you you will have no more fear of evil
 in that day it will be said to jerusalem have no fear o zion let not your hands be feeble
 the lord your god is among you as a strong saviour he will be glad over you with joy he will make his love new again he will make a song of joy over you as in the time of a holy feast
 i will take away your troubles lifting up your shame from off you
 see at that time i will put an end to all who have been troubling you i will give salvation to her whose steps are uncertain and get together her who has been sent in flight and i will make them a cause of praise and an honoured name in all the earth when i let their fate be changed
 at that time i will make you come in at that time i will get you together for i will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth when i let your fate be changed before your eyes says the lord
